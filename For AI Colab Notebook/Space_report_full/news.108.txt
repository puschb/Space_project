Jonathan's Space Report

No. 108      1992 Mar 30

I hope the email version of this is getting to people. If you see this
on the net and were expecting to have already received it by email, let
me know. It's nice to know who reads this regularly, so even if you
don't want to be on the email list, consider dropping me a note if you
find these reports useful.

First, a correction to last week's report. Soyuz TM-14 was launched
at 1054 UTC not 0854 UTC on Mar 17. This reduces the flight hours
of Viktorenko, Kaleri and Flade by 2 hours. Thanks to Ed O'Grady
for spotting this typo which crept in half way through my sums!

The Soviet Union's last imaging spy satellite, Kosmos-2153, reentered on
Mar 13 after 247 days in space. This left Kosmos-2175, launched on Jan
21, as the SNG's (Commonwealth of Independent States) only remaining
imaging satellite, and it was expected to reenter on Mar 20. No replacement
had been launched by Mar 24.

The STS-45 mission continues in orbit. There have been some problems
with the FAUST (Far UV Space Telescope) and the SEPAC (electron gun
experiment) but both have got at least some data. Overall things are
going pretty well and I'm having fun watching NASA Select seeing the
folks I used to know at Huntsville hunched over their consoles at the
POCC (Hi, Chuck). Landing is due on Apr 2.

Kosmos-895 reentered on Mar 22. Launched in Feb 1977, it was
a Soviet military signals intelligence satellite.

There haven't been many launches recently so I thought I'd
take the opportunity to review the first quarter of the year,
giving launch vehicle, payload, organization responsible for the
launch and the payload, and manufacturer of the payload. Note that
barely half of the launches so far are by the ex-SSSR. This is way
down on previous years; of 22 launches to the same time last year
17 were Soviet, so not only has the ex-SSSR launch rate gone 
down but that for the rest of the world has increased somewhat
(not statistically significantly relative to last year, but
there has been a trend over the past few years). 

Of course, who owns the various Russian satellites is somewhat
speculative and probably not known by anyone, even the putative
owners.

/* followups to talk.politics.space: we want our NTV!
 For those of you who have wondered why NASA Select doesnt cover
 the expendable launches anymore, I hear that the Administrator decided
 that putting non-NASA launches on NASA Select is bad PR if there is 
 a failure, since everyone thinks the failure is NASA's. Maybe a nice
 big letter writing campaign to the new Administrator might change this.
*/ Oops, I editorialized, I promise I won't do it again.

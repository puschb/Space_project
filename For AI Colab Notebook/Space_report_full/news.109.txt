Jonathan's Space Report

No. 109      1992 Apr  6

Thanks for all those who have emailed me so far; keep those
letters coming in!

Atlantis landed on runway 33 at Kennedy Space Center at 1123 UTC on Apr 2.
The mission makes Kathy Sullivan the women's record holder for cumulative
spaceflight time. All experiments returned some data. Atlantis' next
mission is the Tethered Satellite expeiment.
The static firing of Endeavour was carried out on Apr 6, clearing the
way to its first launch next month.

A new SNG spy satellite, Kosmos-2182, was launched by Soyuz rocket on
Apr 1 around 1430 UTC, replacing Kosmos-2175 (which was deorbited on Mar
20 as expected) as their only imaging satellite. K-2182 is the same
class as K-2175, and is expected to be deorbited on May 29. It is
in a 67 degree low earth orbit.

Of the 19 new NASA astronaut candidates announced this week, only 4 are
pilot astronauts. This is the lowest ratio of pilots to mission
specialists yet and reflects the fact that more mission specialists than
pilots fly on each mission.
Breakdown:
Pilots 4, Mission Specialists 15
Men 16, Women 3
Civilians 9, USN 7, USAF 2, US Army 1
Ph.D  8, MD 4 (including two with both)
Last Job: Edwards AFB 1, Pax River 1, Other military 8, 
          NASA-JSC 3, JPL 1, other 5
More generic military people are being selected, fewer civilians and
fewer USAF and USN test pilots from Edwards and Pax River (the latter
reflecting the smaller number of pilot astronauts). I don't understand
the preference for military mission specialists given the lack
of DoD missions on the schedule.

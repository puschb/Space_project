Jonathan's Space Report

Kosmos-2184 was launched from the Russian spaceport Plesetsk on Apr 15
around 0800 UT.  After the second stage circularization burn and payload
separation it was in a 967 x 1014 km orbit inclined 83 degrees. It is a 
Doppler beacon navigation satellite for the SNG navy, replacing
Kosmos-2074 launched in 1990.

Meanwhile back in Transoxiana, Progress M-12, a robot supply ship, was
launched from Baykonur on Apr 19 toward the Mir space station. Cosmonauts
Aleksandr Viktorenko and Aleksandr Kaleri are aboard the station.

Space Shuttle mission STS-49, the maiden flight of orbiter Endeavour, is
planned for launch on May 4 at 1234UT.

STS-49, commanded by the NASA Chief of the Astronaut Office, Dan
Brandenstein, will be the first flight on which 4 crew members go EVA on
a single mission. (Possible exception: it depends on quite how you
define 'single mission' for the Mir). Primary spacewalk team is Pierre
Thout and Richard Hieb. They will perform EVA-1 and EVA-3, while Kathryn
Thornton and Thomas Akers will perform EVA-2. The first EVA will be to
attach a new UTC/CSD Orbus 21S kick stage to the Hughes Intelsat VI F-3
satellite stranded in low orbit. EVA-2 and EVA-3 will be part of the
ASEM experiment to practice assembling mock space station components;
the idea is to get a feel for what EVA construction crews can and can't
do. It's a more sophisticated version of the EASE/ACCESS experiments
done in 1985 on mission 61-B. 

STS-49 cargo:
 RMS (Remote Manipulator System)
 
 Hughes Cradle with Orbus 21S PKM, capture bar, docking adapter,
  and MFR (Manipulator Foot Restraint)
 
 MPESS (Mission Peculiar Experiment Support Structure) with
  ASEM Node boxes(2), Truss pyramid components, Grapple fixture
  and EVA rescue device prototypes: Astrorope, Telescopic pole,
  Bi-stem pole,	Inflatable pole, Crew propulsive device (based on Skylab-HHMU)

As far as I can tell the Hughes Cradle is a new design; the MPESS
cross-bay truss pallet has flown 13 times previously.

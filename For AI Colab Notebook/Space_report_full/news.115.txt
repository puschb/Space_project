STS-49 Mission Report (Continued)
---------------------------------

The third rendevous with Intelsat began around 1530 UTC on May 13 with
an orbit adjustment maneuver. A software problem with the  targeting
code led to cancellation of the TPI (Terminal Phase Initiation) burn; at
1929 UTC a 'TI delay burn' was executed to keep Endeavour in the correct
phasing for a later rendezvous attempt. The three spacewalkers, Pierre
Thuot, Richard Hieb and Tom Akers, had already partially depressed the
airlock to 5 PSI; they remained in the airlock during the delay. The TPI
burn was finally executed at 2057.55 UTC and the depressurization was
resumed at 2109. The hatch opened for the longest ever EVA at 2112; over
the next hour (at 2119, 2153, 2203, and 2213) four mid  course
correction burns were made as Endeavour approached the Intelsat VI F-3
satellite; braking began at 2219. Intelsat was in a 355x370 km orbit at 28.3 deg.

By around the same time the EVA crew had assembled the lower plane of
the ASEM pyramid - three long poles forming a triangle attached to the
top of the payload bay walls. Akers attached himself to the ASEM using a
foot restraint; Hieb attached himself to the starboard sill of the
payload bay; and Thout attached himself to the RMS arm which was
operated from the cabin by Bruce Melnick. The Endeavour was then flown
slowly towards Intelsat until at 2359.31 UTC on May 13 the three
astronauts simultaneously grabbed the lower end of it and stopped its
rotation.

At 0045 UTC on May 14 Melnick started moving Thuot around the satellite
and at 0122.57 the infamous capture bar was soft docked to the satellite
by Hieb and Thuot. Thout then used an EVA power tool to hard dock the
bar at 0132.55. Thout then exited the RMS and at 0147.41 the RMS
grappled the capture bar grapple fixture allowing Hieb and Akers to
release the satellite; it had been hand-held for 1h 48m. At 0300 UTC the
Intelsat was hard berthed on the docking adapter to the Orbus 21S PKM,
and the RMS released the capture bar. The grapple extensions on the bar
were then removed and the PKM (Perigee Kick Motor) electrically
activated and mated to the satellite. The three astronauts returned to
the airlock.

At 0440 UTC the first attempt to deploy the satellite failed. After two
further failures and some rearranging of circuit breakers the satellite
was sprung out of the payload bay at 0453.22 UTC. Hieb returned to the
bay for cleanup tasks and the Endeavour moved away (a small burn at 0516
and a larger one at 0539). Finally at 0541 the airlock was repressurized
for a total EVA time of 8h 29m.

EVA-4 began at 2107 UTC on May 14, with Akers and Thornton in the
payload bay. They completed assembly of the ASEM pyramid, demonstrated
the Crew Propulsive Device, a  gas gun similar to the HHMUs used on
Gemini 4 and Skylab, and installed extra components on the MPESS pallet.
 The RMS was then used to unberth the MPESS from the  payload bay and
dock it to the ASEM pyramid. It was then undocked from the pyramid and
at 0241 UTC on May 15 it was reberthed in the bay. The RMS ungrappled
the MPESS at 0245 as the pyramid was disassembled. The crew returned to
the airlock at 0437 and repressurization began at 0452, for an EVA time
of 7h 45m.

Deorbit from the 343 x 360 km orbit occurred at 1955 UTC on May 16 and
Endeavour landed on runway 22 at Edwards Air Force Base at 2057.38 UTC
on May 16. The drag chute was used for the first time to slow the craft
on rollout.

Next mission is STS-50/Columbia, the first flight of the Extended
Duration Orbiter kit.

STS-49 Statistics and Records
-----------------------------

* First flight of OV-105 Endeavour
* First dual active rendezvous (both Intelsat VI F-3 and OV-105
  maneuvered to meet each other)
* Dan Brandenstein gains most flight hours of any active US astronaut 
  (789:05 in 4 missions) and most rendezvous experience (5 rv in 3 missions)
  and is the first person to fly 4 different Orbiters (Challenger, Discovery,
  Columbia, Endeavour, but so far not Atlantis).
* Longest ever EVA (Hieb, Thuot, Akers: 08:29)
* Kathryn Thornton holds record for longest EVA by a woman (07:45 beating
  Savitskaya's record of 03:35)
* First 3-person EVA since 1973 and first ever in which all 3 were
  outside the spacecraft
* First use of drag chute on landing for piloted spaceship
* First manual in-orbit assembly of a rocket stage to a spacecraft 
  (first such assembly in general was docking of Gemini 10 with
  Agena 5005, which was used to move Gemini 10 to a higher orbit).
* 3 rendezvous in a single mission, joint record with Gemini 9 (1966),
  Soyuz T-15 (1986), and Progress M-7 (1991).
* Thuot holds record for largest number of docking failures !!

Pedantic Definition Corner: Spacewalks and Depress
--------------------------------------------------
                                                                                 
 NASA reported that EVA-3 was the 100th EVA (Extra-Vehicular Activity)
in history. You have to be a little careful about how you define EVAs.
In 1969 Apollo 9 astronauts spacewalked in Earth orbit from a docked
Apollo command module and  lunar module; Scott and McDivitt EVA'd from
the command module and Schweickart from the LM. Since these were
separate spaceships with separate airlocks, albeit docked to each other
at the time, I count these as two separate EVAs  even though they were
simultaneous, making STS-49/EVA-3 spacewalk no. 101. But actually I
think a more interesting concept than EVA is 'depress work', time spent
in a spacesuit under depressurized (vacuum) conditions whether inside or
outside the shell of a spacecraft. NASA sort of implicitly agrees with
me since it counts EVA time up to the moment of repressurization of the
airlock, even if the crew spend an extra hour inside the airlock with
the hatch closed. After all, what's dangerous (and hence in some sense
significant) about EVA is that the astronaut is protected no longer by
the pressurized spaceship cabin but only by a spacesuit - the spacesuit
is their new spaceship. Logically extending this idea, I like to count
cases where the spaceship cabin is depressurized even when the crew do
not emerge. This is really pretty much the same as an EVA except for the
'E'. In Gemini and Apollo, the cabin was depressurized sometimes for
'Equipment Dumps' where the crew threw extra stuff out the hatch, e.g.
lunar overshoes on Moon landings after all the moonwalks were done.
These typically lasted 2 to 3 minutes, there were 9 of them. On the
Skylab 2 flight, docking problems led to the crew having to suit up,
depressurize the cabin, and disassemble their docking probe to repair
it, before they could successfully dock their spacecraft. This depress
is very poorly documented and not included in most lists of EVAs since
the crew stayed in the cabin. Finally, the Soyuz-11 spaceship was
unintentionally depressurized in June 1971 leading to the deaths of the
crew. Not counting this last, the total number of occasions when crews
worked in spacesuits in a depressurized environment (hmm, need an
acronym here clearly - how about DP for depressurizations?), the total
number of DPs by STS-49 EVA-3 is then 111 as opposed to 100 in the NASA
list of EVAs.

Launches
-----------

The Palapa B4 satellite was launched by Delta at 0040 UTC on May 14 from
Launch Complex 17B at Cape Canaveral. This was the 589th Thor launch,
209th Delta launch, and the 23rd Delta 2 launch. All 23 Delta 2 launches
have been successful.

Palapa B4 is a Hughes HS376 class comsat, owned by the Indonesian
telecommunications agency PT Telekomunikasi, formerly PERUMTEL.
Indonesia was the first Third World country with a domestic comsat
system, as comsats have advantages for communications in a country made
up of lots of islands.

The Palapa series is summarized below.

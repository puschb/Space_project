Launches
--------

The third launch of India's ASLV rocket was the first successful one. 
The SROSS (Streched Rohini Satellite) 3 test satellite was inserted into
orbit on May 20. The indigenous Indian program has met with mixed
success to date. This launch clears the way for development of
the more ambitious PSLV (Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle).

Indian satellites:
Aryabhata  (1975, launched by Kosmos from Kapustin Yar, Russia)
Bhaskara   (1979, launched by Kosmos from Kapustin Yar, Russia)
RS-1	   (1979, by SLV-3 from Sriharikota, fell in sea)
RS-1       (1980, by SLV-3 from Sriharikota, first Indian orbital launch)
RS-D-1	   (1981, by SLV-3 from Sriharikota, orbit lower than planned)
Apple      (1981, by Ariane from Kourou, Guyane)
Bhaskara 2 (1981, by Kosmos from Kapustin Yar, Russia)
Insat 1A   (1982, by Delta from Cape Canaveral, Florida)
RS-D-2     (1983, by SLV-3 from Sriharikota)
Insat 1B   (1983, by PAM-D from Challenger, low Earth orbit)
SROSS-1    (1987, by ASLV from Sriharikota, fell in sea)
IRS-1      (1988, by Vostok from Baykonur, Kazakhstan)
SROSS-2    (1988, by ASLV from Sriharikota, fell in sea)
INSAT 1C   (1988, by Ariane from Kourou, Guyane)
Insat 1D   (1990, by Delta from Cape Canaveral, Florida)
IRS-1B     (1991, by Vostok from Baykonur, Kazakhstan)
SROSS-3    (1992, by ASLV from Sriharikota, 4th Indian orbital launch)

Launch Vehicles of The World
----------------------------

With the successful Indian launch, it's a good moment to
look at the current launch capabilities of the various nations. Only 
vehicles with at least one successful orbital launch are listed.

USA:        Scout G, Delta 7925, Atlas E, Atlas Centaur (I,II), 
            Titan II/III/IV, STS, Pegasus
Russia:     Vostok, Soyuz, Molniya, Proton 3/4, Energiya
Ukraine:    Kosmos, Tsiklon 2/3, Zenit
France/ESA: Ariane
Japan:      Mu 3S, H-1
China:      Chang Zheng 2C, 2E, 3, 4
Israel:     Shaviyt
India:      ASLV

Only one country has developed space launch capability and
then abandoned it: Britain, which scrapped its Black Arrow in 1971.

Shuttle Notes
-------------

Record update: NASA Headline News credited Brandenstein with the
rendezvous record. Although he has done more rendezvous than any other
active astronaut, the all time record is shared by Tom Stafford and
Vladimir Dzhanibekov at 6 rendezvous each. The record for successful
dockings (at  least soft dock) is held by Charles Conrad with 8
dockings.

Correction: The record for docking failures is held by the Skylab 2
crew, not by Pierre Thuot. It took them 9 tries before they were hard
docked.

On May 18 the Intelsat VI F-3 satellite raised its perigee, 
entering a  9152x  71379 km x  7.53 deg orbit. By May 21 it
was in circular synchronous orbit.

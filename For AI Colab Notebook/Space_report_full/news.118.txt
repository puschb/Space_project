Launches
--------

A Ukranian-built Kosmos launch vehicle was launched from the Russian
Plesetsk spaceport on Jun 3 carrying 8 small naval communications
satellites (Kosmos-2187 through Kosmos-2194) into 1400 x 1500 km orbits
inclined 74 degrees.

NASA's Extreme Ultraviolet Explorer was launched at 1640 UTC on Jun 7
into  a 514 x 528 km orbit inclined 28 degrees by a McDonnell Douglas
Delta 6920-10 vehicle. EUVE carries three scanning EUV telescopes
(two for the 70-400 A range, one for the 400-760 A range) and
a Deep Survey/Spectrometer instrument.

The Intelsat K satellite was launched by General Dynamics' first Atlas
IIA Centaur, AC-105, on Jun 9. The Centaur IIA stage entered a 195x 
35732 km orbit inclined  26.46 deg, and the Intelsat K separated; after
the first burn of its liquid apogee motor (probably a British built
Leros 1) its orbit on Jun 11 was  3133x  35758 km inclined 17.5 degrees.
Several further burns will be required before it enters geostationary
orbit. Intelsat K is a GE 5000 series comsat, originally built for RCA
Americom as Satcom K4, and sold to Intelsat as a stopgap between the
Intelsat VI and Intelsat VII series spacecraft.

The General Dynamics Atlas Centaur range now includes the following
variants:
Name		First Launch
 Atlas I 	AC-69,  1990 Jul 25
 Atlas II	AC-102, 1991 Dec 7
 Atlas IIA	AC-105, 1992 Jun 9
 Atlas IIAS	[Scheduled 1993]

The Atlas I is essentially identical with the old Atlas SLV-3G/Centaur D-1AR.
Atlas II and IIA are improved, stretched versions. IIAS will have solid
strapons added to the first stage.

Reentries
---------

The Resurs-F remote sensing spacecraft launched on Apr 29 landed in
Kazakhstan on May 29.

The Kosmos-2182 recon satellite reentered on May 30.

Shuttle Notes
-------------

The STS-50 launch is due on Jun 25.
The STS-46 stack is now on pad 39B.

Shuttle Mission STS-50
------------------------

The STS-50 mission continues with astronauts Richards, Bowersox, Dunbar,
Meade, Baker, DeLucas and Trinh carrying out experiments for the United
States Microgravity Lab 1 Spacelab mission. The spaceship is in a 300 km
orbit at 28 degrees inclination.

Meanwhile, Aleksandr Viktorenko and Aleksandr Kaleri continue in orbit
aboard the Mir complex. They are due to be relieved by Anatoli Solov'yov
and Sergey Avdeev on Jul 27.

Launches
--------

Progress M-13 was launched from Baykonur in Kazakhstan on Jun 30.
The NPO Energiya robot resupply ship is scheduled to dock with the
Mir station on Jun 2 to replace the Progress M-12 cargo craft.

A Resurs-F  spacecraft was launched on Jun 23 from Plesetsk into an 82
degree orbit. The spacecraft, built by KB Foton of Russia, is based on
the old Vostok design and carries mapping cameras which will be returned
to Earth next month with their film. 

Reentries
---------

The Indian Space Research Organization's SROSS 3 satellite reentered
on Jun 24 after a month in orbit. SROSS 3 was the first launch
of ISRO's ASLV rocket to reach orbit, but the perigee was lower than
intended.

The Strategic Defense Initiative Organization's Delta Star satellite,
launched in March 1989 to observe the infrared, optical and ultraviolet
emissions from rocket launches, reentered on Jun 23. It was switched off
in Dec 1989.

Quarterly Summary
-----------------

Here is a review of launches for the second quarter of 1992, giving
launch vehicle, payload, organization responsible for the launch and the
payload, and manufacturer of the payload.  The summary comparison with
last year shows that launches from Plesetsk are down by a factor of 2
over last year. Navigation satellites and remote sensing satellites have
been going up from Plesetsk at about the same rate, but the spy
satellite and military communications  satellite programs have been
sharply cut. Small number statistics make it difficult to be sure, but
it also seems that the Ukranian-built satellite programs (minor
military, oceanography, electronic intelligence) have been cut or
cancelled, and it has been reported that funding for the weather
satellite program  is in trouble.

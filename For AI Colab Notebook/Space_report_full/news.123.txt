Mir
----

The Progress M-13 cargo ship was undocked from Mir's front port on Jul
24. Soyuz TM-15 was launched at 0608 UTC on Jul 27 carrying Russian
astronauts Solov'yov and Avdeev and French astronaut Tognini into a 190
x 200 km orbit inclined 51.6 deg. Later on Jul 27 it moved to a 223 x
343 km orbit,  and on Jul 28 it docked with Mir in its 405 x 410 km
orbit. The Mir complex now consists of Mir, the Kvant module, the
Kvant-2 and Kristall axial modules, and the Soyuz TM-14 and Soyuz TM-15
ferry craft. Crew are Aleksandr Viktorenko, Aleksandr Kaleri, Anatoli
Solov'yov, Sergey Avdeev, and Michel Tognini.

Shuttle Mission STS-46
------------------------

Crew of mission STS-46 are Loren Shriver, Andy Allen, Jeff Hoffman,
Marsha Ivins, Franklin Chang-Diaz, Claude Nicollier, and Franco Malerba.
Malerba is a payload specialist for the Italian Space Agency, Nicollier
is an ESA astronaut seconded to NASA as a mission specialist. Cargo of
STS-46 is the Tethered Satellite, the EOIM experiment, the EURECA
satellite, and some GAS can experiments. Atlantis was launched at 1357
UTC on Jul 31 from LC 39B at Kennedy Space Center into a 422 x 431 km orbit
inclined 28.5 degrees. The ESA retrievable experiment carrier EURECA was
deployed by the  RMS arm at 0707 UTC on Aug 2, after a 1 day delay due
to problems with the payload. These problems continued with the first
EURECA orbit raising burn being aborted at 1236 UTC due to
communications dropouts. EURECA was left in a 430 x 440 km orbit at 28.5
degrees. At around 1100 UTC on Aug 3 Atlantis lowered its orbit to 294 x
301 km for TSS operations. The TSS deploy boom was extended by around 1630 UTC
on Aug 4. Problems were encountered separating the umbilicals from
the TSS satellite which delayed the flyaway (reeling out of the satellite
on its tether). Initial flyaway was attempted at 2121 UTC but aborted after
only 10 cm of motion. Flyaway was resumed at 2251 UTC Aug 4, but was
suspended overnight at a distance of a few hundred metres because
of a snag in the tether reel. So far the TSS satellite and tether 
dynamics seem to be stable.

12 humans are now in orbit, equalling the current record. They include
natives of the USA, Russia, Latvia, France, Switzerland, Italy,
and Costa Rica.

Launches
---------

Ariane V51 was launched on 1992 Jul 9 at 2242 UTC. Payloads were the
Indian Space Research Organization's comsat Insat IIA, and the European
Telecommunication Satellite Organization's  Eutelsat II F-4, an
Aerospatiale Spacebus 100 design. Both used liquid apogee motors to
enter geostationary orbit. On Jul 28 Insat IIA was at 73 deg E drifting
0.6 deg W per day. On Jul 29 Eutelsat II F-4 was on station at 8.0 deg
E.

A Ukranian Tsiklon rocket launched six small comm relay satellites from
the Russian Plesetsk spaceport on Jul 13 about 1800 UTC. Kosmos-2197,
Kosmos-2198, Kosmos-2199, Kosmos-2200, Kosmos-2201, and Kosmos-2202 were
built by NPO Prikladnoi Mekhaniki and  placed in circular 1400 km orbits
at 82 deg inclination. Two of the satellites are test versions of the
commercial Gonets variant, the remainder are the standard military
communications version. This is the first launch of the Tsiklon since
the  fall of the Soviet Union.

Two Proton heavy launch vehicles were launched in July from Baykonur; a
Jul 14 launch orbited a Gorizont communications satellite, and a Jul 29
launch orbited three GLONASS navigation satellites (probably called
Kosmos-2204, 2205 and 2206). On Jul 29 the Gorizont was on station at
11.7 deg W. Both Gorizont and GLONASS satellites are built by NPO
Prikladnoi Mekhaniki.

The Japanese ISAS space agency's GEOTAIL magnetospheric research probe
was launched by a McDonnell Douglas Delta 6925 on Jul 24 from Cape
Canaveral. This is the first time ISAS has used a non-Japanese launch
vehicle for one of its spacecraft. The probe was inserted into an
initial 184 km by 341000 km orbit inclined 28 degrees. It is due to make
its first lunar swingby on Sep 8. The spacecraft carries seven
instruments to study plasmas and fields.

A small NASA experiment, the DUVE Diffuse Ultraviolet Experiment to
study the interstellar medium, was carried as a piggyback payload on the
Delta second stage of the Geotail launch. It was placed in a 217 x 1482
km orbit inclined 27 degrees.

An imaging spy satellite, Kosmos-2203, was launched by Soyuz from
Plesetsk on Jul 24. It replaces Kosmos-2186 and is  in a 180 x 350 km
orbit at 62.8 degrees.

A remote sensing satellite, probably in the Resurs-F series, was
launched by Soyuz from Plesetsk on Jul 30 around 1100 UTC.


Reentries
----------

The Resurs-F remote sensing satellite launched on Jun 23 landed Jul 9 
after 16 days in orbit. It was the old Resurs-F1 model, the first
such to fly this year.

Visual observers report the 8th KH-11 KENNAN spy satellite has not been
observed since June and has probably been deorbited, according to the
RAE. (I don't see the CSS N2L notes anymore, anyone willing to email
them to me or let me know an ftp site?)

The Indian Space Research Organization's SROSS 3 satellite reentered on
Jul 14, not in June as reported in JSR 120. (Space Command confused the
payload and the rocket final stage).

The Kosmos-2186 spy satellite reentered on Jul 24.

Discovery is on Pad 39A awating launch on mission STS-53. This mission
will deploy a classified reconnaissance satellite for the National
Reconnaissance Office and a group of small radar calibration satellites
called ODERACS. The mission will be commanded by David Walker.
Pilot is Robert Cabana and mission specialists are Guion Bluford,
Jim Voss and Mike Clifford.

The MSTI-1 (Miniature Seeker Technology Integration) satellite was
launched into a 331 x 443 km polar (96.8 deg) orbit by Scout S210C from
Space Launch Complex 5 at Vandenberg Air Force Bace at 1345 UTC on Nov
21. The MSTI-1 is operated by the USAF Phillips Lab for the Strategic
Defense Initiative Organization (SDIO) and was built by JPL. It carries
an IR camera which will be used for imaging ground targets. The mission
is intended as a test of the new small spacecraft bus.

Navstar GPS 32 was launched on Nov 22 by Delta from Launch Complex 17
at Cape Canaveral. The Rockwell-built navigation satellite, placed
into an initial 160 x 20340 km transfer orbit inclined 34.7 deg, will
be placed in a 20000 km high orbit and carries atomic clocks to provide
navigation signals. This was the 30th launch of McDonnell Douglas' Delta II
launch vehicle. All 30 launches have been successful, an unrivalled
record.

Kosmos-2220 was launched on Nov 20 by Soyuz from Plesetsk. It is an
imaging recon satellite operated by Russian military intelligence,
replacing Kosmos-2210 which was launched in September. Kosmos-2210
was expected to complete its mission around Nov 20 and reenter.
Kosmos-2220 will remain in orbit until about Jan 20.

The Resurs-500 spacecraft was recovered from the Pacific Ocean off
Seattle by the ship Marshal Krylov on Nov 22. The spacecraft, owned by
Konsortsium Evropa-Amerika 500, had been launched from Plesetsk on Nov
15.

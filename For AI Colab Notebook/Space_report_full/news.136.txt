Jonathan's Space Report 

No. 136		1992 Dec 8
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Space Shuttle Discovery was launched at 1324 UTC on Dec 2 into a  369 x
379 km x 57 deg orbit. At 1918 UTC the DoD-1 satellite was deployed. On
Dec 3 the orbit was lowered to 317 x 331 km; on Dec 4 an attempt to
deploy the ODERACS satellites failed due to electrical problems. Landing
is scheduled for Dec 9. 

STS-53 is the 15th flight of Discovery.  This is the 8th Shuttle flight
in 1992, a record surpassed only by the 9 flights in 1985. More
impressive, however, is NASA's success at meeting target launch dates.
Since the delay to STS-39 in early 1991, there have been no major delays
to the manifested missions, and every countdown this year has resulted
in a launch, with the exception of the first STS-45 countdown which was
scrubbed due to bad weather, delaying the mission by one day. Although
we must expect scheduling problems in the future, up to and including
loss of another orbiter, it does seem that NASA has ridden up the
learning curve and can now operate this reusable piloted spacecraft 
on a schedule whose reliability is at least comparable, say, with
unpiloted expendable rockets like Delta.

STS-53 Mission Specialist Mike Clifford is the first of the 1990
astronaut group to fly in space; the last of the 1987 group astronauts
made their first flight on STS-47. Things have improved a lot since the
days when astronauts had to wait over a decade for their first flight! 
(See table below; group 5 was the first to feel the post-Apollo slump;
group 9 the first to be delayed by the Challenger accident. This table
ignores the effects of resignations prior to first flight).

Robert 'Hoot' Gibson has been named the fourth Chief of the NASA
astronaut office, succeeding Alan Shepard (1964-1974),
John Young (1974-1987), and Dan Brandenstein (1987-1992).


A Gorizont C-band comsat was launched by Proton from Baykonur on Nov 27
for the Russian Ministry of Communications.  A Molniya-3 elliptical
orbit TV relay satellite was launched from Plestesk on Dec 2. The
Molniya launch vehicle is a  Soyuz with an additional Blok-L fourth
stage.

A Titan 4 launch vehicle, possibly a 404 variant, was orbited from Space
Launch Complex 4-East at Vandenberg AFB on Nov 28. The USA-86 payload is
most likely an Advanced Crystal imaging recon satellite, replacing
the KH-11/Crystal launched in 1987.

Arianespace carried out its seventh launch of the year on Dec 1, using
the Ariane 42P variant to place Space Communications Corp. of Japan's
Superbird A1 satellite into orbit.  The Space Systems/Loral satellite
replaces Superbird A, which failed in orbit due to ground controller
error.

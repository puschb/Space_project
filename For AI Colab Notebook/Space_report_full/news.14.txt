The space shuttle Atlantis was launched at 18:47:00 GMT today
on the STS-30 mission. At 22:30 GMT the mission was proceeding
nominally and Magellan deployment was scheduled for 01:04 GMT.

The Progress-41 ferry seems to have run into trouble after undocking
from Mir on Apr 20.  Instead of being deorbited, according to NORAD
tracking it ended up in a 124x390 km orbit.  It then slowly decayed,
reentering at 1202 GMT on Apr 25 from an orbit with a perigee of 94 km. 
This could indicate an engine underburn, possibly due to lack of fuel
after the unplanned boost of the Mir station to a storage orbit. 

The Foton-2 materials processing flight was orbited on Apr 26 from
Plesetsk. Based on the Vostok craft, the satellite will remain in
orbit for several weeks and land in the USSR.


Kosmos-2018, launched on Apr 20, is a GRU recon satellite, 
for high resolution imaging. It will probably operate until
late June.

Another old weather satellite, Kosmos-206, reentered on Apr 22

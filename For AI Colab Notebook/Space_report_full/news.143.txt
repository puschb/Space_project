STS-55
------

Columbia is on pad 39A, ready for launch later in the month for
the Spacelab D-2 mission.

Mir
---

Progress TM-15 undocked from Mir on Feb 4. Later the same day, in a 400
km altitude orbit, it deployed the Znamya solar sail. The Progress was
used to point the sail for the mirror experiment, where sunlight was
reflected onto Western Europe; the patch of light was observed by the
Mir cosmonauts. Znamya was then jettisoned; because of its high surface
area to mass ratio, atmospheric drag rapidly lowered its orbit. By 0930
on Feb 5 it was in a 191 x 203 km orbit and it reportedly has since
reentered.

Launches
--------

A McDonnell Douglas Delta 7925 rocket launched the Rockwell Navstar GPS
22 satellite on Feb 3 into a 174x  20387 km x 34.8 deg orbit. The
satellite's on board apogee motor was then due to circularize the orbit
at 20000 km and change the inclination to 55 degrees. The satellite has
been given the designation USA 88. 

I note that the classified satellite deployed by Discovery in December
has still not been given either a USA number or a NORAD/Space Command
permanent  satellite catalog number. This is the first time that any US
payload has been omitted from the official satellite catalog, and seems
a particularly pathetic attempt at pretending it doesn't exist, given
that the object was observed by amateurs at sites across the world.  The
omission is further confirmation that the spacecraft has a signals
intelligence mission, since historically these satellites are treated
with the most secrecy. It will be interesting to see whether the US will
include the satellite in its next list of launchings submitted to the
United Nations under the Convention on Registration of Space Objects.
Only satellite USA-72 has so far been omitted from these listings
entirely, although other classified payloads have been listed with
erroneous or misleading orbital information.

Orbital Sciences Corp.'s third Pegasus launch was a success. NASA's
NB-52 (S/N 008) flew from Edwards AFB to Kennedy Space Center in Florida
carrying the  Pegasus F3 launch vehicle, nicknamed 'Santos Dumont'. On
Feb 9 the NB-52 took off from the  SLF (Shuttle Landing Facility,
RW05/33) at Kennedy at around 1320 UTC and flew until it was 130 km off
the coast at 13 km altitude. The Pegasus was dropped at 1430 UTC and its
Hercules Orion 50S first stage motor ignited 5 seconds later. All three
stages worked well and Pegasus placed its Orion 38 third stage and the
110 kg Brazilian SCD-1 satellite in a 750 x 770 km x 25.0 deg orbit.  
The 'Satelite de Coleta de Dados' is operated by the Instituto Nacional
de Pesquisas Espacias (INPE) and will be used to forward environmental
data from remote stations in the Amazon, basin to a central ground
station.

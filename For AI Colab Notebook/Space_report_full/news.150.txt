STS-56 
----------------- 

The Spartan-201 satellite was deployed using the RMS arm on Apr 11 at
0611 UTC. It carried an ultraviolet coronagraph and a white light
coronagraph for studies of the Sun. On Apr 12 the NIXT x-ray telescope
was launched on a sounding rocket from White Sands to get a simultaneous
x-ray image of the Sun. Discovery carried out re-rendezvous maneuvers
on Apr 12 and the Spartan satellite was grappled with the arm at
0720 on Apr 13. By 0802 it was reberthed in the payload bay.
Discovery fired its OMS engines to return from orbit at 1034 on Apr 17;
main gear touchdown on RW33 at Kennedy Space Center was at 1137 on Apr 17,
for a mission duration of 9d 6h 8m 19s. Discovery's next mission
is STS-51 in June. Columbia is due to launch on mission STS-55 on Apr 24.


Erratum: The Apr 6 launch attempt of STS-56 was an RSLS hold, not an
RSLS abort. The distinction is that the main engines had not started, so
it was not considered an abort. The hold was due to a faulty sensor and
not a software problem as was reported by various media;  the workaround
for the successful Apr 8 launch was to modify the software to ignore the
sensor and monitor it manually. To keep the statistics hounds happy, I
here present a revised list of all occasions on which a Shuttle countdown
got past the T-31s point (when the RSLS computers take over the count)
but either did not launch or did not reach the planned orbit. This
includes 8 FRF static tests, where the orbiter engines were fired
to test them out. Each orbiter had one of these tests carried
out before its first launch. The Challenger one had to be repeated
because of engine problems on the first try. In addition, an FRF
was carried out for Discovery before the first `return to flight'
mission after the loss of Challenger. This one also had to be repeated
because of an abort one second after engine ignition.

FRF: Flight Readiness Firing (static test of Shuttle engines, intentionally
stopped after 20 second firing)
RSLS: Redundant Set Launch Sequencer
ATO : Abort To Orbit (ends up in low orbit)


Hiten Mission Ends
------------------

The Hiten space probe, operated by the Japanese scientific space agency
ISAS, has impacted the lunar surface. Hiten (MUSES-A) was launched on
1990 Jan 24 from the Kagoshima Space Center. On 1990 Mar 18 it made a
16000 km lunar flyby and separated the Hagoromo subsatellite which
entered lunar orbit. Further lunar flybys occurred on 1990 Jul 10, Aug
4, Sep 7, Oct 2, 1991 Jan 3, Jan 27, Mar 3, Apr 26 and Oct 2, at
distances between 12000 and 76000 km. On 1991 Mar 19 Hiten carried out
the first aerobraking experiment in Earth's atmosphere, with a perigee
of 125.5 km. A second aerobraking pass was made on Mar 30 at 120.2 km,
to make a planned change in Hiten's orbit. On 1992 Feb 15 after a final
2000 km flyby of the Moon Hiten fired its engine to enter a 9600 km x
49400 km x 35 deg lunar orbit. On 1993 Apr 10 at 1803.38 its orbit, by
this time perturbed to a lower periapsis, intersected the lunar surface
at 55.5 deg E, 34.0 deg S. Hiten and Hagoromo were the first new
probes in lunar orbit since Luna-24 in 1976.

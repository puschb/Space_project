STS-55
----------------- 

Columbia/Spacelab D-2 continues on orbit on mission STS-55. Landing is due
for May 6. Orbit of Columbia is 297 x 303 km x 28.5 deg.
Meanwhile Endeavour has been moved to the pad for mission
STS-57, due in June.

Gennady Manakov and Aleksandr Polischuk made a 5h 25m spacewalk
on Apr 19 to begin work on moving the Kristall module's solar
panels to the Kvant module. On this EVA they installed equipment
on the outside of the Kvant module which will be used on 
later walks to attach the panels. These later walks have now been
postponed due to damage to a crane which occurred on this EVA.

Launches
--------

The Los Alamos/Aero-Astro Corp  Alexis x-ray astronomy satellite was
launched by a three stage Orbital Sciences Corp Pegasus booster from
NASA's NB-52 on Apr 26. The B-52 took off from Edwards AFB at 1244 UTC
and dropped the Pegasus over the Pacific along the Western Test Range
near Vandenberg at 1356 UTC. During the coast between second and third
stage burns, damage to the satellite was detected. At least one of the
solar panels appears to have become detached. Although the payload was
inserted into an 800 km, 70 degree orbit, controllers could not
establish communication with it and it appears that the mission is lost.
Orbital Sciences claim that the damage to the satellite was not caused
by any Pegasus component. Alexis was to have monitored the sky in three
narrow energy bands between 0.06 and 0.1 keV; it also carried the
Blackbeard experiment to study ionospheric effects on radio
transmissions. Alexis is part of the USAF Space Test Program and is also
known as P89-1.

Kosmos-2243 is a high resolution reconnaissance satellite in a 180 x 220
km x 70.4 deg orbit.

Kosmos-2244 is an electronic intelligence satellite which
tracks ships by detecting their radio transmissions. It is working
together with Kosmos-2238, launched on Mar 30. Data from the two
satellites is compared to determine the location of the target.
They operate in a 400 x 420 km orbit inclined 65 deg.

Shuttle
----------------- 

Columbia returned to KSC aboard the 747 on May 14 and is now in the
Orbiter Processing Facility  being turned around for the STS-58 mission
in August. Next mission is Endeavour/STS-57 due for June 3; according to
the magazine Space News, pad workers have been unable to locate the
source of a crash-bang-clatter sound heard emanating from the orbiter
during pad tests. Doesn't that give you a great feeling? STS-57
will carry the Spacehab experiment module and retrieve the European
EURECA satellite.

Mir
---

Gennady Manakov and Aleksandr Poleshchuk remain in orbit aboard the Mir
complex. Soyuz TM-16 is docked to the Kristall axial port and Progress
M-16 is docked to the Kvant port. A new Progress mission is due for
launch on May 18 and will dock to the forward Mir port. Apologies
for misspelling Poleshchuk's name in previous reports; the new spelling
is consistent with the transliteration scheme I normally use.

Six small Gonets class communications satellites, Kosmos-2245 to Kosmos-2250,
were launched into a 1400 x 1420 km orbit at an inclination of 82.6 degrees
on May 11. The satellites are built by NPO Prikladnoi Mekhanikoi of Krasnoyarsk.

It has been reported that the Kosmos-2243 recon satellite launched
on Apr 27 was destroyed due to an explosion in the Blok-I third stage
of the Soyuz launch vehicle near the end of third stage burn. Space
Command cataloged the satellite (or its main fragment) as reentering
on May 6.

The Ariane launch vehicle made its much delayed first launch of the year
on May 12. The main payload was the Astra 1C television broadcasting
satellite for SES (Societe Europeene des Satellites, based in
Luxembourg) and it will be stationed at 19 degrees E over the equator.
This satellite is the fifth Hughes HS-601 comsat to be launched; two of
the five have been lost in launch accidents. A second payload was the
ARSENE satellite built by the French amateur radio group RACE (Radio
Amateur Club de L'Espace).  This launch was the first flight of the
Ariane 42L variant, with two liquid strapon boosters. The basic Ariane 4
variant without strapons is the 40, which has made two flights. The 42P
(4 flights) and 44P (2 flights) have two and four liquid strapons; the
44LP (6 flights)  has two liquids and two solids; and the 44L (13
flights) has 4 liquid boosters. Ariane 4 has made a total of 28 flights
of which one was a failure. Its main rival, the Delta II, has now made
34 flights with no failures.

The latest Delta II flight also marked the 600th launch of  McDonnell
Douglas' Thor first stage. The Thor started life in 1957 as an
intermediate range ballistic missile; it is one of the most used large
rocket stages, beaten only by the Minuteman (about 760 launches of the
M55A1/M55E1 first stage) and OKB-1's R-7 ICBM (at least 1490 launches,
of which 1424 put a payload in orbit, since pre-Sputnik suborbital tests
in 1957 to the Apr 27 launch of Kosmos-2243). 

The Delta's payload was a Rockwell Navstar navigation satellite GPS/SVN 37, 
which carries an atomic clock and operates in a 20000 km high circular orbit.
The last Navstar launch, GPS/SVN 31, carried an interesting secondary
payload, the SEDS tether experiment. Enrico Lorenzini,
one of the scientists involved in the experiment, graciously gave me some 
technical details on the mission, so I include a detailed recap of the flight
below. Opinions and errors are, of course, mine.



The SEDS 1 Mission
-------------------

Space tethers were experimented with on the Gemini XI and XII missions
in 1966 with the idea of eventually using them to provide artificial
gravity. At the time the true potential of space tethers was not
understood. Recent theoretical work has led to the idea that long
tethers can be used to generate electricity, alter a spacecraft's orbit,
and deliver probes to study the upper atmosphere. In August 1992 an
ambitious Italian Space Agency experiment on the Shuttle, TSS-1,
attempted to deploy a long tether. However, there were problems with the
deployer mechanism and the tether only got out to a quarter of a
kilometre. Although a lot was learned about tether dynamics during
retrieval - a time when the tether is least controllable - the mission
was a failure. The first fully successful tether mission was carried out
on 1993 Mar 30. The SEDS (Small Expendable Deployer System) consisted of
a small 10 kg deployer cylinder 33 cm long and a tiny 23 kg satellite
(`end mass') of similar size. The satellite was connected to the
cylinder by a rope made of Spectra-1000 which was 0.75 mm in diameter
and 20 km long. The cylinder remained attached to the Delta second stage
rocket in orbit. Here is a log of the mission events.

1993 Mar 30
Time (UTC)
0309   A Delta model 7925 launch vehicle, Delta 219,
       ignited on Launch  Complex 17A at Cape Canaveral. 9 solid Hercules GEM
       strapon boosters and an Extra Extended Long Tank Thor liquid first stage
       propelled the Delta onto a suborbital trajectory. 
0314?  The Delta ignited its single Aerojet AJ10-118K engine for the first time. 
0320?  Delta main engine cut off; the spacecraft entered a 184 x 746 km orbit 
       inclined 34.0 deg to the equator. 
0321?  The Delta's main payload separated: a PAM-D solid rocket carrying the 
       Navstar GPS 31 navigation satellite. 
0330?  The PAM-D ignited, placing itself and GPS 31 in an elliptical 
       150 x 20415 km orbit inclined 34.8 degrees. The GPS 31 would later
       fire its internal Star 37 solid motor to end up in a 20000 km circular
       orbit.
0412   Delta 219 reached first apogee at 746 km. The SEDS-1 end mass was
       released from the deployer cylinder and began to unreel down towards
       Earth.
0527   The SEDS-1 end mass was now 20 km below Delta 219 - at the end
       of its tether (pun intended). The end mass was allowed to swing
       back and forth on the tether like a huge pendulum so its dynamics
       could be studied.
0541   A knife on the deployer cylinder aboard Delta 219 cut through the
       tether, while Delta 219 was at its second apogee. The end mass
       now found itself free in orbit at an altitude of 726 km. 
       However, the combination of the backwards speed it picked up 
       while swinging on the tether and the lower altitude meant that 
       its new orbit was -50 x 726 km x 34.0 deg, with a perigee 50 km
       below the surface of the Earth.
0612   Delta 219 reignited its main engine to use up excess fuel. Earlier
       Deltas had exploded in orbit because of leftover fuel, so this
       maneuver was introduced to reduce the pollution of orbital debris.
       The Delta ended up in a 305 x 1300 km orbit inclined 36.2 deg.
0616   The path of the SEDS end mass, following its orbital trajectory, 
       intersected the atmosphere 100 km above the Pacific Ocean just
       south of Baja California. The end mass and the attached tether
       burned up on reentry, and the SEDS 1 mission was at an end.

The SEDS system was developed and  built by NASA-Marshall, the
Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, and Tether Applications of
San Diego, CA; the end mass was built by NASA-Langley. A second SEDS
mission this summer will investigate the electromagnetic properties of
space tethers.

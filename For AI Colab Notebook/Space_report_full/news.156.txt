Jonathan's Space Report 

No. 156         1993 Jun 2
Off to the AAS in Berkeley for a week - there will probably
be no JSR next week. Anyone at the AAS, stop by and say hi
at my poster on Monday.

Shuttle
-------

The STS-57 launch has been delayed until the middle of June.
The delay was caused by the decision to replace a main engine
turbopump.

Here's an update on the current Shuttle schedule.

Jun  STS-57  Endeavour  Spacehab-1, GBA 5, SHOOT, Eureca retrieval,DTO-1210 EVA
Jul  STS-51  Discovery  ACTS/TOS, ORFEUS-SPAS, DTO-1210 EVA
Sep  STS-58  Columbia   Spacelab Life Sciences 2/Extended Duration Orbiter
Nov  STS-60  Discovery  Spacehab-2, GBA 6, Wake Shield Facility, RKA 
Dec  STS-61  Endeavour  HST Servicing Mission, 5 repair EVAs

Mir
---

The Progress M-18 cargo craft docked with Mir on May 24. The Mir complex
now consists of the core module, the Kvant, Kvant-2 and Kristall modules,
the Sofora structure, and the Soyuz TM-16, Progress M-17 and Progress
M-18 ferry craft. A return capsule on board Progress M-18 will be
used to return experimental samples to Earth in July.

Launches
--------

The spacecraft launched on May 21 has been confirmed as a Resurs-F
remote sensing flight. It is the Resurs-F2 model, which stays in orbit
for around 30 days. On May 26 its orbit was 228 x 233 km x 82.6 deg.


The Arsene amateur radio satellite has successfully fired its SEP Mars
apogee motor and is in a 17600 x 37000 km orbit inclined at 1 degree to
the equator. Its VHF system isn't working right but the S-band
reportedly is fine.

A Gorizont communications satellite was launched by Proton on May 27
from Baykonur. I don't have any orbital elements yet, but a Space News
article indicates that the NPO Energiya-built Blok-DM fourth stage
failed, leaving  the payload either in parking orbit or in an incorrect
transfer orbit. The Blok-DM is separate from the main UR-500K Proton
rocket built by NPO Mashinostroeniye, and is essentially considered to
be part of the payload,  like IUS stages on Shuttle missions. On
geostationary orbit missions, it burns twice, first to go from low
circular orbit to geostationary transfer orbit, and second to
circularize the transfer orbit at apogee. A bigger stage is needed for
this than for US launch vehicles: Russia's launch site in Kazakhstan is
at 46 deg North, and because of ground range constraints the initial
orbit is at 51 degrees to the equator, requiring a large velocity change
to enter the final equatorial orbit. The Blok-D series of upper stages
was originally developed for the Soviet piloted moon landing program.

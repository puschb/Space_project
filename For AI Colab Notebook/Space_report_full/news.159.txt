Shuttle
-------

Endeavour completed its rendezvous with the EURECA satellite on Jun 24.
The satellite was grappled with the RMS arm at 1353 UTC and berthed in
the payload bay at 1636. However, two antennas on the satellite failed
to close up correctly. During the spacewalk on Jun 25, astronauts David
Low and Jeff Wisoff successfully latched the antennas. This was the
first time the Spacelab Tunnel airlock has been used for a spacewalk;
this airlock is carried on all Spacelab module and Spacehab module
missions, since the tunnel to the modules connects to the usual Shuttle
airlock. The airlock was depressurized at 1300 and the astronauts opened
the hatch at 1312. As well as the EURECA work the astronauts practised
techniques for the HST repair mission. The hatch was closed at 1850 and
the repress began by 1857, making an EVA of 5 hr 57 min. A landing
attempt on Jun 29 was waved off due to bad weather; another attempt
is due on Jun 30.

Meanwhile, Discovery was rolled out to pad 39B on Jun 28.
Mission STS-51 is due for launch on July 17.

Mir
---

The EO-13 crew, Gennadiy Manakov and Aleksandr Poleshchuk, made a
spacewalk on Jun 18 to carry out further preparatory work for the next
crew's solar panel relocation experiment. As of Jun 25, both Progress
M-17 and Progress M-18 were still docked to the complex, as well as the
Soyuz TM-16 ferry. The next crew, EO-14, will be launched on July 1
aboard Soyuz TM-17. Crew commander is rookie Vasiliy Vasilevich
Tsibliev, who joined the former Soviet Air Force cosmonaut corps in
1987. Flight engineer ('bortinzhener') is  Aleksandr Aleksandrovich 
Serebrov, a member of the NPO Energiya cosmonaut group since 1978. He
has made three spaceflights, aboard Soyuz T-7, Soyuz T-8, and Soyuz
TM-8. Cosmonaut researcher is Jean-Pierre Haignere, a French Air Force
pilot who has been an astronaut trainee with CNES (Centre National
d'Etudes Spatiales) since 1985.

Launches
--------

Kosmos-2251, launched Jun 16, is the 47th in a series of small
low orbit communications satellites thought to be used by
Russian military and intelligence services. It was launched
by an 11K65M Kosmos rocket built by NPO Yuzhnoye of Ukraine.

Six small communications satellites were launched by a single
Tsiklon rocket, and have been given the designations Kosmos-2252
to Kosmos-2257. I haven't determined their exact launch date yet.

The RADCAL satellite was launched by Scout S217C from Space Launch
Complex 5 at Vandenberg on Jun 25. RADCAL, also known as P92-1, was
built by Defense Systems Inc. for the USAF Space Test Program. It will
be used by Vandenberg AFB's 40th Space Wing to calibrate the radars used
to track objects in orbit. RADCAL carries a C-band transponder operating
on the same frequency as the radars, and a GPS navigation package so
that its orbit can be precisely determined. This calibration will allow
the Space Command radars to determine orbital positions of other
satellites to within a few metres. The 87 kg satellite was due to be
placed in a 830 km polar orbit. Only one more launch of LTV's Scout
is currently planned: MSTI-2, also from Vandenberg later this year.

Hughes Communications' Galaxy 4H comsat was launched on Jun 25
by Ariane. This is the 6th HS-601 class comsat to be launched.
The satellite is a 'hybrid', with both C-band (6/4 GHz) and
Ku-band (12/11 GHz) transponders.

NASA's second SEDS (Small Expendable Deployer System) mission was
launched piggyback on a Delta second stage on Jun 26. The primary
payload was the Navstar GPS 39 navigation satellite. SEDS 2 carried the
PMG (Plasma Motor Generator) payload, with a 500m conducting tether
containing a copper cable. The tether deployer and end mass contained a
xenon gas dispenser to complete a 0.1 kV electrical circuit through the
tether with a 0.3 amp current, in a 6-hour experiment to study space
tethers' electrodynamic properties.

Rockwell's GPS 39 is the 32nd Navstar satellite to be launched
(they put them up in a fairly random order!) and the 21st of the
Block II series. The Navstar satellites carry atomic clocks
which are used to generate navigation signals.

Shuttle
-------

Launch of STS-51 is scheduled for Jul 17. The payloads are the ACTS
satellite and the ORFEUS-SPAS satellite. ACTS, the Advanced
Communications Technology Satellite, is a NASA satellite built around
Martin Marietta Astro Space's GE4000 bus. It will carry out experiments
in the 30/20 GHz Ka-band and is intended to help development of future
commercial comsats. The Japanese Superbird comsats have already
experimented with the Ka band. ACTS will use Orbital Sciences' TOS
(Transfer Orbit Stage) to reach geostationary orbit. This will be the
second TOS flight; the first launched Mars Observer aboard a Titan 3. 

ORFEUS-SPAS is a German astronomical satellite. It will be deployed by
the RMS arm and retrieved about 6 days later. The main instrument is the
1-meter Orfeus (Orbiting and Retrievable Far and Extreme UV
Spectrometer) telescope with EUV (400-1150A) and far UV (900-1250A)
spectrometers with high spectral resolution. A secondary experiment is
the Princeton Interstellar Medium Absorption Profile Spectrograph which
will study very fine structure in ultraviolet absorption lines caused by
interstellar gas in stellar spectra. The ORFEUS program is managed by
the German DARA space agency and the associated DLR institute; the
satellite uses the ASTRO-SPAS bus made by MBB (Messerschmitt-Bolkow-Blohm). 
The ASTRO-SPAS is double the size of the original SPAS (Shuttle Pallet
Satellite) which has been used on several missions (STS-7, STS-11,
STS-39). An experiment-carrying truss (USS) based on the original SPAS
structure (but without the avionics and attitude control) was also flown
on the Spacelab D-1 and D-2 missions. 

The STS-51 mission will also feature another of the DTO-1210 series of
training spacewalks, by mission specialist astronauts Maj. Carl Walz and
Dr. James Newman. Commander and Pilot of STS-51 are Capt. Frank
Culbertson and William Readdy; the third mission specialist is Cdr.
Daniel Bursch. Only Culbertson and Readdy have flown previously.


Mir
---

Progress M-18 undocked from Mir's front port at around 1725 UTC
on Jul 3, and Soyuz TM-17 docked at the same port only 20 minutes
later at 1745 UTC. The Progress vehicle was deorbited the
next day. Meanwhile, Progress M-17 remains docked to the
Kvant rear port. Astronauts Tsibliev, Serebrov, Manakov, Poleshchuk,
and Haignere are carrying out experiments aboard the station;
the latter three will return to Earth aboard Soyuz TM-16 on Jul 22.

Launches
--------

Erratum: I have corrected some more of the launch times in the table.

Erratum No 2: The tether experiment launched on Jun 26 was not
SEDS 2. The PMG experiment uses somewhat different hardware from
the SEDS deployer, although it is for the most part built by the
same groups. The PMG tether remains attached to the Delta stage
in a 192 x 850 km x 26 deg orbit.

Kosmos-2258 was launched on Jul 8. It is an electronic intelligence
ocean surveillance satellite (EORSAT) used to track surface shipping,
the third launched this year (with Kosmos-2238 and Kosmos-2244) after a
two year break with no launches. The spacecraft is in a 404 x 417 km
orbit inclined 65 degrees. The orbit is maintained in phase with the
other spacecraft with a low thrust engine. The spacecraft is made either
by NPO Mashinstroeniye of Moskva or possibly by NPO Arsenal of
Sankt-Peterburg. The Tsiklon-M 11K69 launch vehicle is a two stage
rocket based on the R-36 ICBM (known as SS-9 by NATO). The R-36/Tsiklon
series of rockets are built by the Ukranian space company NPO Yuzhnoe in
Dniepropetrovsk; the three stage civilian Tsiklon has been commercially
available for some time, but the older Tsiklon-M has only recently been
declassified.

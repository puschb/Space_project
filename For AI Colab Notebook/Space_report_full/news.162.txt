Shuttle
-------
Launch of STS-51 has been delayed until at least Aug 2. Meanwhile,
the external tank and solid rocket boosters for STS-58 have
been mated in the VAB. The STS-58 mission will be a Spacelab
mission using orbiter Columbia.

Mir
---

Soyuz TM-16 landed at 0642 UTC on Jul 22, returning Gennadiy Manakov,
Aleksandr Poleshchuk and Jean-Pierre Haignere to Earth. Vasiliy Tsibliev
and Aleksandr Serebrov remain aboard the Mir complex. Correct docking
time for Soyuz TM-17 is probably 1624 UTC on Jul 3.

Launches
--------

Kosmos-2259 was launched on Jul 14. Built by the Central Specialized
Design Bureau, it is a fourth generation imaging spy satellite. Another
Resurs-F remote sensing  satellite built by the same organization went
up on Jul 22. It is based on the Vostok spacecraft bus. 

The DSCS III F-7 comsat, built by Martin Marietta Astro Space for the
USAF, was launched by Atlas II Centaur from pad 36 at Cape Canaveral on
Jul 19. Following two straight Atlas I failures, this successful launch
will go  some way to restoring General Dynamics' reputation. All five
Atlas II/IIA launches have been successful.


An Ariane 44L put two communications satellites into orbit on Jul 22.
Hispasat 1B is the fourth Eurostar 2000 satellite built by the European
company Matra Marconi Space. Operated by the Spanish government-owned
company Hispasat, it carries 11 Ku band transponders for communications
and direct TV broadcast to the Iberian peninsula and the Canary Islands,
and a further Ku band transponder for TV transmission to  Latin America.
It also carries 4 X-band military transponders. The second payload
aboard Ariane was Insat 2B, built by and operated by the Indian Space
Research Organization. It carries 18 C-band transponders and a
meteorological instrument package.

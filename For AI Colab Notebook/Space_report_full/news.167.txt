Shuttle 
------- 

Launch of Discovery on mission STS-51 is now due for Sep 12. Meanwhile,
several new crews have been selected for 1994 missions. Of particular
interest is the crew for STS-63: it includes the first woman to fly as a
pilot on an American space mission, Eileen Collins. She is thus likely
to become the first woman ever to command a spaceflight crew on a later
mission (pilot astronauts usually fly one or two missions in the pilot
seat before being given the command seat). Also on the crew is Vladimir
Titov, who will become the second Russian to fly on the Shuttle, and the
first serving Russian military officer to do so.

Mir
---

The Expedition 14 crew of Vasiliy Tsibliev and Aleksandr Serebrov 
continue in orbit aboard the Mir complex. Aviation Week reports
that a Perseid left a visible hole in one of the solar panels.
There was no damage to the pressurized sections of the station.
The Progress M-19 cargo ferry and the Soyuz TM-17 transport ship
remain docked to the station. On Sep 2, Progress M-17 was
still in orbit almost a month after its undocking from the station,
in a test of the longevity of its onboard systems.

Other Missions
------------------

Mars Observer remains silent, probably in solar orbit as it
now seems unlikely that the MOI burn happened.

The Galileo probe flew 2400 km from minor planet (243) Ida
at 1622 UTC on Aug 28. 

To add to the loss in recent weeks of Mars Observer, NOAA-13,
Hipparcos, and the Titan 4, I omitted to report on the loss
of ESA's Olympus comsat. The satellite lost attitude control
during the Perseid shower. It was later recovered, but had
used up so much fuel it had to be moved out of geostationary
orbit and turned off. Also, the Alexis satellite went silent
again in August, but, thank goodness, they now have it back
and returning data (phew!).

Launches
--------

Two successful US expendable launches happened recently:
McDonnell Douglas launched a Delta 2 with another Navstar
navigation satellite for the USAF; and General Dynamics
launched an Atlas I Centaur with a Hughes HS-601 communications
satellite (UHF Follow On) for the US Navy. The first UHF Follow On
(UFO) satellite was left in the wrong orbit earlier in the year;
the last two successful Atlas launches are a hopeful sign
for General Dynamics after a less than ideal launch record in
recent years. Delta 2's launch record remains perfect.

A Ukranian-built Tsiklon launch vehicle was launched from the Russian
Plesetsk spaceport on Aug 31. The rocket's main payload was a Meteor-2
weather satellite, built by VNII Elektromekhaniki.  Aboard as a
piggyback payload is the Temisat  (Telespazio Micro Satellite) built by
the German company Kayser-Threde for the Italian company Telespazio. The
30 kg microsatellite will relay environmental data from field sites.

Shuttle 
------- 

Discovery was launched at 1145 UTC on Sep 12. Mission STS-51 is the 57th
Shuttle launch. The Transfer Orbit Stage was deployed at 2113 on Sep 12
and ignited at 2158 to place its ACTS (Advanced Communications
Technology Satellite) payload in geostationary transfer orbit. The
German ASTRO-SPAS carrier with the ORFEUS telescope was deployed on Sep
13 at 1506  into a 297 x 327 km orbit inclined 28.5 deg. ORFEUS-SPAS
carries an ultraviolet telescope with high spectral resolution for
absorption line studies. It is due to be retrieved before the end of the
mission. Cameras on ORFEUS-SPAS got beautiful views of Discovery as it
separated (well, *I* thought they were great). Carl Walz and Jim Newman
carried out a 7 hour 5 minute spacewalk on Sep 16 to test tools
scheduled for use in the HST repair later this year. 

Meanwhile, Columbia is due to be rolled out to pad 39B on Sep 17.

Mir
---

The Expedition 14 crew of Vasiliy Tsibliev and Aleksandr Serebrov 
continue in orbit aboard the Mir complex. 

Launches
--------

Kosmos-2262, launched on Sep 7, appears from its orbit to
be the fifth in a new series of imaging satellites which fly
two-month long missions. After a day in a 172 x 290 km x 65 degree
parking orbit, the satellite moved to an operational orbit
of 207 x 323 km x 65 degrees. Previous satellites in the
series, which have flown one a year since 1989, were Kosmos-2031,
2101, 2163, and 2225.

Shuttle Processing Explanation (or,  what are all these acronyms
anyway?):

 The Shuttle consists of an Orbiter (OV), an expendable External Tank
(ET), and a reusable pair of Redesigned Solid Rocket Motors (RSRM), also
knownas SRBs (Solid Rocket Boosters).  The OV is prepared for flight in
the Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF) which consists of three bays (one
of which is actually a separate building) after which it is towed to the
Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) and `mated to the stack' or joined to
the ET and RSRM. First, the segments of the RSRM are stacked up on a
Mobile Launch Platform (ML) and then the ET is connected to it. After
the OV is mated, a Crawler-Transporter is moved underneath the ML and
carries the ML/RSRM/ET/OV stack to one of the two pads (A or B) at
launch complex 39 (LC39) where it is eventually launched on a Space
Transportation System (STS) mission. Occasionally an OV is returned to
the Rockwell International plant in Palmdale, California for refit - an
Orbiter Maintenance Down Period or OMDP.  After launch the ML is
returned to a refurbishment area near the VAB and then is used for
stacking a new set of RSRMs.

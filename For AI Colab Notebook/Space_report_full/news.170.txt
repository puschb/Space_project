Thanks to Vladimir Agapov and Joel Runes for info included
in last week's report and in this one. Apologies to sci.space.news
readers; due to a problem with our new news software my posts
have not been getting to the net. 

Shuttle 
------- 

Columbia/STS-58 is due for launch on Oct 14.

Mir
---

The Expedition 14 crew of Vasiliy Tsibliev and Aleksandr Serebrov 
continue in orbit aboard the Mir complex. They have made three
spacewalks recently. The first one was on Sep 16 at 0557 UT and lasted 4
h 18 min. The second was on Sep 20 at 0352 UT and lasted 3h 13 min. The
third one was on Sep 28 and was scheduled to be a 4 hr 43 min spacewalk
beginning at 0120 UTC. The Sep 16 EVA overlapped with the spacewalk from
Discovery for 1h 43 min; this is the first time 4 people have been
spacewalking at once, and the first time American and Russian cosmonauts
have spacewalked at the same time. (An earlier pair of EVAs this year,
Manakov/Poleshchuk on Jun 18 and Low/Wisoff on Jun 25, were separated by
only a week; otherwise there have been only three cases of Russian and
American spacewalks occuring within a month of each other. The Russians
made the first spacewalk but then only made one more between 1965 and
1977, by which time the Gemini, Apollo and Skylab programs were long
over; then they started doing lots of EVAs from Salyut and Mir, but
until this year spacewalks from the Shuttle were relatively rare.)


Launches
--------

The first launch of the Indian Space Research Organization's PSLV (Polar
Satellite Launch Vehicle) ended in failure on Sep 20.  However, all four
stages burnt well, which is encouraging for future flights. The problem
was at second stage separation when the vehicle ended up pointing the
wrong way. The IRS-1E payload ended in the ocean; it was a remote
sensing satellite built from the IRS-1 engineering model. With the
failure of two out of three ASLV launches with Streched Rohini (SROSS)
satellites, ISRO now has three out of the last four orbital attempts in
the drink.  However, considering that these attempts were all tests of
new launch vehicles, this isn't quite as bad as it sounds, and hopefully
the second PSLV launch, scheduled for next year, will be successful.
ISRO's launch site is the Sriharikota Range (SHAR).

Meanwhile the Ariane 4 had another successful launch in its 40
configuration on Sep 26, chalking up 30 successes out of 31 launches,
compared with rival McDonnell Douglas Delta's 36 out of 36.  The
Ariane's main payload was the 1900 kg SPOT 3 remote sensing satellite.
Also on board was a passive 48 kg spherical geodetic satellite, Stella,
and an ASAP package (Ariane Structure for Auxiliary Payloads). Stella
was built by the French space agency CNES (but apparently will be used
by a German agency, can anyone confirm this?) 

The Ariane ASAP deployed  five microsatellites. First is Uribyol 2, 
built by the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology for
SATREC Korea; it carries CCD cameras, store/forward communication
equipment and a radiation  detector. The spacecraft is based on the
British Uosat bus developed by the University of Surrey's Surrey
Satellite Technology Labs (SSTL). POSAT 1 is the first Portuguese
satellite. Also using the 50 kg Uosat bus, it was built by SSTL in
collaboration with engineers from the Portuguese national engineering
lab LNETI. It carries an earth imaging camera, a GPS receiver, and a
digital signal processing experiment. Healthsat 1, a Uosat bus built by
SSTL for the American company SatelLife, will be used as a packet radio
satellite to link up doctors in Africa.  The last two satellites are
even smaller, using the 12 kg bus developed by a US company,
Interferometrics. Interferometrics' Eyesat A carries a small experiment
for monitoring of mobile industrial equipment (i.e., at least at first, 
tracking truckers). ITAmsat is an Italian amateur radio satellite, built
by Interferometrics for the ITAmsat organization and the ARI
(Associazione Radioamatori Italiani).

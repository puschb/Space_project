Columbia/STS-58 is due for launch on Oct 14.

Mir
---

The Expedition 14 crew of Vasiliy Tsibliev and Aleksandr Serebrov 
continue in orbit aboard the Mir complex. On their Sep 16 and Sep 20
spacewalks they installed a boom called Ripana on the station;
experiments will be mounted on the boom. On the third spacewalk they
were intending to carry out a detailed photo survey of the station's
exterior but Tsibliev's spacesuit overheated, and the spacewalk was cut
short after only 1 hr 55 min. It began at 0052 UT on Sep 28, and the
astronauts did manage to exchange some  exposure sample containers
before the problems arose.


Launches
--------

The Eyesat and Itamsat satellites which went into orbit piggyback with
SPOT 3 are based on the AMSAT-NA Microsat bus. AMSAT-NA is the North
American branch of the Radio  Amateur Satellite organization which took
over in the 1970s from the original Project OSCAR (Orbiting Satellite
Carrying Amateur Radio). Below I give a listing of the satellites which
have used the AMSAT bus; I'm not sure this list is correct and offer it
as a lure for people to send me corrections.

According to John Macagliane's SpaceNews, several of the SPOT 3
piggyback satellites have also received OSCAR numbers. Eyesat carries an
AMRAD amateur radio package which is AMRAD-OSCAR 27; Uribyol 2 is 
KITSAT-OSCAR 25; and ITAMSAT-OSCAR 26 and POSAT-OSCAR 28 round out the
quartet (POSAT's OSCAR number is still provisional). OSCAR 24 has been
reserved for the ARSENE satellite in case it decides to join the OSCAR
system.

The Stella geodetic satellite is a copy of Starlette, a small satellite
launched as primary payload on the first Diamant B P.4 test flight in
1975. They are, roughly speaking, French versions of the Lageos
satellite, with laser retroreflectors to allow precise determination of
the position of the satellite from the ground (or, really, of the
position of the ground relative to the satellite!). The Stella and Starlette
satellites are owned by the French space agency CNES (Centre National
d'Etudes Spatiales) and continue a French involvement in space geodesy
which began early in their space program.

A geostationary satellite was launched from Baykonur on Sep 30. This
was the first launch of the 8K82K Proton launch vehicle since a
failure in May dropped a Gorizont in the drink.

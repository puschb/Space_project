Shuttle  
-------  

OV-102 Columbia landed on runway 22 at Edwards AFB at 1005:43 UTC on Nov
1 after 14 days and 12 minutes in space, the longest Shuttle flight to
date. After 15 flights it has clocked up 2945 h 31 min, the most of any
orbiter. 50-yr old Dr. Shannon Wells Lucid now has the most flight hours
of any active NASA astronaut (838:51 over 4 flights compared to John
Blaha's 789 hr, Bonnie Dunbar's 761 hr, and Rhea Seddon's 722 hr) and is
the most experienced woman space traveller to date. Shannon Wells was
born in Shanghai, China of American parents.

Endeavour was rolled out to pad 39A for the HST Servicing Mission on Oct 28.
Launch is due for Dec 1. 

Mir
---

Progress M-20 docked with Mir on Oct 13 at 2324 UTC. Cosmonauts
Tsibliev and Serebrov made a brief 38 min spacewalk on Oct 22; Serebrov
became the first person to make 9 full spacewalks. The NASA astronaut
Charles Conrad worked under depressurized conditions 10 times, but
two of those were equipment dumps which only lasted a few minutes
and didn't involve the astronaut leaving the spacecraft, and a third
involved disassembly of a docking probe within the spacecraft. Although
in each case the spacecraft was open to vacuum and the astronauts were
only protected by their spacesuits, these are not normally included
in lists of spacewalks. The recordholder for time spacewalking
is Sergey Krikalyov, with 36 h 30 m over 7 occasions; US record is
Gene Cernan with 25 h 24 m over 7 occasions. Serebrov has
27h 40m over 9 walks, some relatively brief.


Launches
--------

The Chinese Jian Bing satellite's reentry vehicle fired its
deorbit motor successfully but, alas, in the wrong direction; the capsule
ended up in a 187 x 3016 km orbit, starting from a low 196 x 251 km
orbit.

The first Intelsat VII satellite, Intelsat 701, was launched on Oct 22.
INTELSAT is an intergovernmental consortium which operates the main
global civil communications satellite network; Intelsat I (better known
as Early Bird) was launched in 1965 and Intelsat 701 is the 49th
Intelsat to be launched. The Intelsat VII series uses the Ford Aerospace
(now Space Systems/Loral) FS-1300 satellite bus, which is derived from
the earlier Intelsat V and Japan's Superbird. The larger Intelsat VI
satellites which continue to provide the  main transoceanic capacity use
the Hughes HS389 bus. 

The Proton launch vehicle chalked up another successful flight
on Oct 28, the second since its May launch failure. It orbited
a Gorizont communications satellite.

Another Delta 2 launch went up on Oct 26 with a Navstar navigation
satellite.

Kosmos-2265, launched on Oct 26, is in a 291 x 1573 km x 82.9 deg
orbit. These orbital parameters are unusual for a Kosmos satellite
but it is probably a small radar calibration or electronic intelligence
satellite.

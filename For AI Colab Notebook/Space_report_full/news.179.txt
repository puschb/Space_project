Shuttle  
-------  

Discovery has been moved to the VAB and mated to the external tank
for mission STS-60. Launch is due for Feb 3.
 
Mir
---

Transport spaceship Soyuz TM-18 was launched on Jan 8 from Baykonur
(planned launch time was 1008 UTC)  carrying the EO-15 crew, callsign
'Derbent'. Crew commander is  Viktor Afanas'ev of the Russian Air Force
cosmonaut  corps; flight engineer is  Yuriy Usachyov of the NPO Energia
cosmonaut corps; the third member of the crew is Dr. Valeriy Polyakov,
head of the IMBP (Institute of Medical-Biological Problems)
physician-cosmonaut team. Polyakov, a cosmonaut since 1972, has made one
flight in space to date, a 240-day tour of duty as Medic-researcher
("vrach-issledotvatel'") on the EO-3 expedition in 1988-89. The only
other IMBP team member to have flown is Oleg At'kov, who was
Cosmonaut-researcher ("kosmonavt-issledovatel'") on the Soyuz T-10
(EO-3) expedition to Salyut-7 in 1984. I don't know what Poyakov's title
on this mission is yet. Afanas'ev has also flown in space before, as
commander of the EO-8 expedition to Mir in 1990-1991. 

The EO-14 crew of Vasiliy Tsibliev and Aleksandr Serebrov are preparing
to return to Earth after a week-long handover period. Afanas'ev and
Usachyov will stay on the station for six months, and will be replaced
by a joint Russian-Kazakh crew. If all goes according to plan, Polyakov
will stay on Mir until mid 1995, setting a new space endurance record.

Launches
--------

Two comsats were launched on Dec 18 by Ariane from Kourou in
Guiane. DBS 1 is a Hughes HS-601 satellite owned by DirecTV,
itself a Hughes subsidiary. The satellite has 16 Ku-band transponders
and will beam a high power TV signal to small rooftop home
receivers in the US. The satellite will be used by DirecTV
and USSB (US Satellite Broadcasting).

Thaicom 1, the other Ariane payload, is another Hughes satellite,
of the older HS-376 type. It is owned by Shinawatra Computer Co,
of Bangkok, and operated by them for the Thai Ministry
of Transport and Communications. It is a hybrid comsat with 
10 C-band and 2 Ku-band transponders.

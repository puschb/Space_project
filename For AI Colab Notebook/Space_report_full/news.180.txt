Shuttle  
-------  

The STS-60 stack with orbiter OV-103 Discovery was moved to
pad 39A on Jan 10.  Launch is due for Feb 3. Payloads
are the Wake Shield Facility free flyer satellite, the
Spacehab 2 commercial lab module, and a GAS Bridge Assembly (GBA)
carrying Getaway Special canisters. These include cans containing
the ODERACS and BREMSAT microsatellites. ODERACS was carried
into space in 1992 but its ejection mechanism failed; it consists
of six small spheres which will be used to calibrate space
debris tracking systems. 

The crew of STS-60 includes five NASA astronauts and one
Russian astronaut.
Commander: Charles Bolden (three flights already, including
pilot of HST deployment and commander of ATLAS-1 Spacelab mission.)
Pilot: Kenneth Reightler (first flight)
Mission Specialists: Franklin Chang-Diaz (three flights to date), 
Jan Davis (one flight), and Ron Sega (rookie).
Payload Specialist: Sergey Krikalyov, engineer-cosmonaut of NPO Energiya,
the "last Soviet citizen" who was aboard Mir during the fall of the USSR.

Meanwhile, crew members have been assigned to the STS-66 and STS-67
missions scheduled later this year. Donald McMonagle will command
STS-66, the first astronaut of the 1987 group to get a command. Stephen
Oswald will command the STS-67 Astro-2 mission. The assignments of
Curtis Brown as STS-66 pilot and William Gregory as pilot on STS-67
means that all of the 1990 group now have flight slots and all of the
1987 group now have assignments to their second flight.
 
Mir
---

Soyuz TM-18 was launched at 1005 UTC on Jan 8 and docked at the Kvant
module on Jan 10 at 1115. The EO-14 crew landed at 0818 UTC on Jan 14 in
the Soyuz TM-17 spaceship. The EO-14 expedition lasted 196 days 18hr 45
m, the 7th longest spaceflight. Aleksandr Serebrov has now spent over a
year in space on 4 flights; he is one of 8 people to have accumulated
more than a year of spaceflight time.

Vladimir Polyakov is now the Mir resident physician, and is on his
second flight to Mir. He will pass the cumulative one year mark on April
12 (the 33rd anniversary of Gagarin's flight). Romanenko's 1987 record
will be beaten on Jul 17, Krikalyov's 1992 cumulative duration will be
passed on Aug 18, and the all time cumulative record of Musa Manarov
(541 days, set in 1991) will be passed on Nov 4. The current record for
a single flight set by Manarov and Titov in 1988 will be passed on Jan 9
next year.

The other two members of the EO-15 crew, Viktor Afanas'ev and
Yuriy Usachyov, are schedule to land in early July and will be
replaced by cosmonauts Malenchenko and Musabaev, neither of
whom has flown before.


Launches
--------

A Molniya-1T communications satellite was launched on Dec 22 from
Plesetsk. The Molniya-1 class satellites are built by NPO
Prikladnoi Mekhaniki of Krasnoyarsk, and are used for Russian 
government and military communications. The 8K78M Molniya 
launch vehicle places the payload and fourth stage in a low parking
orbit; after a partial orbit, the fourth stage ignites to place
the payload in a highly elliptical orbit with a 12 hour period. An
on-board engine on the satellite is used for precise maintenance
of the orbital period.

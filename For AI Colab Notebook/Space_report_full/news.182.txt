Shuttle  
-------  

Mission STS-60 is still scheduled for Feb 3, carrying the Wake Shield
Facility, the GAS Bridge Assembly, and the Spacehab-2 module.
The external tank and solid rocket boosters for STS-62 have been 
assembled in the VAB; that mission is due for early March.
 
Mir
---

The Progress M-21 cargo craft was launched on Jan 28, to carry supplies
to the EO-15 crew of Viktor Afanas'ev, Yuriy Usachyov and Vladimir
Polyakov. The Progress M cargo carriers are robot ships based on the
Soyuz spaceship design, but with the descent module replaced by
fuel tanks and the orbital module stuffed with water, food, mail,
and new equipment for the station. Progress M-21 was due to dock
on Jan 30 with the Mir station.

Launches
--------

Four of the five launches so far this year have been Russian ones.
Gals 1 is the first of a series of direct TV broadcasting satellites,
built by NPO-PM of Krasnoyarsk. The Meteor-3 satellite launched on
Jan 25 is a weather satellite built by VNII-EM for the Russian
Hydrometeorological Service. It carries the French SCARAB
Earth radiation budget experiment. The Ukrainian-built Tsiklon
launch vehicle also carried a small 40 kg subsatellite, TUBSAT-B.
TUBSAT-B was built for the German space agency DARA by the
Technische Universitat Berlin (Technical University of Berlin).
The satellites are in an 1187 x 1208 km x 82.6 deg orbit.

The Clementine 1 (formally Deep Space Program Sensor Experiment or
DSPSE) probe was launched into a 255 x 299 x 67.0 deg Earth orbit on Jan
25. The attached Star 37 kick motor was due to fire in early February to
send it on a trip to the Moon; if the burn is successful, it will be the
first lunar or planetary probe to be launched from the Vandenberg AFB
site in California. The launch vehicle was a recycled Titan II ICBM, and
the spacecraft was built by the Naval Research Lab for the Ballistic
Missile Defense Organization (BMDO, formerly SDIO - "Star Wars"). The
idea is to test infrared and ultraviolet sensors after exposing them to
the  space environment. Clementine is scheduled to map the Moon and then
go on to fly past minor planet (1620) Geographos.

Errata:

  1993-35A was a Molniya-1T, not a Molniya-3 as reported in JSR 181.
  There is still some confusion as to the exact designations of the
  small satellites launched with SPOT 3.
  Krikalyov is designated a Mission Specialist rather than just a
  Payload Specialist on the STS-60 crew (JSR 180).

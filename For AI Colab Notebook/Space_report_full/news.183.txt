Kudos to Vladimir Agapov, Yoshiro Yamada, Kelly Beatty and Joel Runes for
info provided for this week's issue.

Shuttle  
-------  

Discovery was launched at 1210 UTC on Feb 3. The Wake Shield Facility
was grappled by the robot RMS arm and unberthed, but after several days
of problem solving failed to resolve attitude control system failures
on the satellite and it was replaced in the cargo bay. Several GaAs 
semiconductor growth experiments were conducted while the WSF was exposed
to space on the end of the RMS. Discovery was observed from Porter
Square, Cambridge, MA at 1055 UTC on Feb 7 by your somnolent correspondent.

Columbia was moved to the VAB on Feb 3 and joined to the external tank
and solid rocket boosters. It will be rolled out to pad 39 this week.
 
Mir
---

Progress M-21 docked with Mir at 0356 on Jan 30. Reports indicate
that the collision of Soyuz TM-17 with Mir was due to some kind
of engine control problem; Tsibliev was attempting to brake the
spacecraft, and telemetry indicated the engines were firing, but
there was apparently no corresponding trajectory change. Communications
transcripts suggest that the two cosmonauts, particularly the flight
engineer who was observing from the spaceship's orbital module, became
quite alarmed. ("She canna take it, Cap'n!" - oh no, that was another
ship, wasn't it..:-)). The current crew of Mir are Viktor Afanas'ev,
Yuriy Usachyov, and Valeriy Polyakov. 

Launches
--------

I forgot to report last week on the launch failure of an Ariane rocket!
Ariane V63 was launched at 2137 on Jan 24. During the burn of the H10+
third stage, a turbopump failed and the engine shut down prematurely. It
and the two payloads impacted the Atlantic ocean off West Africa. Both
payloads were Aerospatiale Spacebus 2000 comsats; the first was Turksat
1 for the government of Turkey, and the second was Eutelsat II F-5, a TV
satellite for the European Telecommunications Satellite Organization.

The Clementine space probe is on its way to the Moon. The Star 37 apogee
motor fired on Feb 3 at 0628 UTC, placing the probe in a 168 x 128095 km
orbit inclined 66.8 deg to the Earth's equator. After two Earth gravity
assists, it is due to reach lunar orbit on Feb 21.

This week saw the first launches of two important launch vehicles.
The H-II is the new large launch vehicle developed by NASDA,
the National Space Development Agency of Japan. The first H-II
was launched at 2220 UTC on Feb 3 from the Yoshinobu complex
at Tanegashima Space Center. At 2233 the LE-5A second stage engine
completed its first burn, and the OREX Orbital Reentry Experiment
spacecraft was inserted into a 448 x 458 km x 30.50 deg orbit.
At 2245 the LE-5A ignited again and at 2248 delivered the VEP satellite
(Vehicle Evaluation Payload) to a 468 x 36078 km x 28.5 deg geostationary
transfer orbit. VEP was renamed Myouzyou ("Morning/evening star") 
after orbit insertion. I don't know if OREX got renamed.
At around 0001 UTC on Feb 4, the OREX fired its
hydrazine deorbit motor and at around 0030 it splashed down near
Christmas Island in the Pacific Ocean. OREX carried experimental
thermal tiles designed for NASDA's proposed HOPE spaceplane.
With the reentry of OREX, Japan becomes the fourth nation 
after the US, Russia, and China to return a spacecraft from orbit.

On Feb 7, after many delays, the first Titan 401 vehicle was
launched from Cape Canaveral. The Titan 401 is the Titan IV variant
with a Centaur upper stage, and is the most powerful unpiloted launch
vehicle built in the US. As of this writing the Centaur had completed
its second burn and remained attached to the Milstar DFS 1 comsat
in geostationary transfer orbit; a third burn was due to place Centaur
and Milstar in geostationary orbit. Launch was at 2147 UTC, and Centaur
burns 1 and 2 were at 2156 and 2253.

Shuttle  
-------  

Space Shuttle Columbia was launched at 1153 UTC on Mar 4 and reached
a 80 x 285 km transfer orbit about 8 minutes later, with the OMS-2
circularization burn expected around the time I write this. The
cargo bay contains the EDO extended duration orbiter pallet (on its
third mission) and three MPESS cross-bay pallets, two for the 
US Materials Payload-2 and one for the OAST-2 technology payload.
Five GAS Beam Adapter (GABA) plates are installed on the cargo
bay walls, carrying the Dexterous End Effector magnetic 'hand' for
the RMS arm, three GAS cans for the LDCE materials exposure experiment,
and two GAS cans for the SSBUV ozone monitoring experiment.
It's unusual for Columbia to carry the RMS arm, this is only the third
time in nine post-Challenger flights it has done so; the one on board
is probably arm 301, originally belonging to Discovery.
  
 
Launches
--------

The first of two Koronas solar physics satellites was launched from the
Russian spaceport of Plesetsk on Mar 2. The Koronas program is managed
by the Russian RKA space agency (probably by the IKI science institute),
but the AUOS-SM satellite bus and its 11K68 Tsiklon launch vehicle were
built by the Ukranian company NPO Yuzhnoe. The program had been
threatened with delay because of problems between Russia and the
Ukraine, and was originally scheduled for launch in late 1992. The
Koronas-I payload was developed by the IZMIRAN institute (Institute of 
Terrestrial Magnetism in Moscow) and includes the Terek
spectroheliometer, the RES-K solar x-ray spectrograph, the Helikon solar
gamma ray detector, the SUVR-SP-C ultraviolet radiometer, the DIFOS
optical photometer, and other instruments. Koronas-F, developed by FIAN,
the Lebedev Physical Institute, carries a similar set of  instruments.
Koronas is in a 487 x 527 km x 82.5 deg orbit.

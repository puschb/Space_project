Apologies to Internet readers for the interruption in posting
these reports, which was due to my inability to use our 
`improved' newsgroup software. Back issues are available from

Shuttle  
-------  

The Columbia continues in orbit on mission STS-62; the orbit was lowered
slightly on Mar 14. The USMP-2 and OAST-2 primary payloads are
functioning well. Meanwhile, Endeavour is being prepared for its next
mission, STS-59, and was rolled over to the VAB on Mar 14 where it will
be joined to the external tank.
 
Launches
--------

The first launch of Orbital Sciences Corp.'s Taurus rocket was 
successfully carried out on March 13. Payloads for the mission were the
P90-5 satellite and Ball's DARPASAT small satellite. The 204 kg DARPASAT
will carry out advanced technology demonstrations for the Advanced
Research Projects Agency. The 500 kg (?) P90-5 is  operated by the USAF
Phillips Lab as part of the Space Test Program. Also known as TAOS
(Technology for Autonomous Operations Survivability) and STEP 0 (Space
Technology Experiments Program), it carries autonomous navigation
systems and a GPS receiver, in an attempt to reduce the need for ground
controllers. The planned orbit was 520 x 520 km x 105 deg.   Taurus was
launched from a new pad at Vandenberg which doesn't have a designation
yet; I believe it to be in North Vandenberg near the old 576/BMRS/ABRES
Atlas launch pads. If any readers have been to Vandenberg and know where
the pad is relative to any of the other launch complexes, please get in
touch! (VAFB PAO has no clue about this.)

The first Taurus used a TU-903 first stage rocket (from the 
Peacekeeper ICBM), and Orion 50S, Orion 50 and Orion 38 second,
third and fourth stage rocket motors (from the first, second
and third stages of Pegasus). Future Taurus launches will use
the new Castor 120 first stage instead.

NASA's latest tether experiment was launched on March 10 at 0340 UTC as
a secondary payload on a USAF Navstar GPS navigation satellite launch.
The SEDS (Small Expendable Deployer System) 2 is a package attached to
the Delta second stage rocket, which is in a 347 x 352 km x 34.9 deg
orbit. At 0445 UT the package deployed a 20 km tether to compare actual
tether dynamics with theoretical models. Early reports indicate the 23
kg end mass behaved as expected, and unreeled in 1 h 48 min, to a
maximum length of 19.8 km. Control algorithms developed at the Center
for Astrophysics (plug!) were used to ensure a stable deployment, with
the enormous 'pendulum' swinging with an amplitude of less than 4
degrees. Unlike SEDS 1, when the tether was severed after deploy, on
this mission the tether remains attached to the Delta rocket. The
end mass mini-satellite transmitted for 10 hours. The SEDS 2 tether
is visible from the ground by the naked eye (for those at more
fortunate latitudes - hope it's visible from Arizona next week
while I'm there!). The success of SEDS 2 confirms that tether systems
can be used to deploy sensors which require a particular orientation
to the local vertical, such as atmospheric composition experiments.
(Thanks to Enrico Lorenzini for some of these details).

Dean Bakeris of NRL has kindly provided more info on the Clementine
probe. The lunar orbit insertion burn happened at 1251 UTC on Feb 19 and
lasted for 6 minutes; a day later, at 1242 UTC on Feb 20 a second burn
was used to reach the operational orbit. It turns out that the orbit I
reported last week for NRL's Clementine probe was from the center of the
Moon rather than heights above the lunar surface. In the latter, more
conventional description, that orbit would be 433 x 2920 km x 89.3 deg.
The new elements provided by Dean imply an orbit of 401 x 2952 km x 89.7
deg assuming a 1738 km lunar radius.

 The ISA (Interstage Adapter) satellite launched with
Clementine remains in highly eccentric Earth orbit. It carries 
a set of space environment experiments.

I'm away from home so forgive me if I've missed any major news
items! 

Shuttle  
-------  

Columbia landed at 1409 UTC  Mar 18 on RW33 at Kennedy Space Center,
after a mission lasting 13d 23h 16m 17s, less than an hour short
of the record set by the same orbiter on mission STS-58. Columbia
now has 3280 hr 47 min of flight time in 16 flights (compare its
nearest rival Discovery with only 2828 hr in 18 flights.) Marsha
Ivins now has 787 h 32 m of flight time over 3 flights, making her
the second most experienced woman astronaut.

Endeavour was rolled out to pad 39A on Mar 19. Its STS-59
mission will carry the SIR-C and X-SAR imaging radars
(probably on one or two Spacelab pallets),
and two MPESS cross bay experiment trusses. One will hold
the MAPS air pollution experiment, and the other will be
a GAS Bridge Assembly holding three GAS canisters. GAS
Bridge flights normally carry 8 to 12 GAS canisters.
The CONCAP IV materials exposure experiment is another GAS can
attached to an adapter plate on the payload bay wall.
 
Mir
---

A new cargo ship was launched to Mir on Mar 22. Progress M-22
(serial 11F615A55 no 222) was launched into a 192 x 238 x 51.6 km
orbit and will dock with the Mir complex in a few days. Deorbiting
of Progress M-21 is expected on Mar 23. Reports indicate that
the launch vehicle was probably the 11A511U variant rather than 
the 11A511U2 variant normally used for Soyuz-TM and Progress-M.

Launches
--------

The Taurus launch was from complex 576-E at Vandenberg.
576-E was used for four Atlas F ICBM test launches in 1962-64, including
the first Atlas F test from the west coast, and was then mothballed.
Taurus used a new concrete pad on the same site.
Thanks to all those who identified the site for me.
According to an OSC press release, the 500 kg P90-5 satellite was
injected into a ~ 540 x 555 km orbit inclined 105 deg. Two-line
elements have not been released yet.

Reports indicate that the SEDS 2 end mass has now separated
from the tether, presumably due to an impact of some kind.

A Yantar' class spy satellite was launched into a 67 degree
inclination orbit on Mar 17 and given the code name Kosmos-2274.
The spacecraft, built by the Central Specialized Design Bureau
of Samara, Russia, returns film from orbit using capsules and
a large descent vehicle. The first Yantar' type satellite was
flown in 1974; it has now entirely replaced the old Zenit
spy satellites based on the original Vostok spaceship.

Jonathan's Space Report 
No. 191       1994 Apr 7
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Not much news this week, but a few amplifications of earlier stories.
A drought of launches continues, but STS-59 is due tomorrow.

Shuttle  
-------  

Launch of Endeavour and the Space Radar Lab 1 is due for April 8. The
press kit on Spacelink for STS-59 is wrong about the layout of the
payload bay - there is no GAS Bridge. The cargo bay contains the
following:

  MPESS Mission Peculiar Experiment Support Structure, carrying the
    MAPS (Measurement of Air Pollution From Satellites) experiment
  SL-PLT Spacelab pallet              ) Carrying SRL-1, Space Radar Lab
  ATS (2) Antenna Trunnion Structures )  with SIR-C and X-SAR radars
  GABA   Gas Beam Adapter, carrying CONCAP-IV GAS can payload on
         bay 4-Port.
  GABA   Gas Beam Adapter, carrying G-203 GAS can on bay 4-Starboard.
  GABA   Gas Beam Adapter, carrying G-458 GAS can and GBP-1 ballast payload 
         on bay 13-Port.
  GABA   Gas Beam Adapter, carrying G-300 GAS can on bay 13-Starboard.
  RMS    Remote Manipulator System RMS-303, on its 7th flight.
  PSA    Provisions Stowage Assembly (emergency EVA tools)

Thanks to all those who spotted the deliberate mistake :-), Mission
Specialist Richard Clifford flew on STS-53, so is not a rookie as I
claimed. 

The Astro-2 mission has been delayed from Dec 1994 to Jan 1995
and switched to a different orbiter, as Columbia is to be sent
for its next maintainance period several months early.
 
Mir
---

The flight of the EO-15 crew continues aboard Mir. Soyuz TM-18
originally docked with the TsM-E (Kvant) module on Jan 10, but
on Jan 21 it redocked with the PkhO section docking port on the
main Mir module (source: Novosti Kosmonavtiki). Progress M-21,
and now Progress M-22, therefore used the TsM-E port. The current
station configuration is therefore:
   "Mir" base block DOS    17KS-12701
   "Kvant"          TsM-E  37Ke-010      docked at Mir AO rear port
   "Kvant-2"        TsM-D  77KSD-17101   docked at Mir PkhO side port
   "Kristall"       TsM-T  77KST-17201   docked at Mir PkhO side port
   "Soyuz TM-18"    7K-STM 11F732-67?    docked at Mir PkhO front port
   "Progress M-22"  7K-TGM 11F615A55-222 docked at TsM-E rear port
(7K is the official internal program name for the Soyuz program;
TsM means specialized module, DOS is an abbreviation for long-term
orbital station). 

Space Probes
------------

Magellan lowered its orbit around Venus with orbit trim maneuvers on Mar
10 to lower periapsis, resulting in a 184 x 530 km orbit. More burns
were made on Apr 4 and Apr 5, and further trims are due Apr 11 and Apr
12. The target orbit is 220 x 390 km.

Clementine 1 made orbit trim burns on Mar 25 and Mar 26 to change
the latitude of its perilune from 30 deg S to 30 deg N, improving
mapping coverage of the northern hemisphere. Clementine will depart
lunar orbit in May.

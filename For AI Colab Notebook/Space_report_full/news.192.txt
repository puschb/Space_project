Shuttle  
-------  

Space Shuttle Endeavour lifted off at 1105 UTC on Apr 9 from pad 39A.
The STS-59 stack used solid motors RSRM-37 and external tank ET-63
attached to orbiter OV-105. Endeavour reached orbit at 1113 UTC. On Apr
11 its orbit was 211 x 226 km x 57.0 deg. Operations with the Space
Radar Lab were successful; landing was originally due for Apr 19 but was
delayed until Apr 20 for weather and switched to Cailfornia. Endeavour
fired its deorbit engines at 1600 UTC. Entry interface was at
1622, with main gear touchdown on runway 22 at Edwards AFB at 1654.30
UTC for  a mission duration of 11 days 5 hr 49 min. The next Shuttle
flight is STS-65, a long duration International Microgravity Lab flight
with orbiter Columbia.

LAUNCHES
--------

A cluster of 3 Uragan ("Hurricane") navigation satellites were launched
on Apr 11 by an 8K82K Proton-K launch vehicle from Baykonur cosmodrome
in Kazakhstan. The cluster was inserted into low earth orbit attached to
the Blok-DM2 (11S861) upper stage, which then separated from the 8S812
third stage (1994-21B) and the Blok-DM2 fairing (1994-21C), both of
which reentered the same day. The Blok-DM2 ignited twice to enter first
a transfer orbit and  then (after separation of two ullage motors) a
circular orbit at 19000 km altitude and 65 degrees inclination. The
three Uragan satellites, built by NPO Prikladnoi Mekhaniki of
Krasnoyarsk, then separated from the Blok-DM2. They were given the post-launch
names Kosmos-2275, Kosmos-2276 and Kosmos-2277. The Uragan satellites form
part of the GLONASS system which is the Russian analog of the Navstar
Global Positioning System.

The first of a new series of GOES-NEXT weather satellites was launched
from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on Apr 13. The Atlas Centaur AC-73
launch vehicle successfully delivered GOES-I (GOES 8 after launch) to a
geostationary transfer orbit. A liquid apogee motor (probably  a
Marquardt R4D, does anyone know for sure?) will be used to circularize
the orbit. The first burn of the motor on Apr 15 was cut short early
after unexpectedly high temperatures, leaving it in a 988 x 42653 km x
23.6 deg transfer orbit; further orbit raising burns are expected soon.
The GOES NEXT series of satellites are being built by Space
Systems/Loral (formerly Ford Aerospace, formerly Aeronutronic Ford);
there were a lot of problems developing GOES I's sensors and the
satellite is way late and over the originally planned budget. GOES
(pronounced as in "how goes it?") stands for Geostationary Operational
Environmental Satellite; do not confuse GOES with GEOS (a frequent
mispelling - there have been two series of GEOS satellites, one by NASA
and one by ESA, but they have nothing to do with GOES). GOES satellites
are operated by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
(NOAA), and originated as NASA's SMS (Synchronous Meteorological
Satellite) project. The GOES class satellites launched to date are as
follows:

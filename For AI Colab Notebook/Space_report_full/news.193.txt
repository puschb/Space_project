Editorial

I receive a number of inquiries from readers who see this newsletter on
bulletin boards about direct email subscriptions. To be added to the
mailing list, just send me a message telling me that you want to be sent
JSR. (As I am a human, not a mail exploder, please  do not just send a
one-word 'subscribe' command!). Back issues of JSR are available by FTP
from sao-ftp.harvard.edu in directory pub/jcm/space/news. For real fans,
I note that extensive archaelogical research among some 9-track tapes
has turned up JSR 1 to 31 which were previously missing from the
archive.


Shuttle  
-------  

Endeavour has been mated to the Boeing 747 Shuttle Carrier Aircraft
at Edwards AFB, but as of Apr 29 remained unable to depart for
Florida because of bad weather.

The next Shuttle mission is STS-65, scheduled for July. Orbiter
OV-102 Columbia will carry a Spacelab long module on the
International Microgravity Lab 2 flight. SRB stacking continues
for the mission in the Vehicle Assembly Building.

LAUNCHES
--------

Three Kosmos satellites were launched this week for the Russian
Ministry of Defense. Kosmos-2278 is a heavy electronic intelligence
satellite which was placed in an 800 km high orbit at an inclination of
71 degrees. The launch used a large Zenit booster; both satellite and
booster were made by NPO Yuzhnoe of the Ukraine, and the launch was from
the Baykonur spaceport in Kazakhstan.

Kosmos-2279 is a navigation satellite in the Parus ('sail') series,
built by NPO Prikladnoi Mekhaniki. The Parus satellites are analogous to
the US Navy Transit spacecraft and are placed in 1000 km high orbits at
an inclination of 83 degrees. Kosmos-2279 replaces Kosmos-2180, launched
in 1992. The first Parus spacecraft was Kosmos-700, launched in 1974. A
more advanced version with civilian applications, called Tsikada, is
also launched into similar orbits. 

Kosmos-2280 is an advanced imaging reconnaissance satellite, probably
an improved variant of the Yantar' series. It was launched into a
187 x 264 km orbit with an inclination of 70 degrees; it is expected
to manoeuvre to a more circular orbit within one day and remain operational
for six months to a year.

Maxim Tarasenko communicates an amplification to my report on the GLONASS
Uragan satellites: "NPO Prikladnoi mekhaniki of Krasnoyarsk-26 is a lead
contractor for the WHOLE  "Glonass" system. Uragan satellites are
DESIGNED JOINTLY by NPO PM and AKO  Polyot of Omsk (AKO is for AeroSpace
Association - "AeroKosmicheskoye  Ob'edineniye"). MANUFACTURING of the
satellites is performed by AKO Polyot."

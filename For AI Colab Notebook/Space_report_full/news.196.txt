MIR
---

The Progress M-22 cargo ship fired its engine around May 15 to raise the
orbit of the Mir orbital station from 381 x 400 km to 398 x 399 km.
Maxim Tarasenko reports that the launch of the replacement cargo ship,
Progress M-23, is now due on May 22.

LAUNCHES
--------

Disaster befell the Clementine 1 probe on May 7. The on board
computer erroneously told the attitude control system to fire
its thrusters and depleted the attitude control propellant tanks.
Although the main propulsion system still has fuel, controllers
can't point the engine in the right direction so that's not much
help. The flight to (1620) Geographos and to (3551) 1983RD
(not unnumbered as claimed in JSR195, sorry Gareth!) appears impossible. 
Clementine did successfully complete its lunar mapping mission and
the sensors are still operational. It is currently in a highly
elliptical orbit around the Earth. The Ballistic Missile Defense
Organization manages the Clementine project and the Naval Research
Lab built and operates the spacecraft.

Launch of the USAF Rome Lab's P91-A (STEP 2) satellite was aborted just
before launch last week. Problems were noticed in the Pegasus booster as
the B-52 carrier aircraft was flying above the Point Arguello Warning
Area launch site over the Pacific. The B-52 returned to Edwards AFB with
the Pegasus still attached. I don't know if a new launch date has yet
been set. STEP 2 carries SIDEX, a signal indentification experiment.

The ALEXIS EUV astronomy satellite was launched on a Pegasus flight last
year. Damage during launch meant that controllers didn't know which way
the satellite was pointing. The Los Alamos science team and the Aero
Astro Inc manufacturers have now come up with a way to determine the
satellite's orientation, which has enabled them to make the first useful
sky picture from the satellite's data. The picture shows the Moon and
the soft x-ray source HZ 43. HZ 43 is a white dwarf star from the
Humason-Zwicky catalog and was the first EUV galactic source identified,
during the Apollo-Soyuz misison in 1975. The new picture means that there's
a very good chance the rest of the data obtained by Alexis over the last
year will eventually be usable.


Information Wanted
------------------

Trivia question of the week: can anyone find out for me what solid
motor was used to raise the orbit of the German IRM satellite,
launched in 1984 as part of the AMPTE project?

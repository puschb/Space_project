MIR
---

Progress M-23 was launched May 22 from Baykonur toward the Mir station.
The older Progress M-22 cargo ferry was deorbited on May 23. Progress
cargo ships are based on the Soyuz transport spaceship design, but
carry a fuel section instead of the cosmonaut descent module. They supply
water, air, food and fuel as well as carry new experiments and equipment
for the crew. Progress M-23 is scheduled to dock at the port on the
rear of the Kvant TKM-E astrophysical module.

LAUNCHES
--------

Launch of the USAF Rome Lab's P91-A (STEP 2) satellite was successfully
carried out on May 19. The B-52 carrier aircraft took off from RW4/22 at
Edwards AFB and flew out to the Point Arguello Warning Area over the
Pacific. The Orbital Sciences Corp. Pegasus was dropped at 1703 UTC and
all three stages fired placing the payload in orbit. However, the orbit
achieved was only 603 x 832 km x 82 deg instead of the planned 833 km
circular orbit. The low perigee is not a huge disaster, the old Scout
did the same thing a number of times and had the flights counted as
successes, and most missions would not be seriously affected by this
sort of anomaly. However, the next Pegasus launch will most likely be
delayed until the cause of the malfunction is understood and fixed. STEP
2 was built by TRW and is probably a lightsat in the Eagle series. It will
study propagation of radio signals through the ionosphere. This Pegasus
was the fifth of the winged boosters to be launched; all have reached orbit
although the second one was only partially successful.

Another Gorizont communications satellite for the US company
Rimsat of Ft. Wayne, Indiana was orbited on May 19 by Proton from Baykonur.
It will be placed over Eastern Asia at 142.5 deg E. The spacecraft
is probably owned by AO Informkosmos, a Russian company in which Rimsat
is a major holder; it is leased by Rimsat.  The satellite, built by
NPO Prikladnoi Mekhaniki of Krasnoyarsk, has both C and Ku band transponders.
The first Rimsat Gorizont was launched in November 1993. The first Soviet
Gorizont satellite was launched in 1978; the series is soon to be replaced by an
improved spacecraft called Express.


Information Wanted
------------------

This week's JSR Irregulars' Gold Medal goes to Bart de Pontieu (MPE),
Kelly Beatty (Sky & Tel),  and Mark Shaffer (BAe) for giving me info on
the IRM kick motor. The AMPTE (Active Magnetospheric Particle Tracer
Explorers) launch was a complicated one; three
spacecraft were placed in geostationary transfer orbit by a three-stage
Delta rocket. The Johns Hopkins APL-built CCE satellite separated and
fired its Star 13 rocket to move to a lower inclination orbit. The IRM
satellite, built by the German Max Planck MPE group, then fired its
Hercules BE-3 motor to raise its apogee to more than 100 000 km. Finally
the British UKS satellite separated from IRM (UKS didn't have propulsion
of its own). The IRM satellite created three 'artifical comets' by
releasing lithium and barium into the magnetosphere.

The BE-3 "Alcyone" rocket has an interesting history, it was originally the
retro-rocket used to try and land the Block II Ranger probes on the
Moon in 1962. It was used on the Vela satellites as an apogee motor,
as the third stage of the Redstone/SPARTA rocket used to launch
Australia's first satellite WRESAT in 1967, and as the fifth
stage of the Scout E-1 launch vehicle, used only once in 1974 to
launch the Hawkeye satellite. This comes to a total of 27 flights that
I am aware of, any more examples gratefully received.

That question was so successful I'm going to try another fishing
expedition. Does anyone have any information on the Redstone rockets
launched in 1966/1967 from San Nicolas Island, CA as part of the US
Army's Project Defender? I know there was at least one launch in Nov
1966. The Redstone was the rocket that launched Alan Shepard, and I have
(partial) details on all its flights except for these Defender launches.
Even the History Office at Redstone Arsenal had no record of them. Anyone
with details on the launches from Fort Wingate, please get in touch too,
as my info on these is pretty sketchy. I have records of 101 Redstone
launches in all so far.

Shuttle
-------

OV-104 Atlantis has returned to Florida after modifications at Rockwell's
Palmdale, California plant. The 747 Shuttle Carrier Aircraft flew from
Palmdale to Biggs AAF, El Paso, TX on May 27; from Biggs to
Warner-Robbins AFB, Macon, GA on May 28; and on to the Shuttle Landing
Facility at KSC on May 29. During the refurbishment, OV-104 was modified
to support the Mir docking module. Atlantis is now in  Orbiter
Processing Facility Bay 3; Discovery vacated that slot and is being
garaged in the Vehicle Assembly Building until Columbia's processing is
complete (around Jun 10); Discovery will then take that parking spot.

Summary of forthcoming missions:
Jul     OV-102 Columbia STS-65, carrying Spacelab Long Module (International 
         Microgravity Lab 2) and Extended Duration Orbiter pallet (4th flight).
Aug     OV-105 Endeavour STS-68, carrying Spacelab Pallet (Shuttle Radar Lab 2) and 
         MPESS pallet (MAPS air pollution monitor)
Sep     OV-103 Discovery STS-64, carrying Spacelab Pallet (Lidar In-Space Techology 
         Experiment), and MPESS pallet with Spartan-201 free flyer.
Oct     OV-104 Atlantis STS-66, carrying Spacelab Igloo and Pallet (ATLAS-3), and
         Astro-SPAS free flyer (CRISTA).

Columbia's crew consists of six NASA astronauts and the third Japanese
space traveller, Dr. Chiaki Naito Mukai, who will become the first
Japanese woman in space.

MIR
---

Progress M-23 docked with the Mir complex at 0618 UTC on May 24.

Viktor Afanas'ev and Yuriy Usachyov, will be replaced next
month by the EO-16 crew, Yuriy Malenchenko and Talgat Musabaev,
who will be launched on the Soyuz TM-19 ferry ship on Jun 20.
Physician-cosmonaut Valeriy Polyakov will remain aboard Mir.
Both Malenchenko, a Russian Air Force cosmonaut, and Musabaev,
a Kazakh Space Agency cosmonaut, will be on their first flights.

LAUNCHES
--------

Pegasus update: the fifth Pegasus flight on May 19 used a four stage
version of Pegasus, not the three stage one as I implied last week.
The HAPS (Hydrazine Auxiliary Propulsion System) fourth stage 
has flown once before, on the second Pegasus fight. The first three
Pegasus stages fired successfully, and Orbital Sciences is 
investigating the cause of STEP Mission 2's low perigee. It may have
been a guidance problem or a malfunction in the HAPS burn; the problem
occurred out of telemetry range so it's not immediately clear what happened.

Russian Space Forces launched a three stage Tsiklon-3 from Plesetsk on May
25, but a problem seems to have occurred during separation of the second
stage from the S5M third stage, and the vehicle and its payload impacted
in the Arctic. The payload was referred to as Kosmos-2281, but it is not
clear if it will keep this codename - launch failures have never yet been
given Kosmos names. The Ukranian Yangel design bureau (now NPO
Yuzhnoe) converted the R-36M ICBM (known in the West as the SS-9 Scarp)
to a two stage space launcher called Tsiklon-2. (Tsiklon-1 was a
cancelled project using the R-16 ICBM). Tsiklon-2 first flew in the late
1960s, and in 1977 the S5M third stage was added to make the Tsiklon-3,
which is now the standard light launch vehicle used by the Russians.

Information Wanted
------------------

Well, I have no takers so far on my Redstone/Defender question. This week's
questions:
1) Who can tell me which 747 was used on Atlantis' cross country trip?
(Rick A, are you there?)
2) Can anyone tell me ANYTHING about the MG-18 (also known as M-2)
rocket used as the fourth stage of the Scout X-2M variant?
3) What propulsion system is used by the SPOT 1, 2, 3 satellites, and
who builds it?

Jonathan's Space Report (2)

I've included all the more boring launches so you have some background
info...

Space Shuttle Discovery was moved to Pad 39B at the Kennedy Space
Center last week. Repairs to the main engines are continuing
and the launch is scheduled for March 10. If launch
is not possible by March 18, the mission will be cancelled to
allow Atlantis to launch the Magellan Venus probe instead.

The Soviet satellite Kosmos-1990, launched January 12, is on a
mission to take photographs of earthquake-stricken Armenia. 
The photographs will be used to help the reconstruction effort.
The satellite is operated by the Priroda Center, part of the
USSR Central Geodesy and Cartography Agency (GUGK).

The first Israeli satellite, Offeq-1, burned up in the Earth's
atmosphere on January 14. It was launched last year.

Shuttle
-------

Launch of STS-65 is due on July 8 from pad 39A into a 28 degree orbit.
The cargo bay of Columbia contains a Spacelab Long Module and the
Extended Duration Orbiter pallet. Crew are Robert Cabana (Commander), 
James Halsell (Pilot), Richard Hieb (Payload Commander), Carl Walz,
Leroy Chiao, and Donald Thomas (Mission Specialists), and Dr. Chiaki
Mukai (Payload Specialist), a NASDA astronaut. The International
Microgravity Laboratory-2 contains  experiments from NASA, the European
Space Agency and its member national  space agencies, and the National
Space Development Agency (NASDA) of Japan. Dr. Mukai will become the
first Japanese woman to fly in space.


LAUNCHES
--------

General Dynamics successfully launched an Atlas I Centaur from pad 36B
at Cape Canaveral on Jun 24. The AC-76 flight placed a Hughes HS-601
communications satellite in geostationary transfer orbit. The satellite,
UHF Follow-On F3, is operated by Hughes for the United States Navy. This
marks seven successful flights in a  row for Atlas, following some
problems in 1991-93. The next Atlas launch is due on July 28, with
DirecTV 2.  [Thanks to Al Hegemann for info].

  Here  is a log of recent Atlas launches. There have been 519 Atlas 
launches since 1957. (Atlas I first stages have 5000-series tail
numbers; Atlas II's have 8100-series tail numbers, but I don't have the
numbers for most of the recent flights).

Shuttle Processing Status Explanation (or,  what are all these acronyms
anyway?):

 The Shuttle consists of an Orbiter (OV), an expendable External Tank
(ET), and a reusable pair of Redesigned Solid Rocket Motors (RSRM), also
known as Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs).  The OV is prepared for flight in
the Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF) which consists of three bays (one
of which is actually a separate building) after which it is towed to the
Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) and `mated to the stack' or joined to
the ET and RSRM. First, the segments of the RSRM are stacked up on a
Mobile Launch Platform (ML) and then the ET is connected to it. After
the OV is mated, a Crawler-Transporter is moved underneath the ML and
carries the ML/RSRM/ET/OV stack to one of the two pads (A or B) at
launch complex 39 (LC39) where it is eventually launched on a Space
Transportation System (STS) mission. Occasionally an OV is returned to
the Rockwell International plant in Palmdale, California for refit - an
Orbiter Maintenance Down Period or OMDP.

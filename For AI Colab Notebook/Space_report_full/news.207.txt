Shuttle
-------

Launch of STS-68 is still scheduled for Aug 18 with the Space Radar Lab
payload. Crew are Capt. Michael Baker, USN (Commander), Maj. Terry Wilcutt,
USMC (Pilot), Dr. Tom Jones, NASA (Payload Commander, MS4), Steve Smith,
NASA (Mission Specialist 1), Cdr. Dan Bursch, USN (Mission Specialist 2),
Dr. Jeff Wisoff, NASA (Mission Specialist 3). Smith and Wilcutt are making
their first flights.

Discovery was rolled over to the VAB for stacking with the External
Tank and Solid Rocket Boosters on Aug 11. It is due for launch
on Sep 9 on mission STS-64.

Launches
--------

Ariane V66 was launched at 2305 on Aug 10. Payloads were a Hughes HS376W
satellite, Brasilsat B1, and an Aerospatiale Spacebus 2000 satellite,
Turksat 1B. Brasilsat B1 carries a solid Thiokol Star 30 apogee motor,
which makes a single burn to geosynchronous altitude. Turksat 1B has an
MBB S400 liquid apogee engine, and will make several burns to raise its
altitude from transfer orbit.

Brasilsat B1 is the first of Brazil's second generation communications
satellites, replacing the Embratel agency's Brasilsat S1 and S2,
launched in 1985 and 1986 by Ariane. Those satellites were an earlier
version of the HS376 model. Brasilsat B1 is the first 'widebody' HS376,
3.6m in diameter compared to 2.2m for all earlier HS376 satellites,  and
is the 40th HS376 to be launched by my count. It carries 28 C-band
transponders for the Telebras television organization and, reportedly, a
single military X-band transponder.

Turksat 1B should become Turkey's first successful comsat. Turksat 1A was lost
in an Ariane launch failure earlier this year. Turksat will be delivered
to the Turkish Ministry of Posts and Communications once it reaches
its final  orbit. It has 16 55W Ku-band transponders.

Kosmos-2286, launched on Aug 5, is a missile early warning satellite in the Oko
("Eye") series. It carries a large telescope to detect ballistic missile launches.
The spacecraft and upper stage were placed in low earth orbit at an inclination
of 62.8 deg to the equator; the upper stage then ignited to place the Oko
in a high elliptical orbit with a 12 hour orbital period. The Oko's on board
engine refines the orbit to be exactly semi-synchronous, with alternate passes
over the same longitude.

Kosmos-2287, Kosmos-2288, Kosmos-2289, launched on Aug 11, are Uragan-class
GLONASS navigation satellites, the Russian equivalent of the Navstar Global
Positioning System. They operate in orbits at an altitude of 19000 km.

Note: The intended apogee for APEX was in fact 2500 km (very close to the
acheived 2551 km), not 2000 km as I stated in JSR206. Congratulations
to Orbital Sciences on a successful mission.

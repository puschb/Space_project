Some catching up to do now I'm back from vacation:

Shuttle
-------

The attempted launch of STS-68 was terminated with an RSLS Abort at
1053:58 UTC on Aug 18. The High Pressure Oxidizer Turbopump temperature
on the third main engine, SSME 2032, registered high after the engine
started up and the launch was cancelled at T-2 seconds. This is the
closest to launch that a Shuttle flight has ever been aborted.
Endeavour was rolled back to the VAB on Aug 24 and its main engines are
being replaced. The new target launch date is October 2.

Discovery was rolled out to pad 39B a few hours after Endeavour's abort
on pad 39A. Its STS-64 mission is still scheduled to be launched on Sep 9.

Launches
--------

A Molniya-3 communications satellite was launched on Aug 24 into
a 600 x 39000 km orbit inclined 62.8 deg.

The Progress M-24 cargo ship was launched from Baykonur on Aug 25.
It is scheduled to dock with Mir, but the first attempt at docking
on Aug 27 was unsuccessful.

Titan Centaur TC-11 was launched from Cape Canaveral on Aug 27. 
The payload is possibly another Advanced JUMPSEAT type electronic
intelligence satellite. I hope to have more details on this launch
in the next issue.

The second H-II launch vehicle, TF-2, successfully orbited its Kiku-6
(Engineering Test Satellite VI) payload on Aug 28. The H-II is
the Japanese NASDA agency's heavy lift launch vehicle. Kiku-6
carries the first Japanese made liquid propellant apogee engine,
which will place the satellite in geostationary orbit and then
separate (nevertheless, it is considered part of the payload rather
than a third stage of the launch vehicle).
The satellite, to be stationed at 153.8 deg E, is to test technology
for 2-tonne class 3-axis stabilized comsats.
It carries a nickel-hydrogen battery, and a small ion
engine for north-south station keeping.
The 3.0 x 2.0 x 2.8 m box shaped satellite has 
solar panels spanning 30m, and 
3.5 and 2.5 m diameter antennae for fixed
and mobile communications, together with K and S-band
antennae for intersatellite communications
as well as a laser communications experiment. Mass is about 1800 kg.

Thanks to Vladimir Agapov, Joel Runes, and Al Hegemann for info
in this issue. Any errors, as usual, are mine.

Shuttle
-------

Endeavour landed at 1702:09 UT on 1994 Oct 11 on runway 22 at Edwards AFB.
STS-68 mission duration was 11 days 5 hours 46 min 9 sec.

Columbia left Ellington AFB, Texas on Oct 11 aboard the SCA 905 en route
to Palmdale, CA via El Paso. It flew over Edwards AFB while Endeavour
was on the runway. At the Rockwell International plant in Palmdale it
will begin an Orbiter Maintenance Down Period. It is to return to flight
in mid 1995.

Mir
---

Soyuz TM-20 docked with Mir at 0028 on 1994 Oct 6.
The Soyuz TM is an 11F732 spacecraft, probably serial number 69. 
I believe that Soyuz TM-20 is docked with the forward Mir port
and Soyuz TM-19 is docked at the rear Kvant port (can someone
confirm this?)

The current crew aboard Mir consists of Yuriy Malenchenko, Aleksandr
Viktorenko, and Talgat Musabaev of the Russian Air Force cosmonaut
corps, Elena Kondakova of NPO Energiya, Valeriy Polyakov of the
Institute for Biological-Medical Problems, and Ulf Merbold of the
European Space Agency. With the six Shuttle astronauts in orbit
last week, there were 12 people in space, which equals the all time
record.

Recent Launches
---------------

Intelsat 703 was launched on Oct 6 at 0635:02 UT by Atlas Centaur
AC-111.  The satellite is a 3-axis stabilized Space Systems/Loral
FS-1300 with 26 C-band and 10 Ku-band transponders and will serve the
Pacific Ocean region. The Martin Marietta Atlas IIAS Centaur delivered
the satellite into a geostationary transfer orbit. Since the
Atlas IIAS is a relatively new launch vehicle, I thought
I'd record a detailed description of the launch profile, based
on information provided by Al Hegemann. The MA-5A main engine
and two of the four Castor IVA solid rocket boosters ignited at liftoff;
the other two solids ignited at 0636:02. The first two solids were
jettisoned at 0636:14 and the second two at 0636:57. The MA-5A
propulsion system on the Atlas consists of two booster engines and a
central sustainer engine. At 0637:47 the booster engines were shut down,
and at 0637:50 the tail section of the Atlas IIA fell away leaving the
main sustainer engine exposed. At 0638:31 the payload fairing around the
Intelsat payload was discarded - AC-111 was now high enough that
aerodynamic protection was not needed. The Atlas sustainer cut off at
0639:53 and the Atlas IIA stage separated onto its suborbital trajectory
at 0639:55. Intelsat 703 was now attached to the AC-111 Centaur IIA. At
0640:17 the two RL-10-4A liquid hydrogen/liquid oxygen engines on the
Centaur ignited and burned until 0645:17. The combination was now in a
parking orbit. After a coast period, AC-111 reignited at 0659:29. It
shut off at 0701:12, and separated from Intelsat 703 at  0703:22.
Intelsat 703 was now in a 283 x 38575 km x 25.9 deg orbit. The apogee
was higher than initially expected and will let the satellite save fuel
on reaching its final orbit. Over the next few days it fired its R4D
liquid apogee engine to enter first a 7598 x 38540 km x 11.2 deg orbit
(Oct 9) and then a 35670 x 38552 km x 0.2 deg orbit (Oct 11). This final
orbit is a little higher than geostationary; on Oct 11 at 1815 UT the
satellite was over 138 deg East and drifting 16 degrees per day.


An Ariane 44L was launched on Oct 8. The rocket placed two
communications satellites in orbit: Solidaridad 2, and Thaicom 2. Both
satellites are built by Hughes. Solidaridad is a 3-axis stabilized HS601
satellite for the Mexican government communications agency,
Telecomunicaciones de Mexico. Thaicom 2 is an HS376 spin-stabilized
satellite  for Shinawatra Satellite Public Co. of Bangkok. 
The initial orbit for Thaicom 2 was 277 x 36165 km x 3.9 deg.
Thaicom 2 fired its Thiokol Star 30 solid apogee motor on Oct 10 and
entered a 33964 x 36208 km x 0.00 deg orbit, drifting at 9 deg per day
eastward over the Indian Ocean. By Oct 11, Solidaridad 2's
ARC490N liquid engine had raised its orbit to 15922 x 36146 km x 0.8 deg

Okean-O1 no. 7 was launched on Oct 11 into a 631 x 666 km x 82.5 deg 
orbit. The satellite, built by NPO Yuzhnoe, has a mass of 1950 kg. It
carries instruments for studying the ocean surface, probably including
side-looking radar. A more advanced Okean is under development for
launch on the Zenit rocket. This Okean was launched on a Tsiklon launch
vehicle with an S5M upper stage. Earlier Okean-O1 spacecraft were launched
on 1986 Jul 29, 1987 Jul 16, 1988 Jul 5, 1990 Feb 28, and 1991 Jun 4.

Magellan carried out the Termination Experiment on Oct 11,
firing its thrusters at 1321 to descend into the atmosphere of Venus.
It will burn up today or tomorrow.

Shuttle
-------

Atlantis took from pad 39B at 1659:43 UT on Nov 3, with main engine
cutoff at 1708 UT. STS-66 payloads are the Spacelab ATLAS 3 (Igloo plus
pallet), the ASTRO-SPAS carrier with CRISTA, and three GAS beam adapters
with SSBUV (the Shuttle solar backscatter Ultraviolet spectrometer),
ESCAPE II (a solar spectrometer), and ITEPC (a radiation dosimeter). The
expected orbit was 295 x 311 km x 57.0 deg. Crew are Donald McMonagle,
Curtis Brown, Ellen Ochoa, Joe Tanner, Scott Parazynski, and ESA's
Jean-Francois Clervoy, a French citizen. Since ESA's Ulf Merbold is
still aboard Mir, this marks the first time that two ESA astronauts have
been in space at the same time.

Mir
---

Malenchenko, Musabaev and Merbold undocked from the rear port of Mir at 
1030 UT on Nov 3 and flew out to a distance of 190m. They then engaged
the automatic docking mode and came back in to the same docking port
with redocking at 1105. This was a special test of the automatic docking
system after recent failures. The three cosmonauts are now back on Mir,
but will land tomorrow, leaving the rear port free for the next
Progress cargo freighter. Viktorenko, Kondakova and Polyakov will remain
on the station which is currently in a 393 x 395 km x 51.7 deg orbit.
[Thanks to Jim Oberg for passing on details of the redocking].

There's been some confusion lately about which spaceship used
which docking port on Mir. Here is a table giving my understanding -
please send corrections if you disagree. The two ports in regular
use are the rear port on Kvant and the PKhO port on the nose
of Mir.

Recent Launches
---------------

NASA-Goddard's Wind space science satellite was launched on Nov 1. The 
McDonnell Douglas Delta 7925-10 rocket entered a 186 x 3038 km x 28.7
deg orbit, and the PAM-D third stage ignited to plance Wind in a lunar
transfer orbit. Wind carries a set of instruments to study the solar
wind, as well as two gamma ray burst detectors. It was built by Martin
Marietta Astro Space. Wind will fly past the Moon, study the outer
magnetosphere, and eventually be placed in a `halo orbit' around
the L1 Lagrange point between the Earth and the Sun.

The long awaited Russian geostationary meteorological satellite
was launched on Oct 31. Elektro, built by VNII ElektroMekhaniki,
flew into orbit aboard a Proton. On Nov 2, Elektro was in a
1441.65 min, 35858 x 35931 km x 1.3 deg orbit over 88.4 deg E,
drifiting 1.4 degrees west per day.

Nov 1 also saw the launch of another Hughes HS601 communications
satellite. The Ariane V69 flight placed Astra 1D in a 217 x 31006 km x
7.0 deg geostationary transfer orbit. Astra 1D is a television satellite
for the Luxembourg-based Societe Europeene des Satellites (SES). 

Kosmos-2293, launched on Nov 2, is an Electronic Intelligence Ocean
Reconnaissance Satellite (EORSAT), operated by the Russian Ministry of Defence
for naval intelligence. It was placed in a 403 x 417 km x 65.0 deg orbit.

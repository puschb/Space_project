Erratum
-------

Thanks to Pawel Moskalik for pointing out that the previous
single-mission duration record for a woman was held by Chiaki
Mukai of Japan, not Seddon and Lucid of the US.

Shuttle
-------

Atlantis carried out a new type of rendezvous on Nov 12, the plus R bar 
approach. R-bar is the radius vector of the target satellite (in
Earth-centered spherical polar coordinates), while V-bar is the velocity
vector of the satellite (almost parallel to the tangential - theta -
vector in the orbit plane since low orbits are all roughly circular).
Usually the Shuttle gets to the right value of R but a greater Theta and
brakes to let the target catch up - a V-bar approach. In the R-bar
approach the Shuttle gets to about the right Theta but a smaller value
of R, with velocity adjusted so that its slightly elliptical orbit will
carry it outward to the correct R value without any further thruster
firings. This approach minimizes thruster effluent contamination of the
target. (Rendezvous gurus, correct me if I have any of this wrong).

The rendezvous with CRISTA-SPAS was completed early on Nov 12 and the
satellite was grappled with the RMS arm at 1305 UT. It was berthed in
the payload bay by 1650 UT. The deorbit burn was carried out at 1431 UT
on Nov 14, with main gear touchdown on Edwards runway 22 at 1533:45UT.
Wheels stop was at 1534:34. The 16cm icicle produced from waste water
dumps survived reentry and landing, according to the KSC Shuttle Status
Report. Atlantis will return to KSC next week to begin preparation for
its next mission, the first Mir docking.

Mir
---

Progress M-25 docked with Mir at the rear Kvant port at 0904 on Nov 13.
It will be replaced in February with Progress M-26. The next crew,
aboard Soyuz TM-21 in March, will include NASA astronaut Norman
Thagard. Plans for 1995 include the completion of the Mir complex
with the docking of the Priroda and Spektr modules.

Recent Launches
---------------

The Resurs-O1 earth observation satellite is in a 660 x 663 km x 98.0
deg orbit. It carries the German Safir-R1 communications experiment as a
secondary attached payload.

There are three imaging recon satellites currently in orbit
operated by the GRU (Central Intelligence Agency) of the MO RF
(Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation):
 Kosmos-2267, launched 1993 Nov  5 by Soyuz-U, 
              current orbit  236 x 299 km x 70.4 deg
 Kosmos-2280, launched 1994 Apr 28 by Soyuz-U, 
              current orbit 232 x 269 km x 70.4 deg
 Kosmos-2290, launched 1994 Aug 26 by Zenit, 
              current orbit 206 x 359 km x 64.8 deg.
Kosmos-2267 and Kosmos-2280 are the 17th and 18th satellites in
the advanced series which has replaced the older Yantar' class satellites.
The first of the series was Kosmos-1426 in 1982, and Kosmos-2267 just
exceeded the record 372-day lifetime of its predecessor Kosmos-2223.
Kosmos-2290 is the first of a new series launched by Zenit. Its orbit
is similar to the five satellites in the Soyuz-launched Kosmos-2031 series.

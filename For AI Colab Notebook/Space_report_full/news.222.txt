Clarifications
--------------

The loss of the H-10-III stage on Ariane V70 was due to
a gas generator failing to reach full thrust. The component
is reportedly the same as the one on the usual H-10+ stage.
(Space News, Aviation Week).

The Orion Systems' Orion 1 satellite was built by a part of
British Aerospace that now belongs to Matra Marconi Space -
I apologize for the error, it's tough work keeping up
with all these corporate realignments. By Dec 4, Orion 1 was
in a 35500 x 122584 km x 1.3 deg orbit.


Mir
---

On Dec 4 the Mir complex was in a 391 x 395 km x 51.6 deg orbit. As of
Dec 9, Commander Aleksandr Viktorenko and Flight Engineer Yelena
Kondakova have been in orbit for 66 days as part of the 17th main
expedition (EO-17 crew). The station doctor, Valeriy Polyakov, came
aboard in January as part of the EO-15 crew and has been in orbit for
335 days, longer than any other spaceflight except one (the
Titov/Manarov flight in 1987/88). His cumulative time in space over 2
missions is 576 days, a world record. At present, the Mir complex
consists of:
 The Mir core module
 The Kvant astrophysics module, docked to the Mir rear port
 The Kvant-2 airlock module, docked to a side port at Mir's transfer (front)
             compartment
 The Kristall technological module, docked to a side port of the transfer compt.
 The Soyuz TM-20 transport spaceship, docked to the front port of the 
             transfer compartment.
 The Progress M-25 robot cargo freighter, docked to the Kvant module's rear port.
 The Raduga 10 reentry capsule, carried in the Progress cargo compartment.

Shuttle
-------

Discovery is being prepared for its 20th flight into space. Crew of
Mission STS-63 will be James Wetherbee (commander), Eileen Collins
(pilot), Michael Foale, Janice Voss, and Bernard Harris (mission
specialists), and Vladimir Titov (Russian Space Agency).  In the payload
bay will be the RMS robot arm, the pressurized Spacehab 3 module,
together with the Spacelab Tunnel Adapter and the Spacehab
transition/flex section which connects the tunnel to the module, an
MPESS (Multi purpose Experiment Support Structure) truss in its Spartan
Flight Support Structure (SFSS) variant, and a second MPESS truss. The
first MPESS will carry the Spartan-204 free flyer satellite, which will
be deployed and retrieved during the mission using the RMS arm.
Spartan-204 carries detectors to study the solar wind. The second MPESS
(probably the Hitchhiker-M variety) will carry a modified Getaway
Special (GAS) canister which will eject six ODERACS-2 radar calibration
satellites, as well as the Cyro Systems and GLO-II payloads. The TCS/DTO
700-5 laser rendezvous experiment package will be attached to the
payload bay wall (with a GABA adapter plate?) Discovery will carry out a
rendezvous with the Mir complex (experiment DTO-835). Two crew members
will carry out a spacewalk, one of a series used to train astronauts and
test out new spacewalking techniques (DTO-1210, 671, 672, 833).  Launch
of STS-63 is due on Feb 2.

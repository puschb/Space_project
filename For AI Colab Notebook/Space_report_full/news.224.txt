Close Call
----------

Minor planet 1994 XM1, a five-meter rock discovered by the Spacewatch
telescope on Dec 9, passed within about 100000 km of Earth at 1900 UT on
Dec 9. Orbit of 1994 XM1 is about 0.9 x 3.1 AU inclined at 5.6 deg to
the ecliptic. (It came within lunar orbit, so I figure that makes it
fair game for this newsletter :-)

Shuttle
-------

NASA has selected a new group of astronauts, its 15th since the Original
Seven. The 19 new astronauts include ten pilots and nine mission
specialists; five women and 14 men; 6 civilian and 13 military. The
pilots include only two test pilots from Edwards Air Force Base, USAF
Majs. Michael Bloomfield and Pamela Melroy (whom I believe to be the
first Wellesley graduate to be an astronaut), and one from the Navy's
Pax River test pilot base, USMC Capt. Frederick Sturckow. Two other USAF
test pilots in the group are Maj. Steven Lindsey of Eglin AFB and Maj.
Rick Husband, currently on an exchange leading RAF Tornado flight test 
at Boscome Down (near Stonehenge). LtCdr Joe Edwards, USN, is currently
assigned to the Joint Staff at the Pentagon. The remaining four pilots
are Lt Scott Altman, USN (Fighter Sqn 31, San Diego); Cdr Jeffrey Ashby,
USN (CO of Fighter Sqn 94, near Fresno); Cdr Dominic Gorie, USN, F/A-18
pilot at Strike Fighter Sqn 106, near Jacksonville); and Lt Susan Still,
USN, F-14 pilot from Fighter Sqn 101 at Virginia Beach.

The three military mission specialists are Maj Michael Anderson, USAF,
of Plattsburgh AFB, NY; Lt. Robert Curbeam, Jr., USN, an instructor at
Annapolis; and Maj. Carlos Noriega, USMC, based at Okinawa. The civilian
mission specialists are Dr. Kalpana Chawla from Overset  Methods Inc,
Los Altos, CA, who has a PhD in aerospace engineering from the Univ. of
Colorado; Kathryn Hire, a Shuttle processing engineer from Lockheed
Space Ops. Co. at KSC; Dr. Janet Kavandi, an engineer from Boeing with a
PhD in chemistry from the U. of Washington;  Dr Edward Lu, an astronomy
postdoc at Hawaii, with a PhD in physics from Stanford; and Dr. Stephen
Robinson, a research at NASA-Langley with a PhD in mechanical engineering 
from Stanford.

This selection seems to mark a trend away from the practice of hiring
JSC mission controllers and other Shuttle program insiders as mission
specialists, but the biggest change is the high fraction of pilots in
this group, the first time since 1969 that NASA has selected a group
which is mostly pilot astronauts, perhaps making up for the last
selection in which only four of 19 were pilots. From Mar 1995 to Mar
1996 the new group will be 'ascans', astronaut candidates in training,
after which they will start to be assigned to missions.

The astronauts selected in the late 1960s had to wait many years to get
a flight (18 to 19 years in the cases of Don Lind, Karl Henize and Tony
England, who finally flew in 1985), but recent groups have fared much
better - the last two of the 1990 group are scheduled to have flown by
March, and the 1987 group had all flown by 1992. The 1992 group has
begun to fly, with all but four in training for missions slated for
1995. 

Meanwhile, one of the Apollo veterans has passed away: Stuart Roosa,
CM Pilot for Apollo 14, died of pancreatitis on Dec 12 in Washington, DC.
Col. Roosa, a former Edwards test pilot and a member of the 1966 astronaut
group, left NASA in 1976.

Mir
---

On Dec 19 the Mir complex was in a 390 x 394 km x 51.6 deg orbit. As of
Dec 20, Commander Aleksandr Viktorenko and Flight Engineer Yelena
Kondakova have been in orbit for 77 days as part of the 17th main
expedition (EO-17 crew). The station doctor, Valeriy Polyakov, has been
in orbit for 346 days, and his record cumulative time in space over 2
missions is 587 days. Soyuz TM-20 and Progress M-25 remain docked to
the station. Jim Oberg reports that Soyuz TM-20 is due to undock and
redock in early January in a test of the automatic docking system.

Recent Launches
---------------

A Russian Al'tair class tracking and data relay satellite was launched
from Baykonur on Dec 16. The satellite was named Luch ("Beam"). 
The three previous Al'tair satellites were:
 Kosmos-1700   1985 Oct 25
 Kosmos-1897   1987 Nov 26
 Kosmos-2054   1989 Dec 27
The launch is the 12th launch of Proton so far this year, with one
more expected.

Kosmos-2298 was launched from Plesetsk on Dec 20 into a 785 x 810 km x 74.0
deg orbit. Satellites are launched into this orbit at the rate of about
one a year; Kosmos-2298 is the 48th to reach orbit since Kosmos-372 in
1970. Western analysts have suggested that the series are communications
satellites for sensitive military or intelligence communications.

Mir
---

On Dec 26 the Mir complex was in a 390 x 393 km x 51.6 deg orbit.
The EO-17 crew of Viktorenko, Kondakova and Polyakov continue
their mission.

Shuttle
-------

1995 will see Phase I of ISSA (International Space Station Alpha):
the joint flights of Shuttle and Mir. The first few Shuttle/Mir flights are:
  STS-63 (Feb):  Adapter, Transition, Spacehab, Spartan    (Rendezvous only)
  STS-71 (May):  Adapter, Tunnel, Docking Assembly, Spacelab Long Module
  STS-74 (Oct):  Adapter?, Docking Assembly, ?
  STS-76 ('96):  Adapter?, Transition, Spacehab.
Later flights will see docking missions involving Spacehab
modules instead of Spacelab. I'm a little confused about the
exact configuration of the hardware in the payload bay for 
STS-74 and later Mir docking flights, so if anyone has a good description,
please pass it on! My *impression* from what little I have read is that
the APDA (Androgynous Peripheral Docking Assembly) will be mounted on
the Spacelab Tunnel Adapter for STS-71, but on STS-74 it will be left on
the Kristall module at Mir and later flights will just carry the
Spacelab Tunnel Adapter, which will dock directly to the APDA on
Kristall.  Clarification will hopefully be forthcoming.

Errata
-------

Ta to Russell Eberst for pointing out that the RAF test base should be
spelt Boscombe Down. Thanks also to Mark Matossian for catching another
slip - the 63.4 degree critical inclination I discussed in the piece on
Molniya stops the advance of perigee around the orbit, not the
longitudinal precession of the orbital plane as I loosely implied.

New Launches
------------

A new launch vehicle, the Rokot, made its debut on Dec 26. The first two
stages of Rokot are the RS-18 ICBM (known in the West as the SS-19, and
developed from the Chelomei bureau's original UR-100 missile). Rokot
carries a new Briz third stage, which entered orbit with the RS-15
amateur radio satellite. The 1-m diameter, 70 kg payload uses a similar
bus to the RS-3 to RS-8 satellites, and ended up in a 1884 x 2165 km x
64.8 deg orbit. Two suborbital tests of Rokot were carried out on 1990 
Nov 20 and 1991 Dec 20. 1994 saw the first successful  launch of four
new launch vehicles: Japan's H-II, the US Taurus, India's PSLV and
Russia's Rokot, and several upgraded ones: the US Titan 4 Centaur, 
China's Chang Zheng-3A, and the US Pegasus XL (which failed).

Martin Marietta's Titan 4 number K-14 was launched from pad 40 at Cape
Canaveral on Dec 22. The vehicle was a Titan 402 model with an Inertial
Upper Stage (IUS), and placed a TRW Defense Support Program satellite
into geostationary orbit. DSP F17 carries a wide field infrared
telescope to provide real-time warning of missile launches. It is the
fourth advanced DSP to be launched; two others went up on Titan and
another on the Shuttle. The Titan 4 places the DSP/IUS in low parking
orbit; the SRM-1 IUS first stage goes to geostationary  transfer orbit;
and finally the SRM-2 fires to place itself and the DSP in
near-synchronous orbit, eliminating the need for an internal apogee
engine. This was the 4th Titan 4 mission this year, and the 11th
since 1989; one launch in 1993 was a failure.

(Thanks to Lt. Archer of Patrick AFB Public Affairs for the
Titan serial number. Serial number F17 of the DSP is conjectural;
the last three were F14, 15 and 16.)

Six small communications satellites were launched by a Ukranian-built
Tsiklon-3 launch vehicle on Dec 26 into 1400 x 1415 km x 82.5 deg
orbits. Kosmos-2299 to Kosmos-2304 will supplement the Russian Defense
Ministry's store-dump comsat network.

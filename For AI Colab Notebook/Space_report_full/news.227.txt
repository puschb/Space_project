Shuttle
--------

OV-103 Discovery, attached to the STS-63 stack on Mobile Launcher 1, was
moved to Pad 39B on Jan 10. It was transferred to the Vehicle Assembly
Building on Jan 5 (not Feb 5 as I said last week!). Launch of mission
STS-63 remains scheduled for Feb 2.

Mir
---

The Mir crew of Viktorenko, Kondakova and Polyakov boarded
the Soyuz TM-20 ferry craft on Jan 11, and undocked from Mir's
front port at 0900 UTC. The craft withdrew to about two hundred
metres from Mir and then redocked in a test of the automatic
Kurs system, which had failed in Progress M-24's attempted
docking last year. Redocking came at 0925 UTC.

On Jan 8 Valeriy Polyakov passed the one year mark in orbit.
His flight is now the longest ever, beating the 365 day
record of Vladimir Titov and Musa Manarov set in 1988.

New Launches
------------

The German space agency's Experiment Reentry Space System (EXPRESS)
payload was launched on Jan 15 by Mu-3S-II from Kagoshima. The payload
uses a Russian-built reentry vehicle and the launch was carried out by
the Japanese ISAS space agency. It was due to land in the Australian
desert after a five day flight, but a guidance failure on the M-23
second stage of the Mu launch vehicle apparently left the spacecraft and
its final stage in an incorrect orbit; EXPRESS reentered the atmosphere
over the Pacific within a few orbits. This was the 8th Mu-3S-II launch
and the first to have a significant failure. These details are all
provisional, I don't have full information yet. In particular, Yoshiro
Yamada reports that the Mu-3S-II-8 was a four-stage version instead of
the basic three-stage one. The standard Mu-3S-II has a  M-13 first
stage, an M-23 second stage, and an M-3B third stage. Four flights have
used extra solid propellant KM-P, KM-M or KM-D kick motors as fourth
stages.

  Mu launch history:
Mu-4S vehicle:  M-10/M-20/M-30/M-40 configuration.
 First launch 1966 with M-10 live only; 1969 with first three stages live;
 3 of 4 orbital attempts successful 1970-1972.
Mu-3C vehicle : M-10/M-22/M-3A configuration with thrust vector control
 second stage. 
 3 of 4 launches successful, 1974-1979.
Mu-3H vehicle:  M-13/M-22/M-3A configuration.
 3 of 3 successful, 1977-1978, all flown with unidentified fourth stage
 kick motor? (any details welcome)
Mu-3S vehicle:  As Mu-3H but with thrust vector control added to M-13 stage.
 4 of 4 successful, 1980-1984.
Mu-3S-II vehicle: M-13/M-23/M-3B configuration.

An Intelsat 7 satellite was launched by a Martin Marietta Atlas IIAS on
Jan 10. The Atlas first stage (serial no. 8203) and its Castor IV solid
strapons took off from Pad 36 at Cape Canaveral; the Centaur II AC-113
second stage then ignited to enter a 306 x 41000 km x 26.4 deg transfer
orbit. The Space Systems/Loral Intelsat 7 satellite first fired its apogee
engine on Jan 11 and over several days reached geostationary orbit;
the profile is pretty typical for recent comsats with bipropellant engines,
and I include each orbit reached below:
 Jan 10   306 x 41000 km x 26.4 deg
 Jan 11  1353 x 42238 km x 23.4 deg
 Jan 12  4033 x 41128 km x 15.7 deg
 Jan 12 16563 x 41116 km x  4.7 deg
 Jan 14 35787 x 36974 km x  0.2 deg
 Jan 16 35793 x 35809 km x  0.0 deg, 56 deg E drifting 0.2 deg/day
Intelsat satellites are operated by the International Telecommunications
Satellite Organization, an intergovernmental consortium with over
a hundred member nations (the US participation is via Comsat Corporation). 
The first Intelsat satellite was Early Bird, launched in 1965.

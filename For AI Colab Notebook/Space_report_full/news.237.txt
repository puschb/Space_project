Shuttle
-------

Processing of Discovery for STS-70 and Atlantis for STS-71 continues; it
seems likely that STS-70 will fly first because of the delays in the Mir
program. Columbia completed its refit in California and departed
Palmdale on Apr 11 aboard the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft en route to KSC.

Mir
---

Dezhurov, Strekalov and Thagard remain aboard Mir; they had been
in space for 29 days 9 hr 49 min at 1600UTC on Apr 12. Launch of
Progress No. 227 (named Progress M-27 after launch) 
was carried out on Apr 9 at 1934 UTC, and the Progress docked with
the Mir complex on Apr 11 at 2300 UTC.

Apr 12 is the 34th anniversary of the launch of the Vostok spaceship,
when Yuriy A. Gagarin became the first human in space.

Recent Launches
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The newly formed Lockheed Martin carried out its first launch
on Mar 22; the former General Dynamics Commercial Launch Services,
which had become Martin Marietta CLS, is now part of the new
Lockheed Martin empire, and the San Diego (old GD/Convair Space Systems
Division) and Denver (old Martin Marietta Astronautics Titan plant)
operations are to be merged.

Lockheed Martin's Atlas IIAS launch vehicle flight AC-115 (Atlas stage
number 8204) took off from LC36B at Cape Canaveral and placed a Space
Systems/Loral FS-1300 class communications satellite in orbit for
INTELSAT, the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization.
Intelsat 705 will be placed over the Atlantic Ocean. 

The AC-115 launch was swiftly followed by the final Atlas E launch from
Vandenberg on Mar 24, and a further Atlas Centaur launch, this time a
IIA model, from pad 36A at Canaveral on Apr 7. AC-114 (with Atlas first
stage 8111) placed  American Mobile Satellite Corp.'s AMSC-1 into orbit.
AMSC-1 (also known as M-SAT) is a Hughes HS-601 class comsat with 16
L-band and one Ku-band transponders. The satellite is the first to be
optimized for mobile telephone communications. It will be complemented
by a similar M-SAT satellite for Canada's Telesat Mobile Inc., to be
launched later this year.

Orbital Sciences Corp.'s Pegasus launch vehicle returned to flight on
Apr 3. This was the first successful launch using the Lockheed L-1011
carrier airplane, which took off from Vandenberg AFB and dropped the
Pegasus over the Point Arguello Warning Area in the Pacific. The 3-stage
standard Pegasus placed three small satellites in a 730 x 750 km x 70.0
deg orbit. The three satellites all use OSC's new Microstar bus design.
Two of the satellites, Orbcomm FM1 and FM2, are the first satellites in
OSC's  Orbital Communications Corp. (Orbcomm) subsidiary's low Earth
orbit (LEO) communications network. They are 1.0m in diameter and 0.16m
high, with a mass of 40 kg; once on orbit they deploy a 3.3m long
VHF/UHF communications antenna and a pair of solar panels spanning 2.2m.
Orbcomm FM2's uplink antenna was malfunctioning last week, but FM1
was operating well.

The third satellite is Microlab 1, a 68 kg scientific satellite 1.0m in
diameter and 0.3m high. It carries NASA-MSFC's Optical Transient
Detector experiment to study the global distribution of lightning, and
the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research's GPS-MET experiment
 which will study the occultation of GPS navigation satellite signals by
the atmosphere to derive meteorological information. Microlab is owned
by OSC, with NASA and NSF renting the space for and operation of their
experiments.

The Orbcomm program has been shrouded in commercial secrecy, with
few details released on the precursor test payloads:

On Apr 5 Israel launched its most sophisticated satellite to date, the
'Ofeq-3  ("Horizon-3") 3-axis stabilized technology satellite. The
Shaviyt launch vehicle  took off on a westward trajectory from Palamchim
Air Force Base in Israel and placed the satellite and the AUS-51 solid
motor third stage in a retrograde orbit. 'Ofeq-3 carries an
electro-optical scanner and has a mass of 225 kg. It has been reported
in the media as Israel's first spy satellite, but I think this is
probably an overstatement. 'Ofeq-3 should probably be considered as
Israel's first 3-axis-stabilized technology development satellite, with
an experimental imaging system (whose resolution may be as good as a few
metres) intended for both remote sensing and military reconnaissance
applications, but it isn't a full fledged spysat.

'Ofeq-3's westward orbit is rare, but not a record; some US Air Force
satellites in the 1960s went to an inclination of 144 degrees to the
eastward equator (i.e. 36 degrees to the westbound equator). There are
quite a few polar retrograde satellites with inclinations up to around
105 degrees, and the GAMBIT spy satellites used inclinations up to 110
degrees regularly in the 1960s and 1970s. Below I give a table of all
satellites whose inclinations exceeded 110.5 degrees.

Kosmos-2290 was deorbited on Apr 4 from its 180 x 557 km x 64.8 deg
orbit. The reason for the unusual maneuver a week before deorbit
(see JSR 236) remains unclear.

My description of the Start launch vehicle last week was inaccurate;
it differs from Start-1 in that there is a new second stage inserted
between the first and second stages of Start-1. According to Maxim
Tarasenko, apparently there are actually six stages including a small
kick motor to circularize the orbit. The failure was in the fourth
stage, and the fifth stage never got a chance to fire. The debris
impacted eastern Russia.

Happy Plutonic Perihelion!

Soyuz TM-8 was launched from Baykonur on Sep 5 and docked with the Mir
orbital station on Sep 7.  The crew are Aleksandr Viktorenko (Kdr) and
Aleksandr Serebrov (BI, or flight engineer). 

The final Titan 34D was launched on Sep 4 from Cape Canaveral.  AvLeak
prelaunch reports suggested the payload was a pair of DoD comsats (DSCS
II F-16 and DSCS III F-4) with an IUS upper stage, but I have not
managed to confirm this. 

Kosmos-2037, launched Aug 28 by Tsiklon from Plesetsk, is a geodetic
satellite. 

NASDA's Himawari-4/GMS-4 weather satellite was successfully
launched from Tanegashima, Japan by H-I vehicle on Sep 5.

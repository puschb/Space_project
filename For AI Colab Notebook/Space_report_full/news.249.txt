After deployment of TDRS 7, Discovery's crew spent the week carrying out
a variety of in-cabin experiments. The new Mission Control room in
Houston was used to control orbit operations. Meanwhile, the TDRS 7
tracking and data relay satellite deployed by Discovery  is in
geosynchronous orbit approaching its operational position over the
Pacific.

Discovery's payload bay doors were closed in preparation for landing
early on Jul 21, but both KSC landing opportunities were waved off due
to weather, and at 1233 UTC the bay doors were opened once more as the
STS-70 crew prepared for an extra day in orbit. 

On Jul 22 at 1100 UTC the OMS (Orbital Maneuvering System) engines
ignited for a 2 minute 55 second deorbit burn, putting Discovery on
track for a landing at the Kennedy Space Center. The spacecraft touched
down at 1202:00 UTC on runway 33 at Kennedy Space Center. Discovery will
be towed to Orbiter Processing Facility bay 1 and will be prepared for a
ferry flight to Palmdale in California where it will be refurbished at
the Rockwell plant.

One of the RSRM O-rings on the Atlantis STS-71 mission was found to be charred
when the SRM was disassembled; this may be an issue for the date of the
next launch, currently set for Aug 5. This mission, STS-69, will use
orbiter Endeavour and includes the Wake Shield Facility and Spartan
subsatellites as well as the IEH astronomy experiment.

Mir
---

Solov'yov and Budarin carried out their first EVA on Jul 14 at 0356 UTC.
Duration was five hours 34 min. The stuck Spektr solar array has now been
fixed. The Kristall module was redocked
on Jul 17 from the -X axis to the -Z axis. A second spacewalk was
carried out on Jul 19; Ron Baalke's Space Calendar reports that
Solov'yov had problems with his spacesuit and not all the planned work
was carried out, and another EVA was due to be carried out on Jul 21.

Progress M-28 was launched on Jul 20 at 0304 UTC. According to Vladimir
Agapov, the launch mass was 7125 kg. Progress M-28 separated
from the Blok-I third stage at 0313 UTC into a 191 x 258 km x 51.6 deg
orbit. The first two orbital corrections were carried out at 0647 and 0737.
On Jul 22 at 0440, Progress M-28 docked with the -X port on the Mir
orbital complex (info from Agapov).

Corrected durations for the EO-18 crew: 115 days 08 hr 43 m, giving
Dezhurov 2768:43, Strekalov 6454:21, Thagard 3373:27.

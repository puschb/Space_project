Jonathan's Space Report

---------------------------------------------------------------------

The Soyuz TM-8/Mir/Progress M complex continues in orbit, crewed
by Aleksandr Viktorenko and Aleksandr Serebrov.

Atlantis/STS-34/Galileo is scheduled for launch on Oct 12.

Two classified payloads were aboard the Titan 34D launch on Sep 4.
They are probably DSCS communication satellites and are now presumably
in geostationary orbit.

Another classified US satellite was launched on Sep 6. No details yet,
but it's a year since the first Titan II SLV launch from Vandenberg,
so another of those would be a good first guess. Any details, anyone?

Another Resurs-F remote sensing satellite was launched by the USSR
on Sep 6.

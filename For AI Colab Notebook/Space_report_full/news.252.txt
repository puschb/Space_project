Endeavour was rolled back out to launch pad 39A on Aug 8. Repairs
to the SRBs begin this weekend.

Delta no. 228, launched from Cape Canaveral on Aug 5, suffered the first
significant partial failure of a Delta II vehicle (out of 42 launches).
The Delta 7925 model took off from Pad 17B, but it appears that one of
the Hercules GEM strapon solid boosters failed to separate, causing the
first stage to deliver less velocity than planned to the vehicle. The
second stage compensated by burning for 35 seconds longer than planned
on its first burn, which placed the rocket in parking orbit. The second
burn to raise apogee and lower inclination was successful, but the third
burn of the second stage shut down early when fuel ran out. The
satellite and third stage separated from the second stage, and the PAM-D
third stage ignited, placing the satellite in an orbit with an apogee of
only 30000 km instead of 35700 km. The last similar strapon separation
failure was in 1974 during launch of the Westar 1 satellite. Delta has
been a remarkably reliable vehicle; in the last 25 years it has failed
to reach orbit only 3 times in 150 launches, with an additional handful
of partial failures similar to Delta 228.

The payload of Delta 228 is Korea Telecom's Mugunghwa satellite
(informally known to the Western media as Koreasat 1). Mugunghwa is
a Lockheed Martin Astro Space Series 3000 satellite, and has a Star 30
solid apogee motor which will be fired to raise the orbit; Mugunghwa
will need to use some of its hydrazine stationkeeping propellant 
to complete the orbit circularization and make up for the stage 1 
underperformance. Late on Aug 5, Mugunghwa was in a 1371 x 29388 km x 20.6
deg, 532.3 min orbit. The Delta second stage, which was unable to make
its fourth planned burn to depletion after separation since the
fuel was already depleted, is in a 938 x 1373 km x 26.7 deg,
108.5 min orbit. On Aug 10 Mugunghwa fired the Star 30 motor and
entered a 1074.1 min, 26911 x 29817 km x 0.2 deg equatorial orbit.

The Magion 4 satellite has been cataloged as 23646, 1995-39F.
Space Command elements place it in a 760 x 191760 km x 63.3 deg
orbit with a period of 5454.13 minutes.

The IABS apogee stage from the DSCS III Atlas launch has not yet
been cataloged by Space Command.

A Molniya-3 satellite was launched on Aug 9 from Plesetsk. The Russian
Molniya satellites are used for domestic communications from 12-hour
period elliptical orbits inclined at 63 degrees.

Panamsat's PAS 4 satellite raised its orbit to 1203 min, 26461 x 35729 km
x 0.4 deg with burns of its liquid apogee motor on Aug 5 and Aug 6.

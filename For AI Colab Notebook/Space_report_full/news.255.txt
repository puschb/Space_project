Shuttle
-------

Launch date for Endeavour on mission STS-69 has been set for Sep 7
following a scrub on Aug 31 nine hours before launch because of a faulty
fuel cell. Endeavour is on pad 39A.

Meanwhile, Columbia has been moved to launch pad 39B (probably around
Aug 28) from the Vehicle Assembly Building.

Mir
----

The EO-20 crew were launched on Soyuz TM-22 from Baykonur on Sep 3 at
0900:23 UTC. They will spend 135 days in space. Crew commander is Yuriy
Pavlovich Gidzenko of the Russian Air Force. Flight engineer is Sergey
Vasil'evich Avdeev of RKK Energiya, and cosmonaut-researcher is Thomas
Reiter of the European Space Agency. Soyuz TM-22 docked with Mir's front
(-X) port at 1029:54 UT on Sep 5 and the hatch was opened at 1101:23.
The EO-19 crew, Anatoli Solov'yov and Nikolai Budarin, have been on the
station since June's STS-71 mission and will return to Earth in the
Soyuz TM-21 ferry. The Progress M-28 cargo ship probably undocked from
Mir on Sep 4.

Following up my query last week, I now confirm that there was no EVA from Mir
on Aug 18. Sorry about the confusion.

Recent Launches
--------------

The National Space Agency of Ukraine (NKAU) has launched its first
satellite, Sich. Sich is  based on the Okean remote sensing satellites
built by the Ukrainian company NPO Yuzhnoe for the USSR and subsequently
the Russian Space Agency.

Carried into orbit with Sich was the FASat Alfa microsatellite, with
imaging and communications experiments for the Chilean Air Force.
Reports indicate that FASat-Alfa failed to separate from the Sich main
payload. FASat-Alfa uses the Surrey Satellite Technology Uosat bus.

A Kosmos satellite was launched by Proton from Baykonur on  Aug 30 into
geostationary orbit. On Sep 1, Kosmos-2319 was at 89 deg E drifting 1
deg W per day.

JCSAT 3, launched on Aug 29, was placed in an initial orbit of
248 x 80682 km x 23.1 deg, with a period of 1681.65 min.
N-Star a was launched into a standard transfer orbit of 172 x 35775 km x
7.0 deg. On Aug 30 the orbit was raised to 7384 x 35755 km x 3.7 deg and
then again to 34090 x 35732 km x 0.1 deg.
The Mugunghwa-ho (Koreasat) satellite is now  in near-geostationary
orbit; on Aug 31 it was at 116.0E drifting 0.1 deg per day.
Optus B3 is now on station at 156.0E, replacing Optus A3
which is drifting west at 0.2 deg per day; Intelsat VA F13 is at 177.0W;
Brasilsat 2 is at 92.0W.

The Strategic Rocket Forces launched a Topol' ICBM from Plesetsk
at 0750 UT on Sep 5.

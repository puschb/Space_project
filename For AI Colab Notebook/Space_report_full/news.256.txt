Shuttle
-------

Orbiter OV-105 Endeavour was launched at 1509:00 UTC on 1995 Sep 7 from
pad 39A at Kennedy Space Center. The SRBs (RSRM-48) separated at about
1511:03, and the main engines shut down at 1517:33, with separation of
External Tank ET-72 a few seconds later. Endeavour was inserted into a
65 x 365 km x 28.5 deg transfer orbit. The OMS 2 orbit circularization
burn at 1551 UTC was successful, placing Endeavour in a 368 x 377 km x
28.5 deg orbit. Opening of the payload bay doors was planned for around
1630 UTC. Crew of STS-69 are David Walker, Kenneth Cockrell, James Voss,
James Newman and Michael Gernhardt.

The Spartan 201 satellite was grappled by the RMS arm at around 1500 UTC
on Sep 8 and unberthed at 1515 UTC. It was released into orbit at 1543 UTC.
Orbital parameters on Sep 9 were 368 x 376 km x 28.5 deg.
Spartan 201 is built by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. It
carries a Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory ultraviolet
telescope to study the Sun.


Endeavour made re-rendezvous with Spartan 201 on Sep 10 at around 1420 UTC.
However, Spartan appears to have entered safemode and was not in the
expected orientation. Walker and Cockrell flew the Orbiter around
Spartan until the RMS arm was aligned with the grapple fixture on
Spartan, and Gernhardt drove the RMS in to grapple Spartan at 1502 UTC.
The satellite was berthed on the SFSS (Spartan Flight Support Structure)
around 1516 UTC and latched at 1521 UTC. The RMS then released the
satellite by 1524. 

The OMS-3 and OMS-4 burns were scheduled on Sep 10 at 1836 UTC and 1922
UTC to raise the orbit for WSF operations to 396 x 404 km x 28.5 deg.


The RMS was then used to grapple the Wake Shield Facility to establish a
data connection; the RMS remained attached to WSF overnight, and then
was used to unberth it early in the morning. The crew used the RMS to
move WSF over the side of the Orbiter and expose it to the direction of
flight (ram direction), to scrub it clean with the flow of the thin
upper atmosphere impacting it at orbital speeds. WSF was then moved on
the other side of the orbiter for release with its instrument side
oriented to the orbital wake, protected from further contamination. The
Wake Shield Facility was deployed into its first free flight on Sep 11
at 1125 UTC.


Mir
----

The EO-20 crew of Gidzenko, Avdeev, and Reiter, callsign `Uran', are now
on board the Mir complex. On previous international flights to Mir, the
visiting astronaut has had the title "Kosmonavt-issledovatel'"
(Cosmonaut-researcher). On this mission Reiter has extra
responsibilities and instead has the title "Bortinzhener-2" (Flight
Engineer 2). Gidzenko is "Komandir" (Commander) and Avdeev is
"Bortinzhener" (Flight Engineer), the usual designations. [Thanks to
Ashot Bakunts].

Progress M-28 undocked from the front port of Mir at 0607 UTC
on Sep 4 and was deorbited over the Pacific later that day.

The EO-19 crew returned to Earth on Sep 11 in the Soyuz TM-21 spaceship.
Anatoli Solov'yov and Nikolai Budarin undocked from the Kvant rear port
on Mir  at 0330:44 UTC and landed at 50 deg 41'N 68 deg 15'E, 108 km
northeast of Arkalyk in Kazakhstan, at 0652:40 UTC. [Thanks Vladimir!]
Soyuz TM-21 had been used to ferry the EO-18 crew (including Norm
Thagard) into space in March; the EO-18 crew returned to Earth in June
aboard Atlantis, which had delivered the EO-19 crew to the station.
The EO-19 flight lasted for 75 days 11 hr 20 min 22 sec, relatively
short by Mir standards. Solov'yov has now spent 453 days in space
on his four flights, which puts him fifth in the world rankings.


Recent Launches
--------------

As reported in JSR 254, the JCSAT 3 satellite was launched on Aug 29 at
0053:01 UTC by a Lockheed Martin Atlas IIAS.  Further data have become
available: The AC-117 Centaur stage ignited
at 0058:17 and burned for 4min 26s, shutting down at 0102:44 UTC in a
155 x 395 km x 28.2 deg parking orbit. At 0116:45 UTC the AC-117 stage
reignited for 1min 47s; Centaur MECO2 (main engine cutoff 2) was at
0118:32 UTC. The Centaur then separated and inserted the Hughes HS-601
JCSAT payload into a 167 x 81423 km x 23.5 deg orbit. On Aug 30, Space
Command elements gave JCSAT 3 in a 260 x 80799 km x 23.2 deg orbit.
The Centaur stage has not yet been cataloged. JCSAT 3 is owned
by Japan Satellite Systems (Kabushiki-gaisha Nihon Sateraito Sisutemuzu).

Obituary
--------

Reinhard Furrer, who flew on the Spacelab D-1 mission in 1985, 
died on Sep 9 at the age of 54. The Austrian-born physicist
was a payload specialist for the DFVLR (German space agency)
on the mission, aboard flight 61-A of Orbiter OV-099 Challenger.
He died in the crash of an antique Me-108 airplane at an air
show in Berlin. [Thanks to Andreas H"orstemeier for info.]

Shuttle
-------

The STS-69 mission was successfully completed on Sep 18.

The Wake Shield Facility carried out its free flight from Endeavour from
Sep 11 to Sep 14. The WSF satellite overheated and was placed in
safemode at 1200 UTC on Sep 12 but was reactivated at 0800 UT on Sep 13.
Four of the thin film high-vacuum manufacturing experiments were
completed during the flight.

By 1230 UTC on Sep 14 Endeavour completed its rendezvous with WSF and
began a series of experiments to study the contaminating effect of
thruster firings on the satellite. At around 1330 UTC the Orbiter began
the approach to WSF. It was grappled by the RMS arm at 1359 UTC on Sep
14 and was then reberthed on the carrier at 1518 UTC. The orbit was
lowered later that day to 338 x 346 km. WSF was unberthed again from
around 0700 to 1200 UTC and maneuvered around the cargo bay to measure
the electric field in the vicinity of the Orbiter.

On Sep 16 at around 0820 UTC Voss and Gernhardt began a 6h 46m spacewalk
to evaluate procedures and hardware for Space Station assembly. The
astronauts worked at the task board on the starboard side of Bay 3,
testing out foot restraints and assembling connectors; and flew at the
end of the robot arm in cold conditions to check modifications to the
spacesuit for cold weather conditions. The airlock was repressurized at
1502 UTC.

Endeavour returned to Earth on Sep 18 with a deorbit burn at 1035 UTC.
Main gear touchdown was at 1137:56 UTC on runway 33 at Kennedy Space
Center; wheels stop was at 1138:52. Mission duration from launch to main
gear touchdown was 10 days 20 hr 28 min 56 s. Total flight time for
OV-105 Endeavour over 9 flights is 2255h 21m.


The external tank for STS-74 was connected to the solid rocket
boosters on Sep 11. Examination of the STS-69 solid rocket boosters
confirms that the joint repair was successful; no erosion was seen.
The next Shuttle launch is mission STS-73 with orbiter Columbia,
due on Sep 28.

Mir
----

The EO-20/Euromir-95 crew of Gidzenko, Avdeev and Reiter remain
aboard the Mir complex. Next major events are the launch of the Progress
M-29 supply ship and a spacewalk on Oct 20.

Recent Launches
--------------

Kosmos-2319 is now in geostationary orbit at 80 deg E. The slot has been
used by both military communications and early warning satellites;
Kosmos-2319 may be a Geizer communications satellite.

 Longitudes of Kosmos satellites operating in GEO:

  Al'tair data relay:
   Kosmos-1897  52.6E
   Kosmos-2054  15.9W
  Geizer military communications:
   Kosmos-1961  79.3E
   Kosmos-2085  70.8E
   Kosmos-2172  13.5W
   Kosmos-2291  79.9E
  Probable missile early warning satellites:
   Kosmos-1894  25.6W
   Kosmos-2133  79.9E
   Kosmos-2209  24.2W
   Kosmos-2224  11.5E
   Kosmos-2282  24.1W

JCSAT 3 has lowered its orbit to geostationary. On Sep 10 it was in a
35718 x 42951 km x 0.25 deg orbit; by Sep 14 it was in a 35704 x 35921
km x 0.1 deg orbit at 128.2 E drifting 0.4 deg W per day. On Sep 11,
N-Star a was at 132.0E; the Mugunghwa-ho (Koreasat) satellite is on
station at 116.0E.

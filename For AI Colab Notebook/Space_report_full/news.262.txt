Shuttle
-------

Columbia is in orbit on the STS-73 mission. On Oct 27 its orbit
was 262 x 273 km x 39.0 deg. The mission is proceeding smoothly.


Mir
----

The crew of Gidzenko, Avdeev and Reiter continue work aboard
the Mir complex, in a 392 x 395 km x 51.6 deg orbit. The last
major orbit raise for the complex was in May 1995 and it
will probably be reboosted by 10 km or so in about a month.


Recent Launches
--------------

The first launch attempt of the Conestoga 1620 launch vehicle ended in
failure on Oct 23. The vehicle was destroyed 45s into the first stage
burn, at an altitude of 11 km. The Conestoga uses a Castor 4B first
stage core with Castor 4A and Castor 4B strapons, and a Star 48V upper
stage. Payload was EER Systems' Meteor commercial microgravity
recoverable spacecraft.

The UHF Followon F6 spacecraft, designated USA 114, was launched by
Lockheed Martin Atlas II AC-119 into a 551.9 min, 320 x 31500 km x 27.0
deg subsynchronous transfer orbit on Oct 22. The AC-119 Centaur stage
was left in a lower 267 x 27483 km x 27.0 deg orbit, presumably a
propellant depletion burn was used to lower its apogee after separation.
On Oct 25 the UHF payload fired its liquid apogee motor, raising its
orbit to 7657 x 36612 km x 14.7 deg. It is to be stationed at 100 deg W,
replacing Leasat 3 and providing UHF and EHF communications for the
US Navy.

On Oct 23 the Astra 1E television satellite raised its orbit from 25659
x 35737 km x 0.3 deg to 33680 x 36070 km x 0.2 deg. On Oct 20
Kosmos-2291, which was replaced at 80E last month, was still drifting
west at 3 deg per day over 23E. On Oct 26 the Luch-1 spacecraft moved
into geostationary orbit at 76.6E, although the orbit remains inclined
at 3.0 deg.

Kosmos-2322 was launched by a Zenit-2 launch vehicle on 
Oct 31 into a 851 x 877 km x 71.0 deg orbit. It is a Tselina-2
electronic intelligence spacecraft.

The reentry vehicle of the Resurs-F2 spacecraft landed after a 30 day
flight at 0537 UTC on Oct 26, 90 km SW of Troitsk in the Chelyabinsk
region. On Sep 26 the Resurs-F2 was launched into a 180 x 247 km x 82.3
deg parking orbit, which was raised to a 230 x 234 km x 82.3 deg
operational orbit on Sep 27. A small burn between Oct 6 and Oct 10
raised the decaying orbit from 226 x 232 km to 224 x 238 km. A similar
trim burn was made on Oct 18. On Oct 23, a larger burn raised the orbit
from 220 x 235 km to 255 x 278 km, and on Oct 26 the maneuvering engine
and associated hardware were jettisoned prior to the deorbit burn.

The Kosmos-2305 imaging recon satellite raised its orbit slightly on Oct 8, 
from 89.7min, 229 x 281 km x 64.9 deg to 89.9 min, 238 x 297 km x
64.9 deg. The previous such maneuver was carried out in early August.
The orbit of its companion Kosmos-2320 spacecraft has decayed to only
89.6 min, 227 x 277 km and will probably be reboosted soon.

Shuttle
-------

The STS-74 second Mir docking mission is complete. Atlantis delivered
the Docking Module to the Mir complex as well as  transferring 324 kg of
equipment and 640 kg of supplies to the complex and picking up 370 kg of
NASA, Russian and European equipment for return to Earth.

Atlantis undocked from Mir on Nov 18 at 0816 UT. At 0832 UT, Atlantis
had backed away to 120 m and began a flyaround. After two loops around
Mir, Atlantis fired its engines for a separation burn at 1004 UT.
The 316GK docking module remains attached to the Mir complex.
Later on Nov 18 Atlantis lowered its orbit from 92.39 min, 388 x 395 km
x 51.6 deg to 91.39 min, 337 x 348 km x 51.6 deg for operations
with the GLO-4 experiment.

Atlantis landed on Nov 20. The payload bay doors were closed at about
1320 UTC. The OMS engines ignited for the deorbit burn at 1558 UTC and
fired for 3 min 52 sec. After entry interface at 1630, the spacecraft
header for Florida. The landing gear was lowered at 1701:09 and main
gear touchdown was at 1701:27 UT on runway 33 at Kennedy Space Center.
The nose gear touched down at 1701:37 and Atlantis came to a stop at
1702:24. Mission duration was 8 days 4 hours 31 min.

The next Shuttle mission is STS-72, which will use orbiter OV-105
(Endeavour). The mission will retrieve the Japanese Space Flyer Unit
satellite and the crew will carry out two spacewalks.
The payload bay will contain:

 - An MPESS bridge carrying the SLA-1/GAS Hitchhiker-M payload, with 7 GAS
canisters. The canisters are: SLA-1 Shuttle Laser Altimeter canister;
ASC Altimeter Support Canister; G-342 (USAF Academy), to measure
dynamics of a vibrating beam;  G-459 (Soc. Japanese Aerospace
Companies), microgravity effects on protein crystals; G-740 (NASA-LeRC),
physics of fluids in microgravity, and GBP-1, a GAS ballast payload with
a particle collection device on top. The SLA-1 experiment is part of the
Mission to Planet Earth and will study the environmental and topographic
information obtainable from a laser altimeter for possible application
on later missions.

 - An MPESS type bridge, the Spartan Flight Support Structure,
carrying the Spartan 206 (OAST-Flyer) satellite which will be
released and retrieved.

 - A GAS beam adapter on the bay wall with two canisters carrying the
SSBUV atmospheric ozone spectrometer on its 8th mission.

 - probably a GAS beam or APC carrier on the bay wall to support
some kind of EVA hardware for the EDFT-3 spacewalks.


Mir
---

EO-20 crew Yuriy Gidzenko, Sergey Avdeev and Thomas Reiter remain aboard
the Mir complex. Its current configuration has the Kvant module docked
to the base block +X rear port, and three modules docked at the ports on
the transfer compartment: Spektr at -Y, Kvant-2 at +Y, and Kristall at
-Z, with the 316GK Docking Module attached to the end of Kristall. The
Progress M-29 cargo ferry is docked at the rear of Kvant (+X), while the
Soyuz TM-22 transport ship is docked at the front of Mir (-X). Launch of
the Progress M-30 cargo ferry is expected on December 15; Soyuz TM-23
will be launched on 21 Feb, the 77KSI Priroda module on Mar 10, the
Progress M-31 ferry on Apr 1, Progress M-32 on Jun 1, and Soyuz TM-24 on
Jul 6.

Shameless Plug

Readers of JSR may be interested to know that the latest issue of CSPACE
PRESS's magazine on the history of spaceflight, QUEST, contains an
article by me outlining the history of US reconnaissance satellite
programs, with a listing of all known US imaging recon sat flights,
as well as an article by Dwayne Day on the origins of the CORONA program.
The next issue will contain the second part of my article, covering
signals intelligence and early warning satellites. You can get QUEST
from CSPACE, PO Box 9331, Grand Rapids, MI 49509-0331, for $19.95
a year ($35.00 overseas air mail).

Meanwhile, following the flight of the final Resurs-F (JSR 258, 262) the
Russian magazine Novosti Kosmonavtiki has published a remarkable article
by M. Tarasenko and V. Agapov on the Resurs-F program, including a
detailed and complete list of launches with spacecraft serial numbers
and launch pads, and a discussion of the different Resurs-F variants.
(Nov. Kos. 1995 No. 20, from Videocosmos, cosmos@space.accessnet.ru).

Recent Launches
--------------

The second Gals direct broadcast TV satellite was launched on Nov 17 by a
Proton from Baykonur. The Proton probably used the new DM2M (11S861-01)
upper stage. According to Ron Baalke's Space Calendar, the satellite has
been bought by the Land Group, a Chinese company. Gals satellites are
built by NPO Prikladnoi Mekhaniki. On Nov 19, Gals 2 was at 88 deg E
drifting 1 deg W per day in a 1441.7 min, 35764 x 36026 km x 0.2 deg
orbit. (Does anyone have more details on the Land Group and their
purchase of Gals satellites?)

The Kosmos-2291 Geizer-class comsat has reached its new location at
14.7W, presumably backing up Kosmos-2172 at 13.3W. In October
Kosmos-2291 was replaced at 80E by the new Kosmos-2319 satellite and
began a slow drift to its new location. Geizer satellites relay
telecommunications for the Russian Ministry of Defence.

ESA's Infrared Space Observatory raised its perigee in a 111 min burn on
Nov 19. The orbit was altered from 500 x 71577 km x 5.2 deg to 1030 x
71606 km x 5.2 deg. A second burn to lower the apogee is expected on Nov
24. Initial checks of the ISOPHOT instrument were successful.

The US Navy's UHF F6 circularized its orbit on Oct 29 and by Nov 6 was
on station at 171W over the Pacific. The new SES European commercial
television satellite Astra 1E is now at 14.7E.

The European Meteorological Satellite Organization's Meteosat 4 weather
satellite appears to have been retired. It raised its orbit on Nov 8
out of the geostationary ring at 10 deg E to a storage orbit of 1482.9
min, 36618 x 36776 km x 1.5 deg.

Hughes Communications' Galaxy 3 satellite may also have been retired
(can anyone confirm this?) Orbital data from Space Command indicate it
moved 120 km up out of geostationary orbit into a 1442.4 min period
drift orbit around Oct 3; an orbit released on Oct 20 showing it still
on station is inconsistent with more recent data. In late October SBS 6
was moved from 95W to 74W, joining Galaxy 6.

Between Nov 13 and Nov 20 the Kosmos-2320 recon satellite raised its
orbit from 231 x 274 km to 239 x 300 km in a standard orbit maintenance
burn.

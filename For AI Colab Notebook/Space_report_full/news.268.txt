Shuttle
-------

The next Shuttle mission is STS-72, scheduled for January 11. 
The EDFT-3 spacewalk payload on Endeavour will allow the
astronauts to test prototype Space Station hardware, including
a special `umbilical' carrier which supports electrical cables
and fluid pipes, and the new portable work platform which
Space Station astronauts will use in their spacewalk assembly
tasks. The EDFT-3 payload consists of: (major acronym ahead
 warning!)
 Bay 1 Port:  PIT Utility Box, for Space Station Pre-Integrated
 Truss electronics; the two boxes will be connected up during the
 spacewalk to simulate truss on-orbit assembly.
 Bay 2 Port:  PIT Utility Box and PRUM (Portable Rigid Umbilical
 Mount), for slotting the RU across the payload bay, and CCA (Cable
 Caddy Assembly). Bay 2 Port carries a GAS Beam adapter plate
 (I still don't know the adapter plate types used for the other 
 EDFT-3 equipment.)
 Bay 3 Port:  Rigid Umbilical (RU)
 Bay 4 Port:  Rigid Umbilical (RU). The Space Station RU, in bays 3 and 4 Port,
 has two segments connected by a hinge. It will be unpacked and installed
 diagonally across the bay from bays 3P to 4S, and the astronauts will
 test its connector systems.
 Bay 1 Stbd:  ASEM Node Carrier, stowage for slidewire cable etc.
 Bay 2 Stbd:  PWP (Portable Work Platform), consisting of the
  TERA (Temporary Equipment Restraining Aid), which attaches equipment
  to the robot arm using a Flight Releasable Grapple Fixture; the
  APFR (Articulating Portable Foot Restraint), which goes on the
  end of the robot arm and provides the astronaut with a place to stand; and
  PFRWS (Portable Foot Restraint Workstation Stanchions) which
  attach to the APFR  and  provide handholds and tool holders 
  for an astronaut working in the APFR.
  Bay 2 also carries the CLAS Sensor 2 Task Plate which measures
  loads exerted by the crew.
 Bay 3 Stbd: CLAS Sensor 3 Task Plate, which is part of the 
 Crew Loads Assembly System for measuring the force needed to do
 certain tasks.
 Bay 4 Stbd: SURF Starboard Umbilical Receiver Fixture, for slotting
 the RU across the payload bay.

Mir
---

The EO-20 cosmonauts Gidzenko and Avdeev depressurized the Mir
transfer compartment for a 37 minute EVA to transfer the docking cone
from the -Z axis (Kristall) to the +Z port where Priroda will
dock. Hatch open was at 1915 UTC on Dec 8. (Info from Chris van den
Berg).

As predicted in JSR 262, Mir's orbit was raised on Dec 9 using the
Progress M-29 cargo ferry's engine.  The mean altitude was raised by
only 5 km, from 92.41 min, 390 x 395 km x 51.6 deg to 92.46 min, 390 x
399 km x 51.6 deg. Launch of the Progress M-30 cargo ferry is expected
on December 18 at 1431 UTC.

Recent Launches
--------------

Lockheed Martin launched AC-120, an Atlas IIA Centaur vehicle, on Dec
15. AC-120 carried the Hughes Galaxy IIIR satellite into geostationary
transfer orbit. Galaxy IIIR is an HS-601 class satellite.  It will
provide C band (24 transponders) video distribution in the US, and
Ku-band (24 transponders) direct broadcast TV to Latin America.
Galaxy 3R's initial orbit was 200 x 34348 km x 26.94 deg with
a period of 603.4 minutes.

The USA 116 recon satellite was inserted into a 156 x 976 km x 98.7 deg
orbit, according to ITAR-TASS quoting sources in the Russian Ministry
of Defense. It has since raised its perigee to around 250 km, according
to Russian sources. This is an excellent match to the 250 x 1000 km 
orbit of the earlier Improved CRYSTAL, USA 86.

The Galileo probe descended 160 km below the Jovian cloud tops on Dec 7,
surviving for 57 minutes after the beginning of entry. Flyby of the
Orbiter past Io was at 892 km, not 1000 km, according to the Dec 8 
Galileo status report. The line of sight from Jupiter to Earth passes
too close to the Sun at the moment for reliable data transmission,
and the remainder of the probe data will be relayed starting next
month.

The VKS (Russian Space Forces) launched a Proton-K vehicle with a
Blok-DM2 upper stage from Baykonur on Dec 14. The rocket inserted
three Uragan navigation satellites, nos. 776, 778 and 782, into 19000
km circular orbits at an inclination of 64.8 degrees. The Uragan
spacecraft, which form part of the GLONASS (Global'naya
Navigatsionnaya Sputnikovaya Sistema) navigation system, were given
the cover names Kosmos-2323, Kosmos-2324 and Kosmos-2325.
They are in GLONASS plane 2. (Source: VKS CSIC).

Erratum: the Gals and Luch-1 launches carried the Blok-DM2 upper
stage, not the DM2M.

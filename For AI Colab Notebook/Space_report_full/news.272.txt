Shuttle
-------

Space Shuttle Endeavour was launched on 1996 Jan 11,  at 0941:00 UTC,
beginning mission STS-72. Endeavour entered a 66 x 455 km x 28.5 deg
transfer orbit at main engine cutoff (0949:35), followed
by separation of the ET-75 external tank (0949:47). The OMS-2 apogee burn
at 1024:30 placed the OV-105 spacecraft in a 180 x 460 km orbit.
The NSR rendezvous burn tomorrow will place Endeavour on track
to meet up with the SFU satellite, currently in a 469 x 478 km
x 28.5 deg orbit. The Japanese National Space Development Agency's
Space Flyer Unit (SFU) was launched by an H-II rocket in Mar 1995.
A NASDA astronaut, Koichi Wakata, is a member of the STS-72 crew.

The STS-72 launch was unusual in that for the first time there
was no mission requirement for a transatlantic landing (TAL) 
abort site, since with a single engine failure the Orbiter could
have made it either to orbit or back to the Cape at all times
during the ascent. Two engine failures might have caused the
crew to go to the Banjul, Gambia, site since the weather
was bad at the mission's nominal TAL site at Ben Guerir,
Morocco.

Payloads on STS-72 include the Spartan 206 satellite (known
also as OAST Flyer) and the EDFT-3 spacewalk experiment.

Errata
-------

In JSR 271A, the Start launch fell on Russia, not the Sea of Okhotsk as
originally reported. NIITT should read MITT - Moscow Institute of
Thermal Technology. Gals-2 was procured and delivered on orbit to Land
by AO Informkosmos, so change owner to Informkosmos/Land. The UNAMSAT
was built by Moscow State University for UNAM. Molniya-3 is probably
owned by MSvyazi (Russian Federation Ministry of Communications).
Finally, it is more accurate to call the Foton and Resurs buses 'Zenit',
instead of 'Vostok', the design is ultimately derived from the
Vostok and Zenit spacecraft first built in 1960-63.

In JSR 271B, the Israeli Shaviyt was omitted from the summary table, and
an extra Zenit appeared mysteriously. The totals should have read 80
launches, not 79. The Soyuz launchers are from TsSKB/Progress, not
Energiya.

Recent Launches
--------------

IRS-1C raised its orbit on Jan 1 from 805 x 817 km to 816 x 818 km.

The Skipper satellite (JSR270) will investigate UV emission from a body
entering the Earth's atmosphere. It will dip in and out of the
atmosphere in a low perigee orbit. (Thanks to Gunter Krebs for info).
However, as of Jan 10 Skipper was still being recorded by Space Command
in its original 804 x 813 km orbit. (To be more precise, there are
three objects from the 1995-72 launch. Object A, identified as IRS,
raised its orbit. Objects B and C, which I am assuming are Skipper
and the 2BL rocket stage, are in the 804 x 813 km orbit. Space Command
has not as far as I know identified either object as Skipper. It is possible
that Skipper is actually a fourth, uncataloged object but at the moment
I find this unlikely.)

Shuttle
-------

The next Shuttle mission is STS-75/Columbia, featuring the reflight of
the Tethered Satellite System. The cargo includes the TSS-1R Spacelab
pallet and deployable TSS satellite with its 20 km tether; the TSS-1R
MPESS truss with electrodynamics instrumentation; and two more MPESS
cross-bay structures carrying the experiments for the USMP-3 (United
States Microgravity Payload) mission.

Crew of STS-75 are commander Lt-Col Andrew Allen, USMC/NASA, pilot
Lt-Col Dr. Scott Horowitz, USAF/NASA,  payload commander Dr. Franklin
Chang-Diaz, NASA, mission specialists Dr. Jeff Hoffmann, NASA,  Claude
Nicollier, ESA, and Lt-Col. Maurizio Cheli, Italian Air Force, ESA, and 
payload specialist Dr. Umberto Guidoni, ASI. (ASI is Agenzia Spaziale
Italiano; ESA is European Space Agency; NASA is National Aeronautics and
Space Administration.)  Allen, Horowitz and Hoffmann are from the US;
Chang-Diaz is a naturalized US citizen from Costa Rica; Cheli and
Guidoni are Italians and Nicollier is from Switzerland. This mission is
extremely unusual in that not only is the main payload flying for a
second time, but most of the crew are held over from that TSS-1 (STS-46)
mission. Allen, Chang-Diaz, Hoffmann, and Nicollier flew on STS-46 with
Loren Shriver, Marsha Ivins and Franco Malerba. Horowitz, Cheli and
Guidoni are making their first flights.

Recent Launches
--------------

A Gorizont broadcasting satellite was launched from Baykonur on Jan 25.
It used a Proton-K launch vehicle with a standard Blok-DM2 upper stage.
Gorizont satellites provide C and Ku band communications and are
built by NPO Prikladnoi Mekhaniki of Krasnoyarsk. Mikhail Reshetnev,
founder of NPO-PM and one of the last of the surviving Chief Designers
of the early Soviet space program, died on Jan 29.

The first Atlas launch of the year came in the early hours of Feb 1. The
Indonesian satellite Palapa C-1, a Hughes HS-601 spacecraft, was
launched by a Lockheed Martin Atlas IIAS from Cape Canaveral. Centaur
AC-126 placed Palapa in a supersynchronous transfer orbit of 240 x 89462
km x 21.9 deg. The apogee will slowly be lowered to synchronous
altitude. Indonesia was the first developing country to purchase a
domestic satellite communications system; the HS-333 class Palapa A
satellites began linking the islands of the Indonesian archipelago in
1976. They were replaced by HS-376 class Palapa B satellites in the
1980s, starting with Palapa B-1 launched on Shuttle mission 7 (Sally
Ride's flight) in 1983.

The GOES 3 weather satellite arrived at 103W in January. It had been
drifting from 180W since early 1995.

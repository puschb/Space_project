Shuttle
-------

The next Shuttle mission is STS-75/Columbia, due on Feb 22.


Mir
---

Yuriy Gidzenko and Thomas Reiter carried out a 3 hour 2 min spacewalk on
Feb 8, starting around 1307 UTC from the Kvant-2 airlock. The walk was
reportedly  shorter than planned due to a pressurization problem in the
suit of EO-20 mission commander Gidzenko. The astronauts recovered some
samples which had been exposed to space  on the exterior of the Spektr
module (the ESEF or European Space Exposure Facility) to study the
effects of radiation, vacuum and debris impacts. Launch of the EO-21
crew, Yuriy Ivanovich Onufrienko and Yuriy Vladimirovich Usachyov
(callsign Skif-1 and Skif-2) will take place on Feb 21.


Recent Launches
--------------

Ariane V83 was launched on Feb 5 from Arianespace's South
American launch site, the Centre Spatiale Guyanais. It placed in
orbit the N-STAR b satellite, built by Space Systems/Loral
for the Japanese telecommunications company NTT. N-STAR b uses the
FS-1300 bus. N-STAR b entered a 127 x 37111 km x 6.9 deg
transfer orbit, raised by Feb 6 to 6723 x 35780 km x 3.6 deg, and
again by Feb 8 to 29236 x 35766 km x 0.5 deg.

Japan's National Space Development Agency (NASDA) and Institute of Space
and Astronautical Sciences (ISAS) have test-flown the new J-1 launch
vehicle in its two-stage version.  The first stage is the NASDA H-II SRB
(solid rocket strapon for the H-II), and the second stage is the M23
second stage from the ISAS Mu-3S-II launch vehicle. A three stage
orbital version of J-1 will also use the M3B third stage from Mu-3S-II.
J-1 (1F) was launched from Tanegashima's Osaki Range H-1/J-1 launch pad, 
previously used for the N and H-I launch vehicles, at 2300 UTC on Feb
11. The M23 stage of the J-1, with the HYFLEX payload attached, was
expected to reach an apogee of 110 km on its suborbital flight.

At 2304 UTC the HYFLEX payload separated from the M23 stage onto a
descending suborbital trajectory. HYFLEX is a lifting body developed by
NASDA and the NAL (National Aerospace Lab) to develop shuttle
technology. It has ceramic heat shield tiles and a gaseous nitrogen
reaction control system. After reentry (max Mach number of 15), it
splashed down by parachute 300 km NE of the Ogasawara Islands in the
Pacific (NASDA has a downrange station at Ogasawara). A flotation bag
attachment device failed and HYFLEX sank in the ocean.

Shuttle
-------

Columbia landed at 1358:21 UTC on runway 33 at Kennedy Space Center,
bringing mission STS-75 to a close. Landing was delayed one day
because of bad weather at the Cape. The Tethered Satellite was 
in a 296 x 360 km x 28.5 deg orbit on Mar 11, still trailing its 19 km
long tether. (The 22 km figure I gave last week was an error).

NASA has announced that both of the `wiper' O-rings at the
case-to-nozzle joints of the SRBs on STS-75 were scorched by hot gas.
The wiper O-rings are NOT joint seals, but merely protect the actual
(primary and secondary) O-ring seals during assembly, according to NASA.
Wiper O-ring damage has been seen before, but this time each O-ring was
singed in two places instead of one. (Details are from Reuter; this
doesn't sound too terrible, but of course hot gas being where it
shouldn't in an SRB is a bit nervous making.) NASA has reportedly since
decided that the situation is well understood and the next mission,
STS-76, will proceed on schedule. It will feature another docking with
the Mir space station.


Recent Launches
---------------

The Pegasus XL launch vehicle has made its first successful flight. The
US Air Force REX-II satellite was launched into orbit aboard the third
XL  on Mar 9. REX-II is a Space Test Program satellite (flight P94-2)
built by CTA/SS (formerly DSI). The payload, sponsored by USAF Rome Lab,
will study ionospheric electron density irregularities that affect radio
communications. A secondary experiment will use GPS for on-orbit
attitude determination and control, a milestone in the integration of
satellite navigation techniques into the business of navigating and
controlling satellites themselves. The successful launch of REX-II is
good news for Orbital Sciences Corp. and for all small satellite
missions which are waiting for a ride to orbit, following the  failures
of the two previous Pegasus XL missions as well as of the  sole
Conestoga and LLV launches. The L-1011 carrier aircraft took off from
Vandenberg AFB at 0035 UTC on Mar 9 and  went to the drop zone 100 km W
of Monterey, California at an altitude of 12 km. Drop was at 0133 UTC on
Mar 9. The satellite is Space Command number 23814 with orbit 101.25
min, 803 x 832 km x 90.0 deg. The USAF reports that the satellite is
operating well.

Chinese sources now report that six people died and 57 were injured
during the crash of the Chang Zheng 3B (Long March 3B) launch vehicle
at Xichang on Feb 14. Other sources claim that more than a hundred
may have died. The rocket's inertial guidance unit failed two seconds after
takeoff. 

NASA's GGS Polar satellite has raised its perigee, but Space Command hasn't
released new orbital elements yet. According to the Lockheed Martin
mission ops page, the new orbit has a perigee of 11500 km. Orbit raising
burns were made on Feb 26, 0200 UTC on Feb 28, 1854 on Feb 28, 1140 on
Feb 29 and 0436 UTC on Mar 1.  The first Feb 28 burn was aborted after
18 minutes due to valve overheating, causing some of the later burns to
be rescheduled. Polar has extended its antennae: the U wires were
deployed to 65 meters and the V wires to 50 meters on Mar 10.

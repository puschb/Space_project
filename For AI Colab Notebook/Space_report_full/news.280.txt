Launch of OV-104 Atlantis on the third Mir docking mission, STS-76, is
scheduled for Mar 21. The cargo bay includes the Orbiter Docking System
and the Spacehab Flight Unit 2 module, which previously flew on the
SH-02 (STS-60) flight in 1994. On this mission, the Spacehab module is
carrying supplies for the Mir station. Also in the cargo bay are four
Passive Experiment Carriers on the sidewall  (possibly GAS Adapter
beams?) with the MEEP (Mir Environmental Effects Payload) experiments
which will be placed on the outside of the Mir Docking Module in the
course of a spacewalk by astronauts Linda Godwin and Rich Clifford. The
four MEEP experiments are the Polished Plate Micrometeoroid and Debris
experiment, the Orbital Debris Collector, and the Passive Optical Sample
Assembly I and II exposure experiments which will be used to qualify
materials for Space Station use. The Mir Docking Module is where Atlantis
docks to the Mir complex; the cylindrical module was brought to the station
on Atlantis' last flight in November, and is attached to the end of the
Kristall module.

Other sidewall mounted payloads on STS-76 are  the TRIS cosmic ray
Getaway Special canister on a GAS Beam and a small APC sidewall carrier
with the TCS laser ranger for rendezvous operations. Godwin and Clifford
will carry the SAFER backpack on their spacewalk in its first
operational use as a backup rescue device. SAFER was test flown on
STS-64.

STS-76 crew commander is Kevin Chilton; pilot is Rick Searfoss; payload
commander is Ron Sega, mission specialists are Linda Godwin, Rich
Clifford, and Shannon Lucid. Lucid will remain on the Mir station,
joining the EO-21 crew of Yuriy Onufrienko and Yuriy Usachyov. She will
be the first woman to make five flights, and at 53 is the oldest woman
to fly in space. Of the 1978 group of women astronauts selected by NASA,
Lucid and Rhea Seddon remain active, and Anna Fisher recently returned
to active status after a several-year leave of absence (she hasn't flown
since 1985). Sally Ride left the group in 1987, and Kathy Sullivan left
in 1992 to become chief scientist at the NOAA weather agency. Judy
Resnik died in the 51-L accident in 1986.

Correction: I reported the landing of Soyuz TM-22 as being in Kazakhstan
(JSR 278). As Jim Oberg has pointed out, the correct spelling of this
country in the Latin alphabet is now deemed to be Kazakstan (no 'h'),
reflecting the modifications to the post-Soviet Kazak alphabet 
(Qazaqstan would be a more consistent transliteration, but the name of
the country and the people is to be spelt with K as a special case).
Jim also reports that the town formerly known as Leninsk, which lies
next to Kosmodrom Baykonur (Test Range NIIP-5), has now been officially
named Baykonur.

Recent Launches
---------------

The Intelsat 707 communications satellite was launched by an Arianespace
Ariane 44LP launch vehicle on Mar 14. It will be placed over the
Atlantic. The success of 707 follows the loss of the Intelsat 708
satellite which was destroyed in the explosion of a Chang Zheng 3B
rocket last month. Intelsat 707 is a Space Systems/Loral FS-1300 class
satellite. It was inserted into a 189 x 35772 km x 7.0 deg transfer orbit.

A Yantar'-class imaging recon satellite was launched on Mar 14 from
Plesetsk. Given the code name Kosmos-2331, it was placed in a 164 x 355
km orbit with an inclination of 67.1 degrees by a Soyuz-U launch
vehicle. This Russian Defense Ministry payload carries a US Department
of Defense secondary experiment launched as part of the Space Test
Program, the BINRAD package which will attempt to detect the presence of
beryllium at orbital altitudes. BINRAD was flown twice before on Russian
civilian Resurs-F remote sensing missions.

The Pegasus XL launch was carried out from 36 deg N, 123 deg W  which I
understand is in special use airspace W-283, San Francisco Warning Area,
rather than in W-532, Point Arguello Warning Area just south of there
(can pilots confirm?) The L-1011 aircraft is based in Bakersfield,
California, but for launches takes off from runway 30/12 at Vandenberg
AFB. The REX-II satellite launched on the Pegasus has now extended its
6-m long gravity gradient boom.

The FSW-1 (Jianbing-93) recovery capsule, stranded in orbit in 1993,
reentered over the ocean on Mar 12.

The ECS 1 (Eutelsat I F-1) satellite raised its orbit in February
and is now drifting. Koreasat 2 is now on station at 113.0 deg E.
The Telecom 1C satellite has moved from 3.0 deg E to 1.0 deg E.
Intelsat 501 moved back into the geostationary ring at 72.0E (Indian Ocean).

The Galileo orbit made a perijove raise burn at apojove on Mar 14,
changing its orbit from 185000 x 19000000 km to 670000 x 19000000 km
and targeting it for a close approach to Ganymede on Jun 27.

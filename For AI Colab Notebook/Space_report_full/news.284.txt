Shuttle and Mir
---------------

STS-76 Mission Specialist-4, Dr. Shannon Lucid, remains aboard the Mir
complex. Despite the implication in some NASA reports during STS-76 that
her title on the crew is Cosmonaut-researcher, (which most `guest
cosmonauts' have had, and which is equivalent to Payload Specialist)
more recent Mir EO-21 status reports indicate she has the (Mission
Specialist equivalent) title of Flight Engineer-2 (Bortizhener-2), which
ESA astronaut Thomas Reiter also held on his long duration mission.

Space Shuttle Endeavour (OV-105) was moved from the Orbiter
Processing Facility to the Vehicle Assembly Building on Apr 8,
and was mated to the external tank for STS-77. The stack was
rolled out to pad 39B on Apr 16. (Pad 39A is undergoing
refurbishment and has not been used recently).

Mission STS-77 will carry the Airlock Tunnel
Adapter, the Spacehab Flight Unit 1 module (on mission SH-04), 
and three cross-bay MPESS structures. One will carry the Spartan 207
satellite, another carries the TEAMS payload, and the third
is the GBA-9 GAS Bridge.

Spartan 207 carries the IAE (Inflatable Antenna Experiment) payload.
TEAMS is a Hitchhiker-M payload  carrying a zero-g refuelling
experiment, a GPS navigation experiment, and the PAMS Passive
Aerodynamically-Stabilized Magnetically-Damped Satellite. GBA-9 carries
eleven Getaway Special (GAS) canisters:

 G-056  Caltech
 G-063  Lockheed Martin/Penn State
 G-142  DARA, German space agency
 G-144  DARA
 G-163  European Space Agency
 G-200  Utah State University
 G-490  British Sugar
 G-564  Canadian Space Agency
 G-565  Canadian Space Agency
 G-703  NASA-Lewis
 G-741  NASA-Lewis

G-056 is the GAMCIT gamma ray burst detector
built by Caltech's SEDS student organization.

Recent Launches
---------------

The launch of Astra 1F on Apr 8 demonstrated a new profile for RKK
Energiya's Blok-DM2 upper stage. The Krunichev three-stage Proton-K
launch vehicle entered a standard parking orbit of 213 x 219 km x 51.6
deg. The Blok-DM2/Astra 1F combination separated and the Blok-DM2
ignited to enter an elliptical orbit of 11970 x 35936 km x 6.95 deg.
This probably involved two burns of the Blok-DM2, and we may soon see
the SOZ ullage motor units cataloged in a 200 x 36000 km x 47 degree
transfer orbit. Usually the second burn of the DM2 takes the payload all
the way to geosynchronous orbit, since the Russian geosats do not have
apogee motors of their own, but the heavy Astra 1F instead used its own
liquid apogee engine to complete the ascent, first lowering inclination
and raising perigee to 27160 x 35994 km x 0.9 deg, and then by Apr 11 to
30135 x 36147 km. By Apr 15, Astra 1F was in a 35757 x 35791 km x 0.1
deg orbit over 27.0 deg E, drifting 0.1 deg per day.

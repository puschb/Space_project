Shuttle and Mir
---------------

The 77KSI (TsM-I) Priroda module was launched by Proton from Baykonur on
Apr 23. The 19500 kg Priroda is the final module for the Mir complex,
and was built by the Krunichev factory. 77KSI carries a set of remote
sensing experiments and some microgravity experiments:

 MSU-SK and MSU-E optical and infrared scanners
 OZON-M ozone profile detector
 ISTOK-1 infrared spectrometer
 MOS Imaging spectrometer, Germany
 ALISA LIDAR optical sounder, France
 IKAR-N, IKAR-D scanning and pointing microwave radiometers
 IKAR-P microwave radiometer
 TRAVERS Synthetic aperture radar operating at 9 and 23 cm
 MOMS-2P Stereoscopic imagers
 MIM  Microgravity Isolation Mount, Canada

On Apr 25 one of the two battery systems on Priroda failed. Priroda does
not carry solar panels. Fortunately, Priroda docked with Mir at 1243 UTC
on Apr 26. This is the first time one of the 77KS modules has docked on
the first attempt. On Apr 27, Priroda was due to be rotated from
the -X port to the +Z port. Kristall is at -Z, Kvant-2 at +Y, Spektr
at -Y, and Kvant at +X. The Soyuz TM-23 craft is docked to the +X port
of Kvant, and the Stikovochnoy Otsek (Docking Module) is attached
at the -Z port of Kristall. 

Recent Launches
---------------

The Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX) was launched at 1227:40 UTC on Apr
24 from Vandenberg into an 896 x 906 km x 99 deg orbit. MSX is a
Ballistic Missile Defense Organization satellite which will study the
infrared, visible and ultraviolet signatures of ballistic missiles in
their midcourse phase (after the launch vehicle rocket plume has shut
down). The main experiment on MSX is the Spirit III cryogenic infrared
telescope, the first to use solid hydrogen instead of the liquid helium
that has been used by infrared astronomy satellites in the past. The
hydrogen will maintain the dewar at 8.5K. MSX will also perform civilian
scientific research, with atmospheric observations and astronomical
studies. The MSX spacecraft was built by Johns Hopkins University's
Applied Physics Lab.
 MSX instruments are:
  SPIRIT III,  0.34m Spatial IR Imaging Telescope, 2.5 -28 microns
  UVISI   UV and Visible Imagers and Spectrographic Imagers
  CIC     Contamination Instrumentation Complement
  (to study outgassing and contamination of optical surfaces)
  SBV     Space Based Visible camera, 0.15m telescope/CCD


Titan IV K-16 was launched from Cape Canaveral on Apr 24. It was a Titan
401 variant with a Centaur upper stage, and the payload is probably a
geostationary orbit signals  intelligence satellite.

Kosmos-2332 was launched on Apr 24. It entered a 303 x 1575 km  x 83 deg
orbit, characteristic of radar calibration satellites including Kosmos-1179,
Kosmos-1463 and Kosmos-2265. It is believed that these satellites are
spherical in shape and may be based on the Vostok/Zenit descent cabin
shell.

Telesat Mobile Inc. (TMI) of Canada's M-SAT satellite was launched by
Ariane on Apr 20. M-SAT uses the Hughes HS-601 design, but its prime
contractor was Spar Aerospace of Canada (a similar industrial
partnership was used for the Anik D satellites in the 1980s in which
Spar used the Hughes HS-376 design). The satellite is almost identical
to the AMSC-1 satellite launched last year for American Mobile Satellite
Corp., and carries L-band transponders for communications between mobile
users.

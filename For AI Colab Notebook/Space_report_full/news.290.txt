Shuttle and Mir
---------------

Launch of mission STS-78 is scheduled for Jun 20. A Spacelab Long Module
is in Columbia's cargo bay together with the EDO (Extended Duration
Orbiter) pallet with extra consumables to support the long 16-day
mission. Crew of STS-78 are Col. Terence `Tom' Henricks, Kevin Kregel,
Capt. Susan Helms, Dr. Charles Brady, M.D., Dr. Richard Linnehan,
D.Vet.M, Dr. Bob Thirsk, M.D., and Dr. Jean-Jacques Favier, Ph.D. Thirsk
is from the Canadian Space Agency and Favier is from the French CNES
space agency. The crew will carry out the Life and Microgravity Science
Spacelab (LMS) mission.

The Mir EO-21 crew's 5th EVA took place at 1656 UTC on Jun 6 and lasted 3 hr
34 min. Onufrienko and Usachyov installed experiments to study the space
environment on the outer surface of the station. EVA-6 took place on Jun
13, and involved the filming of the second part of a commercial for
Pepsi-Cola. It lasted 5 hr 42 min.

Errata
-------

I got the launch time of Galaxy 9 wrong - it should have been 0110 UTC
on May 24.

I missed two types of rocket from my launch vehicle list last week:
first, the Conestoga, which uses the Castor 4B as its core. As far as I
know, the Castor 4 series first flew on an Athena H reentry test vehicle
in 1971. The second one I missed was the NOTSnik Project Pilot air
launched vehicle, recently declassified, which was used in 1958 and used
a small HOTROC solid motor cluster as its first stage. Two of the 1958
Pilot launches may have reached orbit.

   HOTROC       Pilot         1958 Jul  4    F       1958 Jul 25   S?   
   Castor 4B    Conestoga     1971 Apr  3            1995 Oct 23   F

The LLV-1 (now LMLV-1) was deliberately omitted since it used the
Castor 120 core, which is part of the same rocket family as
the TU-904 used for Taurus, although a different variant.

Recent Launches
---------------

Ariane flight V87 was successfully launched on Jun 15. A member of the
original Ariane family, the Ariane 44P model rocket placed its H-10-III
third stage and the Intelsat 709 comsat in geostationary transfer orbit.
The success is good news for Arianespace after the failure of the first
Ariane 5 launch.

Intelsat 709 is an Intelsat VIIA satellite using the Space Systems/Loral
FS-1300 bus. The satellite has a mass of 1473 kg dry, or 3420 kg
including all its propellant. It has 26 C-band and 10 Ku-band
transponders and will be stationed at 18 deg W over the Atlantic to
provide transatlantic telephone, TV and data relay for the International
Telecommunications Satellite Organization.

Here are more details of the Ariane 5 flight from ESA:
1233:59 UTC: Vulcain main engine ignition
1234:06 UTC: EAP ignition, liftoff
1234:36 UTC: Altitude 3.5 km
1234:36 UTC: EAP solid booster nozzles swivel to limit
             Vulcain main engine swivels to limit
             Ariane 5 tilts sharply
1234:38 UTC: EPC structural failure
1234:38 UTC: Onboard destruct system fired 

ESA says: "The direction of inquiry is tending towards the launcher's
electrical and software system". The on board computer incorrectly
decided that the vehicle was off course and commanded a sharp
turn, which then did in fact send Ariane off course. An automatic
on board destruct system fired once the vehicle started to disintegrate.

The Clipper Graham (DC-XA) made its second flight at 1615 UTC on Jun 7.
The 62-second flight was successful. A third flight one day later
was also successful and proved the rapid turnaround concept.

Gorizont No. 44L, launched on May 25, is now on station at 53 degrees East.

Shuttle and Mir
---------------

Orbiter OV-102 Columbia was launched on 1996 Jun 20 at 1449:20 UTC on
mission STS-78, carrying the Life and Microgravity Science Spacelab
(LMS-1). Launch was from Mobile Launch Platform 3 at Complex 39B. The
solid rocket boosters, serial RSRM-55, separated at about 1451:24, with
main engine cutoff (MECO) at 1457 UTC. External tank ET-79 separated
from the Orbiter a few seconds later. The OMS engines were fired for
the OMS-2 burn to circularize the orbit about half an hour later,
and the payload bay doors were opened at around 1615 UTC.
Inital orbit was 272 x 285 km x 39.0 deg; by Jul 2 the orbit was
259 x 268 km x 39.0 deg. The medical and materials processing
experiments on Spacelab are proceeding well, and the mission
is scheduled to last a record 17 days.

Does anyone know which Spacelab Long Module flight unit is being used on
this flight? There are two. My guess is that it is Unit 2 (FOP), which was
first flown on Spacelab D-1 in 1985 and was probably last used on the
Spacelab Mir mission (STS-71).

Orbiter 104 Atlantis was moved to the VAB on Jun 24, and attached to the
external tank and solid rocket boosters. The stack was rolled out to pad
39A on Jul 1 in preparation for a Jul 31 launch on mission STS-79 to
Mir.

Discovery has returned to the Cape from its refurbishment in California.
It left Palmdale aboard the SCA (Boeing 747) on Jun 28. The SCA
refuelled at Altus AFB, Oklahoma and spent the night at Robins AFB, GA.
On Jun 29 it flew from Robins to KSC, and on Jun 30 it was towed to
Orbiter Processing Facility Bay 2. Its next mission is STS-82, to
refurbish the Hubble Space Telescope.

Errata

Apologies to Lt. Col. Helms (pilot, STS-78) for not having noted her
promotion in the last issue.

Recent Launches
---------------

Igor Lissov reports that another Soyuz-U launch vehicle failed to reach
orbit on Jun 20 after 50 seconds of flight. This is the second Soyuz-U
failure in a row, following the loss of a recon satellite on May 14.
Rumour has it that the payload shroud failed in both cases.

Orbital Sciences Corp. successfully launched the fourth Pegasus XL on
Jul 2. It placed into orbit NASA-Goddard's TOMS/Earth Probe ozone
monitoring satellite. The L-1011 Stargazer carrier airplane took off
from Vandenberg AFB and released the three stage Pegasus XL rocket over
the drop zone in the Pacific. Florida Today reports the launch as 0742
UTC; the TOMS web page reports 0748 UTC. Orbit is 345 x 954 km  x 97.4
deg, to be raised later to a circular 500 km. TOMS/EP was built by TRW
and is based on the STEP/Eagle small satellite bus. It carries a single
instrument, the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer. The 188 kg satellite
carries 73 kg of fuel for the orbit raising system. Earlier TOMS
instruments flew on Nimbus 7 (1978) and Meteor-3 No. 5 (1991), and
another will fly on the Japanese ADEOS mission. Pegasus XL launch delays
resulted in a two year gap in TOMS coverage following the failure of the
Meteor instrument in 1994.

Aviation Week reports that the May 12 Titan launch carried as a
secondary payload the Naval Research Laboratory's TiPS Tether Physics
and Survivability satellite. The 53 kg satellite consists of 2 end
masses connected by a 4 km tether. NRO (the National Reconnaissance
Office) provided funding for the TiPS project. Observers have seen the
TiPS payload in an 1019 x 1024 km x 63.4 deg orbit.

(The following paragraph is for satellite catalog fans only!) The status
of the different objects from the May 12 Titan launch is confused. As
best I can tell, the current official unclassified catalog states:
  Desig.    Name       SATCAT
  1996-29A  USA 119    23893
  1996-29B  USA 120    23907
  1996-29C  USA 121    23908
  1996-29D  USA 122    23862
  1996-29E  
  1996-29F
  1996-29G  Debris     23863
Possibly USA 122 is TiPS and USA 119 to 121 are the triplet satellites.
29E and 29F are then likely debris like 29G, each being a cover for one
of the triplets. However this leaves no object to be the dispenser/upper
stage. An alternative possibility is that USA 122 (or USA 119) is a
primary payload in a different orbit, 1996-29E is the dispenser/upper
stage (to get the name USA 123) and TiPS is 1996-29F and will get the
name USA 124. This is suggested by the use in the Satellite Situation
report of the name 'USA 119-124 debris' for 29G; however the weekly OIG
summary uses 'USA 119-122 debris', so '119-124' may just be a typo.


The Galileo probe successfully completed its flyby of Ganymede
on Jun 27.

Shuttle and Mir
---------------

Columbia closed its payload bay doors at 0850 UTC on Jul 7, fired its
OMS engines for the deorbit burn at 1137 UTC, and landed at 1236:45 UTC on
runway 33 at Kennedy Space Center. This was the longest Shuttle mission
to date, 16 days 21 hr 47 min 45 sec for liftoff to main gear touchdown.

Yet more errata - Helms was of course Payload Commander, not Pilot
as I said in last week's erratum; launch time was 1449:00 UTC
according to the MSFC report (my watch must have been wrong).

Atlantis was rolled back to the VAB on Jul 10 because of
Hurricane Bertha. It has not yet been decided whether to  replace the
solid boosters because of the discovery of hot gas damage in the SRB
field joints for the STS-78 launch. That could delay the launch of
STS-79 to Mir until September.

The Mir complex lowered its orbit on Jul 2 and Jul 4 to prepare for the
arrival of Soyuz TM-24 with the new Mir crew. Mir is now in a 376 x 390
km x 51.6 deg orbit; in June it had been in a 326 x 429 km x 51.6 deg
orbit. The ferry ship will be launched by a Soyuz-U rocket instead of
the uprated Soyuz-U2 usually used, and the Soyuz-U isn't powerful enough
to reach Mir's standard orbit. Apparently TM-23 also used the U model,
while earlier TM flights used the U2. (Thanks to Geoff Perry for information).

Recent Launches
---------------

China's Chang Zheng 3 (Long March 3) vehicle made a successful flight on
Jul 3 carrying a commercial US-built satellite. The Hughes HS-376 model
comsat, Apstar 1A, will provide communications relay services for  APT
(Asia Pacific Telecom) Satellite Co. of Hong Kong. The CZ-3 is an older
design than the CZ-3B rocket which failed earlier this year and the
CZ-2E model which was lost in 1995 carrying the HS-601 Apstar 2
satellite. Apstar 1A was delivered to a 225 x 42184 km x 26.93 deg
transfer orbit.


A Titan 4 rocket was launched on Jul 3 carrying a classified payload.
This Titan 4 was vehicle K-2 (45K-2), and the unidentified upper stage
motors are part of the payload. Observations indicate that the payload
may have entered an initial orbit of 293 x 318 km x 55.0 deg. It
may be a second generation Satellite Data System comsat payload, in
which case it will maneuver to an elliptical orbit.

Arianespace launched two communications satellites into
geostationary transfer orbit on Jul 9, Arabsat 2A and Turksat 1C.
The launch vehicle was the Ariane 44L variant, and was the 18th
successful launch in a row for the Ariane 4. There have been 88
launches of the Ariane 1 to 4 family of rockets, with 7 failures.

Arabsat 2A is the first of the Arabsat 2 series for the Arab Satellite
Communications Satellite Organization of the Arab League, based in Saudi
Arabia. The Aerospatiale Spacebus 3000 satellite has 22 Ku band and 12 C band
transponders.

Turksat 1C is also built by Aerospatiale and is a Spacebus 2000 model.
It will provide communications services for the Ministry of Posts and
Communications of the Republic of Turkey.

Thanks to Yoshiro Yamada for the Gorizont launch time.
TOMS was in a 340 x 943 km x 97.4 deg orbit on Jul 3.

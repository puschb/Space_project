Shuttle and Mir
---------------

Soyuz TM-24 was launched at 1318:03 UTC on Aug 17 from Kosmodrom
Baykonur in Kazakstan.  It carries the EO-24 crew of Valeriy Korzun and
Aleksandr Kaleri of the Russian Space Agency (RKA) and Claudie
Andre-Deshays of the French space agency CNES. The crew callsign is
`Fregat'. They are scheduled to dock with the Mir station on Aug 19.
Aboard Mir are Yuri Onufrienko, Yuri Usachyov and Shannon Lucid. 
This launch was the first Soyuz-U with a crew aboard since the recent
launch failures.

Onufrienko, Usachyov and Andre-Deshays will return to Earth in Soyuz
TM-23 on Sep 2, leaving Korzun, Kaleri and Lucid on the station. The
Progress M-32 cargo craft undocked from Mir on Aug 18 at 0934 UTC in
order to free up a docking port. It will remain in orbit and will redock
with Mir on Sep 3.

Atlantis is due to be rolled out to the pad on Aug 20. Meanwhile,
they have probably destacked the old external tank and SRBs,
but I haven't seen any report on this yet. Launch remains scheduled
for Sep 12.

Recent Launches
---------------

The Russian Military Space Forces (VKS) launched a Molniya-1T comsat
from 1-y GIK at Plesetsk on Aug 14 into an elliptical 12 hour orbit. The
spacecraft first entered a low parking orbit of 207 x 438 km x 62.8
degrees. The Blok-ML upper stage ignited over South America to raise the
orbit to 450 x 40800 km. The sun angle made the rocket plume widely
visible, causing a flurry of UFO reports in Chile where the
alien-invasion movie Independence Day has just opened.

There are two classes of Molniya satellite, the Molniya-1T used mainly
for Russian government communications and the Molniya-3 used for TV
signal relay across Russia. The last Molniya-1T was launched in Dec 1994
and the last Molniya-3 in Aug 1995. Since 1993 Molniya-3 satellites have
been launched once each year in August, so it's a little suprising that
this August's launch is a Molniya-1T. The Molniya satellites are
built by NPO Prikladnoi Mekhaniki of Krasnoyarsk. The first Molniya
satellite (built by the old OKB-1 Korolev bureau) was launched in 1964.

Japan's NASDA space agency launched the ADEOS Advanced Earth Observing
Satellite on Aug 17 using a large H-II launch vehicle. The third
Japanese amateur satellite, JAS-2, was also orbited. ADEOS will probably
be given a new name now it is on orbit. ADEOS has a set of instruments
including the Advanced Visible/Near IR Radiometer and the Ocean Color
and Temperature Scanner, the NASA TOMS ozone monitor and NSCAT wind
speed scatterometer, and an experiment to study greenhouse effect gases.
This was the fourth H-II launch.

China launched a Chang Zheng 3 vehicle on Aug 18 from Xichang. The CZ-3
third stage entered parking orbit and coasted, and then reignited for a
second burn to geostationary transfer orbit. However, the engine shut
down prematurely during this second burn, leaving the payload in a low
orbit. The payload is Zhongxing 7, a Hughes HS-376 class comsat for the 
China Telecommunication and Broadcasting Satellite Corporation. Launch
was at 1827 Beijing time which I believe to be 1027 UTC.

The Aug 18 planned launch of NASA's FAST satellite aboard a Pegasus was
postponed ten minutes before the expected drop time, and the L-1011
carrier plane returned to Vandenberg with the rocket still aboard.

Plesetsk History
----------------

There are officially two separate spaceports at Plesetsk in northern
Russia. Thanks to recent conversations with Igor Lissov and Maxim Tarasenko, I've
understood the history of this a little better and though I would share
it with you all.

Orbital launches from Plesetsk began in 1966. Until 1993 the spaceport's
true name was NIIP-53 (53-y Nauchno-Issledovatelskiy Ispytatelnyy
Poligon, 53rd Scientific Research Test Range). Sometime in 1993 the name
was changed to GNIIP (Gosudarstvennyy Nauchno-Issledovatelskiy
Ispytatelnyy Poligon, State Scientific Research Test Range).

The NIIP-53/GNIIP base is run by the RVSN (Strategic Rocket Forces), but
 in 1982 operation of the orbital pads was transferred to the UNKS space
troops, and in 1989 the UNKS units at Plesetsk were designated the
1278-y GTsIPKS (1278-y Glavnyy Tsentr Ispytaniy i Primeneniya
Kosmicheskikh Sredtsv). In Aug 1992 the UNKS became the VKS (Military
Space Forces of the Russian Federation). 

Then, on 1994 Nov 11 the part of GNIIP operated by the VKS, including
the GTsIPKS headquarters and the orbital launch pads, was split off
into a separate spaceport, the 1-y GIK (1-y Gosudarstvennyy Ispytatelnyy
Kosmodrom, First State Test Spaceport). GNIIP remains in existence
alongside 1-y GIK, but is used by the RVSN for ballistic missile tests.
All space launches since Nov 1994 have been from 1-y GIK by the VKS,
with the exception of the 1995 Start launch which was from GNIIP and
was carried out by the RVSN. 

This situation (two spaceports right next to each other) is not
unprecedented. From 1959 to 1964 space launches were made from a Navy
base, NMFPA (Naval Missile Facility, Point Arguello) right next to the
USAF base VAFB (Vandenberg Air Force Base). In 1965 NMFPA became part of
Vandenberg AFB. Many histories list the earlier launches as being from
`Vandenberg', but this is technically not correct. (And while I'm on a
nitpick binge, PLEASE don't spell it Vandenburg with a U!). Similarly,
the NASA John F. Kennedy Space Center (with pads 39A and 39B) is next
door to the USAF Cape Canaveral Air Station (with pads 17, 36, 40/41,
etc.). In the launch tables in this newsletter, I will continue to use
`Plesetsk' to refer to 1-y GIK, while future launches of the Start will
be labelled as being from `GNIIP'.

The Kazak spaceport Baykonur was designated NIIP-5 until 1989; since
then it has had another designation, possibly 5-y GIK but I'm not sure -
anyone who knows, please tell me. The Volgograd station at Kapustin
Yar was designated GTsP4.

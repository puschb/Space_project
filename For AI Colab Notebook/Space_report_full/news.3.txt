Jonathan's Space Report (3)

Sorry it's late...



The first US space launch of the year came on Valentine's Day.
 The first USAF Block II Navstar satellite soared into space on board
the first launch of a Delta II rocket. The fleet of Navstar Global Positioning
Satellites, when operational, will allow both military and civilian
users to determine their exact position to within a hundred metres anywhere
in the world. The satellites carry an accurate atomic clock whose rate is
corrected for the gravitational redshift predicted by General Relativity
to occur between the satellite altitude of 20000 km and the ground.
 The Delta II is a new USAF rocket and is an improved version of NASA's
Delta which has launched nearly 200 satellites over 30 years.

Preparations continue for the launch of Space Shuttle Discovery on
mission STS-29, during the week of March 13. Any further delays
are likely to result in cancellation of the mission to make way
for the STS-30 mission.

Soviet cosmonauts Volkov, Krikalyov, and Polyakov continue their
tour of duty on board the Mir space station. Last week the robot
cargo freighter Progress-39 was undocked from Mir, loaded
with refuse and surplus equipment. It was made to reenter
over the Pacific Ocean and was destroyed. A new robot freighter 
will be launched soon, carrying food, air, and fuel supplies for 
the station.

Note: I have (finally!) updated the geostationary satellite list at

Shuttle and Mir
---------------

Atlantis undocked from the Mir complex on Sep 23 at 2333 UTC. Valeriy
Korzun, Aleksandr Kaleri and John Blaha remain on Mir. On Sep 26
Atlantis closed its payload bay doors, and at 1106 UTC fired its OMS
engines for a three minute long deorbit burn. After entry interface at
1142 UTC the spaceship flew across  Canada and the US for a landing at
the Kennedy Space Center's Runway 15 at 1213 UTC, completing Shannon
Lucid's record breaking 188 day 4 hr 0 min flight. Atlantis is now being
prepared for its next mission, STS-81.

Unexpected erosion was found in the nozzle of 360T056B, STS-79's right
hand SRB, but it is not clear what effect this will have on  the next
launch scheduled for Nov 8. Mission STS-80 will deploy and retrieve the
Orfeus astronomy satellite and the Wake Shield Facility materials
processing satellite. Mission specialists Tammy Jernigan and Thomas
Jones will carry out another EDFT spacewalk to test equipment for Space
Station. As well as commander Kenneth Cockrell and pilot Kent Rominger,
the mission will carry veteran Story Musgrave who will become the second
person after John Young to make six space flights. On STS-6, Musgrave
carried out the first Shuttle spacewalk. On Mission 51-F, he carried out
experiments on the Spacelab 2 mission, which included an `abort to
orbit' during launch when an engine shut down. On Missions STS-33 and
STS-44 Musgrave helped deploy military satellites, and on Mission STS-61
he made more spacewalks to repair the Hubble Space Telescope. Musgrave
is 61 years old and will become the oldest space traveller ever, beating
the record set by 59-year-old Vance Brand in 1990. Dr. Musgrave has been a
NASA astronaut since 1967. He has a B.S. in mathematics, a B.A. in
chemistry, an MBA in operations analysis and computer programming, an
M.Sc. in  physiology, an M.A. in literature, and an M.D.. He is also a
private pilot with 17000 hours of flight time, and until 1989 combined
his job as a NASA astronaut in Houston with moonlighting as a surgeon at
Denver General Hospital and a professor of  physiology at the University
of Kentucky. Can you spell `overachiever', kids?

Recent Launches
---------------

Another successful Proton launch placed the second Ekspress comsat
in geosynchronous orbit. Ekspress replaces Gorizont as the Russian domestic
television satellite system. This satellite is probably designated
Ekspress No. 12 (Russian comsat builder Prikladnoi Mekhaniki usually starts
numbering its satellite series at 11 for reasons which escape me).
The Proton rocket is built by Krunichev, with a Blok-DM2 upper stage
designed by RKK Energiya.

Other Proton launches so far this year include two Gorizont
communications satellites, a Raduga comsat for the Russian government,
the Spektr space station module, and the commercial launches of Astra 1F
and Inmarsat III F2. Inmarsat has confirmed that the Inmarsat III F2
satellite did not carry an apogee motor. The Blok-DM upper stage
delivered F2 to geosynchronous orbit and separated 7 hours after launch.

The Ballistic Missile Defense Organization's MSX satellite
released an emissive reference sphere on Sep 12, its second subsatellite
release. The small spheres have not been cataloged by Space Command.

Obituary - IUE
--------------

The International Ultraviolet Explorer (IUE) was shut down  at 1842 UT
on 1996 Sep 30.  Prior to the final orbit raising burn, IUE was in a
1437 min, 29992 x 41616 km orbit inclined 35.9 deg. (GSFC has not yet
released post-shutdown elements). IUE was probably the most successful
scientific satellite ever.

IUE was launched in January 1978 by Delta from Cape Canaveral. The
spacecraft was a joint project between NASA Goddard Space Flight Center,
the European Space Agency, and the UK Science Research Council. It was
controlled from both Goddard and Villafranca near Madrid. The satellite
carried a small telescope and four spectrographs (two prime and two
backup) which obtained ultraviolet spectra of astronomical objects.
Exceeding its nominal six month mission duration by almost a factor of
40, IUE remained an essential scientific tool right into the 1990s. Even
the success of the HST repair mission did not remove the need for IUE,
because there are many projects, such as monitoring time variability of
bright sources, for which you need a small telescope for a long time
instead of a large telescope for a short time (and you can't get HST for
a long time!). IUE results have affected every field of astronomy, and
in particular much of our current understanding of hot stars in this
galaxy and of the inner regions of quasars is due to work with IUE. 

IUE was the first common user astronomy satellite, where any astronomer
with a good idea could apply for observing time. Because its synchronous
orbit allowed real time commanding, it remains the only satellite which
astronomers were able to use like a ground based telescope, going to the
control center and making decisions on the fly - for instance, whether
to change the length of the next exposure if the previous one was over
or under exposed. Since many ultraviolet stars and quasars vary in
brightness, so you don't know how bright they will be on the day you
observe, this is really useful - as I can testify from personal
experience as an IUE observer. You can't do that with a low orbit
satellite like HST where observations must be scheduled weeks in
advance. (Besides, having real time authority over a geosynchronous
orbit spacecraft is probably the closest I'll ever get to sitting in
Captain Picard's chair :-)). IUE was a pleasure to use, and during the
1980s was crucial to the research of many astronomers including myself.
IUE will be missed.

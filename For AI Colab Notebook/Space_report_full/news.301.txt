Shuttle and Mir
---------------


The next Shuttle launch is STS-80. The payload bay will include the
ORFEUS ultraviolet telescope on the ASTRO-SPAS free flying
satellite and the Wake Shield Facility, another free-flying satellite
which will grow crystals in vacuum and microgravity. Another
Space Station development spacewalk is planned.

Launch of the Progress M-33 cargo ship to Mir has been delayed
to early November. It will resupply Mir crewmembers Korzun, Kaleri
and Blaha.

Joel Powell points out that mission STS-79 used external tank ET-82,
not ET-81 as I said. Geoff Perry spotted my error on the undocking
time: Atlantis undocked from Mir at 0133 UTC on Sep 24.

Recent Launches
---------------

The world's launch pads have been quiet recently, so I'll take
the opportunity to talk about space history instead.

40 Years Ago: The Jupiter C and JPL Cluster Program
---------------------------------------------------

In 1953 the Redstone missile, developed by Werner Von Braun's Army
Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA) in Huntsville, Alabama, made its first
flight. Launches after Sep 1955 were designated Jupiter A, as they were
nominally in support of ABMA's Jupiter IRBM program. (Jupiter itself is
a significantly different rocket). Meanwhile, the Jet Propulsion Lab  in
Pasadena, California developed the JPL Cluster, a multi-stage clustered
rocket to be used as an upper stage velocity package. The Cluster
consisted of a Stage 2 Assembly with 11 small rocket motors known as
Scaled Sergeants or Baby Sergeants (they were  scaled down from the
design of JPL's Sergeant missile), a Stage 3 Assembly with three Scaled
Sergeants, and a Stage 4 assembly with a single Scaled Sergeant. The
Cluster was spin-stabilized and mounted on the Redstone's nose. The
initial tests of the Cluster had no Stage 4 and were known as Jupiter C,
with the first launch 40 years ago on 1956 Sep 20 achieving a world
altitude record of 1097 km.

The fourth Cluster launch on 1958 Feb 1 (UTC) placed the first US
satellite in orbit, Explorer 1. The orbital Jupiter C's were designated
Juno I. Unfortunately the available records at JPL for these launches
are patchy and I'm not certain of the Cluster unit serial number for the
historic Explorer I launch, but one diagram gives the designation
'RTV-7'. If anyone can fill in the missing Cluster designations, I'd
love to get them. The final Redstone/Cluster launch carried the Army's
Beacon balloon satellite, together with the first ever apogee motor, a
small 2 lb solid rocket. Unfortunately the Stage 2 Assembly failed and
Beacon did not reach orbit. Explorer II and V were also failures.

Following the final Juno I launch, the JPL Cluster was used as
an upper stage to the Jupiter rocket, the combination being
known as Juno II. Meanwhile, the Explorer name was used for
scientific satellites developed at NASA-Goddard and NASA-Langley.

1961 May 24   AM-19G         Cluster 20?  NASA S-45A

Cluster 14 and Cluster 15, used in the unsuccessful S-1 and Beacon 2
launch attempts, did not have an Assembly 4 stage.  S-1A was named
Explorer VII after the successful launch; S-30 became Explorer VIII, and
S-15 became Explorer XI. Pioneer IV entered solar orbit.

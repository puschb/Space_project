Shuttle and Mir
---------------

Launch of Shuttle mission STS-80 is now scheduled for Nov 19. The
orbiter Columbia carries the ORFEUS 2 ultraviolet spectrometer telescope
and the Wake Shield Facility subsatellite for making  crystals in
microgravity and high vacuum conditions. Also in the payload bay are a
series of experiments to test equipment needed for Space Station
construction, which will be used in two spacewalks during the mission.


Recent Launches
---------------

The Mars-96 spacecraft was launched on Nov 16 and is now on its way to
Mars. The last successful Mars mission was  Viking 2, which arrived at
the planet in August 1976. The NASA Mars Observer mission and the two
Soviet Fobos probes (targeted at the Martian moon Phobos) were all
failures. Now NASA's Mars Global Surveyor and the Russian Space Agency's
Mars-96 are both en route to the Red Planet, with NASA's Mars Pathfinder
due to follow next month.

The 8K82K Proton-K rocket, built by the Krunichev enterprise, took off
from pad 200L at Kosmodrom Baykonur in Kazakstan at 2048:53 UTC on Nov
16. The Proton-K is a three stage rocket. Ten minutes after launch, the
third stage separated from the payload which was at that point 145 km
high on a suborbital trajectory. The payload included a fourth stage,
the 11S824F Blok-D-2 built by RKK Energiya. The Blok-D-2 ignited at 2103
UTC and burnt out at 2105 UTC, placing itself and the attached space
vehicle in a 148 x 158 km x 51.5 deg parking orbit around the Earth. At
2157 UTC the Blok-D-2 ignited again; it cut off at 2205 UTC with the
orbit now approximately 200 x 314000 km x 51.8 deg, a very elliptical
orbit stretching almost to lunar distance. The Blok-D-2 then
separated from the Mars-96 space probe (Spacecraft M1 No. 520,
built by the Lavochkin Association). The M1 spacecraft bus is based
on the 1F spacecraft used for the Fobos missions, and includes an
ADU propulsion unit. The ADU is used both for solar orbit insertion
and for Mars orbit insertion. The ADU made its first burn just after
the Blok-D-2 separated, at 2207 UTC. At 2210 UTC the ADU shut down,
and Mars-96 was in solar orbit.

The Mars-96 space probe will arrive at Mars on 1997 Sep 12, around the
same time as Mars Global Surveyor. Four days before orbit insertion, it
will release two small landers which will descend to the planet's
surface. After Mars-96 enters Mars orbit, it will fire two penetrator
probes into the surface, and lower its orbital period to enter an
operational orbit of around 900 x 18200 km with a 12 hour orbital
period. The Mars-96 space probe is operated by IKI (the Russian Space
Research Institute) for the RKA (Russian Space Agency).

Arianespace launched an Ariane 44L from Kourou on Nov 13. The rocket
placed two satellites in geostationary transfer orbit. Arabsat 2B is an
Aerospatiale Spacebus 3000 satellite which provides communications for
the Arab League. It joins Arabsat 2A which was launched in July. Measat
2 is a Hughes HS-376 satellite, launched for the Malyasian telecom
agency Binariang Sdn. Bhd. Measat 1 was launched in January.

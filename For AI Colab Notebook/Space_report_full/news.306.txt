Shuttle and Mir
---------------

When is a spacewalk not a spacewalk? In the early days of spaceflight,
an EVA (extravehicular activity) had to be outside the spacecraft, and a
distinction was made between SEVA (standup EVA, where you didn't
entirely leave the vehicle) and a full EVA. Nowadays, NASA officially
counts EVAs from the time when astronauts are on battery power. I prefer
to ignore EVAs and instead log 'depress time', time spent working under
vacuum conditions (with a spacesuit on, of course), since this to me is
the dangerous and interesting thing. Like all the other definitions,
this one is a little fuzzy. What is the distinction between a spacesuit
and a spaceship? What is depressurized? Usually depressurization from
near full pressure (at least 10psi, US units) to vacuum (less than
0.1psi) is pretty fast, but sometimes Shuttle astronauts stick in the
airlock at around 5 psi for a while. So I try and log when they go down
from about 1 psi to zero. 

On 1996 Nov 29, STS-80 crewmembers Tamara Jernigan and Thomas Jones were
in Columbia's airlock. At 0209 UTC they depressurized, and by 0221 UTC
the airlock was fully depressurized. However, the astronauts were unable
to open the airlock due to a stuck handle. At 0307 UTC, the airlock was
partially repressurized to 4psi, and the airlock thermal cover was blown
off for inspection. After further fruitless attempts to open the hatch,
full repressurization began at 0348 and was complete at 0401, with the
astronauts still in their suits. Story Musgrave came in without a suit
and again tried to  free the hatch - this sounds scary, but interal
pressure in the airlock would have prevented a leak if he had succeeded.
NASA does not count this as an EVA, since at no time did the
astronauts go to battery power. But I log this as a depress phase,
with the astronauts getting 0h46min of depress time.

After thinking hard for a couple of days, NASA decided to cancel any
further attempts at spacewalks on this mission. There are cases where a
contingency EVA (emergency spacewalk) would be necessary, for instance
if the payload bay doors refused to close. They would try and force the
hatch open in that case. At this writing, the doors were closed and
opened again on Dec 5, closed on Dec 6 and due to open again, following
reentry attempts on Dec 5 and Dec 6 which were called off due to bad weather.

On Dec 3, Columbia began its re-rendezvous with the ORFEUS-SPAS
astronomy satellite. On Dec 4 at 0823 UTC, the astronauts retrieved the
ORFEUS-SPAS vehicle using the RMS arm.

Landing is now scheduled for Dec 7, making STS-80 the longest shuttle
mission so far at almost 18 days.

Aboard Mir, Valeriy Korzun, Aleksandr Kaleri and John Blaha are
unloading the Progress M-33 transport ship. On Dec 2 Korzun and Kaleri
made a 5h 57min space walk to install a new solar panel. They opened the
Kvant-2 hatch at 1554 UTC (no stuck hatches here!). Blaha remained
aboard the station.

Mars-96, continued: Jim Oberg reports that US Space Command now thinks
it detected the reentry of Mars-96 over the eastern Pacific and South
America, and eyewitness reports from the Atacama Desert indicate that
Mars-96 hit the ground somewhere in northern Chile or Bolivia, far from
the Blok-D-2 impact point the following day (where all the air searching
was done). At least three groups of witnesses in northern Chile,
including a former European Southern Observatory staff member, report
seeing a bright object breaking apart and changing colors at 0050 UTC on
Nov 17, consistent with the reentry time of Mars-96. Although this
evening coincided with the Leonid meteor shower, the time of night and
the speed and direction of the object rule out the possiblity of a large
Leonid-related meteorite. (Thanks to Jorge Ianisewski and Mike Keane for
passing on the eyewitness reports.)

NASA's Mars Pathfinder (MPF) space probe was successfully launched on
Dec 4 from Cape Canaveral. Pathfinder will land in Ares Vallis on 1997
Jul 4. The space probe consists of a cruise stage, an atmospheric entry
aeroshell, a lander, and the tiny Sojourner rover which will use an
x-ray spectrometer to study the composition of Martian rocks near the
landing site. The McDonnell Douglas Delta 7925 rocket took off from
Launch Complex 17B, and the second stage and payload entered a 28 degree
inclination elliptical earth parking orbit. The second stage ignited
again an hour after launch to raise orbit, followed immediately by the
third stage which propelled MPF into solar orbit. After its depletion
burn, the second stage ended up in a 148 x 3119 km x 36.4 deg orbit. MPF
was originally part of the MESUR Mars Environmental Survey; that program
was abandoned and MPF became one of the Discovery series of planetary
missions (like the NEAR asteroid probe). The companion MGS probe
launched on Nov 7 is a Mars Surveyor, which is technically a separate
NASA program.

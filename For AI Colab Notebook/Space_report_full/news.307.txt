Shuttle and Mir
---------------

The Boeing North American (formerly Rockwell) Space Shuttle Orbiter
OV-102 Columbia landed at 1149 UTC Dec 7 on Runway 33 at Kennedy Space
Center, making STS-80 the longest shuttle mission so far at 17 days 15
hr 53 min.

The next Shuttle mission is STS-81/Atlantis, which will fly to Mir in
January. Atlantis was rolled out to pad 39B on Dec 10.

Kaleri and Korzun made their second spacewalk at 1352 UTC on Dec 9, with
hatch closure after 6h 36 min. 


Recent Launches
---------------

A Russian defense ministry US-P electronic ocean reconnaissance
satellite was launched from the GIK-5 Baykonur spaceport, Area 90, on
Dec 11. The launch vehicle was the 11K69 Tsiklon-2, built by the
Ukranian Yuzhnoe (Dnepropetrovsk) company. The satellite was named
Kosmos-2335 after launch into a 403 x 418 km x 65.0 deg orbit. Contrary
to some press reports, this satellite is not an optical imaging recon
satellite.

The third Inmarsat 3 satellite was launched by Lockheed Martin Atlas
AC-129 on Dec 17. Inmarsat 3 F3 is a Lockheed Martin Telecommunications
Series 4000 class communications satellite which provides L-band
communications for maritime and aviation users. It is owned by the
International Maritime Satellite Organization. The Atlas IIA's Centaur
second stage placed Inmarsat 3 F3 in a conventional (although
high-perigee) 1017 x 35820 km x 22.7 deg geostationary transfer orbit.
The solid motor was fired prior to Dec 20, placing the satellite in a
35652 x 35951 km x 3.4 deg geosynchronous drift orbit.

A large imaging recon satellite for the US National Reconnaissance Office was
launched on Dec 20. Launch vehicle was a Lockheed Martin Titan 4, serial
K-13, and the payload may have been an Improved Crystal recon satellite.

Kosmos-2336, a navigation satellite for the Russian navy, was launched
by Kosmos-3M from Plesetsk on Dec 20. Orbit is 979 x 1012 km x 82.9 deg.
The satellite and launch vehicle are both built by AO Polyot of Omsk.

US Corporate Mergers
--------------------

I don't normally track this stuff in the newsletter, but it's gotten
so confusing lately I though readers might like a scorecard. 
The old North American Aviation (X-15, Apollo) which became Rockwell
(Shuttle Orbiter, GPS) is now Boeing North American. The old
Douglas (Thor) and McDonnell (Gemini), which became McDonnell Douglas 
(Skylab, Delta) has announced it will also merge with Boeing, creating
an aerospace company to rival Lockheed Martin. Lockheed Martin encompasses
a variety of companies from the pioneering days: Lockheed (Corona, Agena,
Hubble), Martin (Titan; later Martin Marietta - Viking, NOSS), Convair
(later General Dynamics; Atlas, Centaur), GE (Nimbus, Landsat), RCA
(Tiros, DMSP, Astro Space comsats) among others.

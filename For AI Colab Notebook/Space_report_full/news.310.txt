Shuttle and Mir
---------------

Atlantis was launched at 0928 UTC on Jan 12 from pad 39B. Solid rocket booster
came at 0930 UTC. The orbiter entered a 51.6 degree inclination
orbit around the Earth at 0936 UTC.

Atlantis will dock with the Mir orbital
station, and NASA astronaut Jerry Linenger will replace John Blaha.
Russian astronauts Valeriy Korzun and Aleksandr Kaleri will remain on
the station.
             
Recent Launches
---------------

The Bion No. 11 spacecraft landed near Kustanai on Jan 7.
One of the two monkeys, Multik, died a day later from
unspecified causes.

Geostationary Transfer Orbits
-----------------------------

Some recent comsat launches have used an extremely high apogee
transfer orbit with subsequent apogee lowering to reach their
final orbits. The following article is an attempt to put this
new orbital technique in context.

The first geostationary satellite was Syncom 3, launched in August 1964
into a 1113 x 38084 km x 16.80 deg, 694.5 min transfer orbit. A solid
motor was used to circularize the orbit at 36000 km. The perigee of
Syncom 3's transfer orbit was unusually high; between 1970 and 1990,
almost all geostationary satellites used transfer orbits with perigees
between 150 and 600 km, and apogees from 34000 to 41000 km. 

During the 1980s the use of liquid propellant apogee engines  (LAEs)
began to supersede the older solid rocket apogee motors (AKMs), but it
was not until the 1990s that the greater flexibility of the LAE was
fully exploited, most notably in Atlas Centaur launches. A number of
transfer orbit techniques are now in use.

To classify transfer orbits, I consider the first orbit entered by the
spacecraft with an apogee above 5000 km (i.e. the first burn after any
initial low parking orbit). Thus, the Astra 1F Proton launch in 1996
used a standard GTO of 220 x 36131 x 51.6 for its initial transfer
orbit, but the final stage made an extra burn leaving the payload in a
11970 x 35936 x 7.0 orbit. In similar Ariane missions, the final stage
would separate in the standard GTO orbit and the LAE first burn would
leave the payload in the 12000 km perigee orbit. I don't care whether
this extra burn is made by the launch vehicle or the payload, I am
focussing on the initial transfeer orbit which in this case is the 220
km perigee one. With this proviso, the different transfer orbits
in use can be usefully grouped as follows (names and arbitrary
dividing lines are my invention:)

(1) Standard GTO: 150-700 x 34000-41000. Still used by
almost all Ariane, H-II and Chang Zheng launches.

(2) High perigee GTO (HP-GTO): 700-4000 x 34000-41000. This
type of orbit was used by Syncom 3 and Early Bird and then abandoned
in favour of lower perigees. It appears to have been used
by some Titan 34D/Transtage classified missions beginning in 1984,
and came back into regular use with the first flight of the
Delta 7925 in 1991. All Delta 7925 geostationary missions
have had transfer orbit perigees between 700 and 3000 km.
Three Atlas launches have also used a high perigee GTO: Galaxy V (1992-13),
Inmarsat III F-1 (1996-20) and F-3 (1996-70).

(3) Low-GTO: Apogees below 30000 km. For these missions, a perigee
motor places the spacecraft in an orbit with an intermediate apogee
well below geostationary, and subsequent LAE burns are used to reach GEO.
Introduced by the LEASAT/SYNCOM IV spacecraft in 1984, they have
also been used by a Titan JCSAT launch and the UHF and Galaxy 
missions with HS-601 satellites: (UHF F/O F1 was also intended for this orbit
but failed).

(4) Sub-GTO: Apogees between 30000 and 34000 km. A different compromise
between final stage and LAE fuel loading, I treat these missions as
different from the Low-GTO ones since only a small burn is needed to
reach final altitude, although it could be argued that 25000 km would be
a better dividing line. The only such mission launched to date is
DBS 3 in 1995, although two earlier non-GEO science satellites used
such orbits as their final mission orbits.

(5) High-GTO: super-synchronous transfer orbits with apogees between
41000 km and 50000 km. These orbits have the advantage that, since the
apogee velocity is lower, inclination changes take less fuel (the low
initial inclination of Ariane launches is presumably the reason that
standard GTO is fine for them). Apogee is then lowered after the plane
change. Some USAF classified launches in the CANYON and VORTEX programs
have used marginally high apogees around 41000 km, but their final
orbits were elliptical and no apogee lowering was required. Two
scientific satellites in near-geosynchronous orbits, IUE and SCATHA,
also used high apogees. The GOES weather satellites were the first
operational geostationary satellites to use such transfer orbits, with
apogees around 50000 km, starting with GOES 4 in 1980. Since then, three
commercial satellites (Eutelsat II F3 and two Apstars, on Atlas and
CZ-3) have used such orbits.

(5) Super-GTO. The truly spectactular super-synchronous transfer orbits
used by some recent commercial satellites reach apogees previously only explored
by deep space research probes. The first highly eccentric GTO mission was
the Intelsat 603 satellite, launched from LEO in May 1992 following its
repair by astronauts on mission STS-49. It reached an apogee of over 70000 km.
This was followed by the Orion 1 satellite in 1974, which reached a
record-breaking 120000 km, almost a third of the way to the Moon.
I also include the scientific ISO satellite in the list below.

Shuttle and Mir
---------------

Atlantis docked with Mir at 0355 UTC on Jan 15. Jerry Linenger has
replaced John Blaha on the Mir crew. The Shuttle undocked from the SO
module on Mir at 0216 UTC on Jan 20, and backed off along the -RBAR
(i.e. toward the Earth) to a distance of 140m before beginning a
flyaround at 0231 UTC. Most of the flyaround was at a distance from Mir
of about 170m. The first 'orbit' around Mir was complete at 0315, and
the second was completed at 0402 UTC, when the Orbiter fired its
jets to separate from the vicinity of Mir. The return crew for
Atlantis comprised Mike Baker, Brent Jett, Marsha Ivins, Jeff Wisoff,
John Grunsfeld, and John Blaha.

Atlantis closed its payload bay doors early on Jan 22 and fired the OMS
engines for the deorbit burn at 1317 UTC. The spaceship touched down on
Runway 33 at Kennedy Space Center at 1422 UTC, completing mission
STS-81. Atlantis will make its next trip to Mir in May.

The next Shuttle mission, STS-82 on Feb 11, will deliver new science
instruments to the Hubble Space Telescope. Discovery was rolled to the
pad on Jan 17; during the rollout, the steel surface plate of Mobile
Launch Platform 1 developed a 7 meter long crack, with a 'loud bang'.
NASA reports that the weight-bearing surface of the MLP, which supports
the fully fuelled Shuttle, is intact and there is apparently no big
problem. Mobile Launch Platform 1 was originally part of Apollo-Saturn
Launch Umbilical Tower 3 (LUT-3), first rolled out to pad 39A in March
1966 and first used for a launch for Apollo 10 in May 1969.

Recent Launches
---------------

A McDonnell Douglas Delta 7925 was destroyed shortly after launch from
Cape Canaveral on Jan 17. According to a Florida Today report, a solid
rocket booster may have failed just before the spectacular explosion.
This is the first Delta II rocket to fail to reach orbit, and the first
failure to orbit of any Delta since 1986. The payload was the first GPS
Block IIR spacecraft to be launched (actually the second production
vehicle), built by the former Lockheed Martin Astro Space in Valley
Forge, Pennsylvania. (now part of Lockheed Martin Missiles and
Space/Sunnyvale). Navstar GPS satellites carry atomic clocks to provide
precise navigational information; Boeing North American Block II and
Block IIA GPS satellites make up the current system, which Block IIR
will replace.

The Delta 7925 is a three stage rocket. The first stage is an Extra
Extended Long Tank Thor, a derivative of the 1950s Thor IRBM. The second
stage is a restartable liquid stage, usually denoted 'SSPS' for Second
Stage Propulsion System, and using the Aerojet AJ-10-118K engine. This
stage derives from the AJ-10-118E Improved Delta stage of the mid-1960's
which in turn came from the AJ-10-104 Ablestar stage. The third stage is
the PAM-D (Payload Assist Module-Delta) which uses the Thiokol Star 48
solid motor. In addition to the three main stages, there are nine
strap-on solid motors attached to the first stage. These Alliant
Techsystems GEM (Graphite Epoxy Motor) solids distinguish the Delta 7000
series from earlier models using Thiokol Castor solid boosters. The only
GEM failure to date occurred when a GEM failed to separate during the
Koreasat 1 launch, but it appears that one of the GEMs may have failed
on this latest launch.

AT&T's Telstar 401 communications satellite has failed in geostationary
orbit. Reason for the failure is unknown. The satellite was built
by Lockheed Martin Astro Space/East Windsor and is a Series 7000 model.

Shuttle Processing Explanation (or,  what are all these acronyms
anyway?): 

 The Shuttle consists of an Orbiter (OV), an expendable External Tank
(ET), and a reusable pair of Redesigned Solid Rocket Motors (RSRM).  It
is launched from Kennedy Space Center (KSC). The OV is prepared for
flight in the Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF) which consists of three
bays (one of which is actually a separate building) after which it is
towed to the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) and `mated to the stack' or
joined to the ET and RSRM. First, the segments of the RSRM are stacked
up on a Mobile Launch Platform (ML) and then the ET is connected to it.
After the OV is mated, a Crawler-Transporter is moved underneath the ML
and carries the ML/RSRM/ET/OV stack to one of the two pads (A or B) at
launch complex 39 (LC39) where it is eventually launched on a Space
Transportation System (STS) mission. Occasionally an OV is returned to
the Rockwell International plant in Palmdale, California for refit - an
Orbiter Maintenance Down Period or OMDP.

Shuttle and Mir
---------------

Discovery completed its rendezvous with Hubble on Feb 13. Steve Hawley
used the RMS arm to grapple HST at 0834 UTC and by shortly after 0900
UTC the telescope was docked to the FSS (Flight Support Structure) in
the aft part of the cargo bay. On Feb 14 astronauts Mark Lee and Steven
Smith carried out a spacewalk to install the STIS and NICMOS science
instruments. After depressurizing the airlock to 5 psi, the spacewalk
was postponed when escaping air caused the Hubble solar arrays to move.
Depressurization was completed at around 0430 UTC. First, the GHRS
spectrograph was removed from its axial bay on HST and parked on the
ORUC carrier. Then, the STIS spectrograph was removed from its ORUC
enclosure and placed inside HST. GHRS was placed in the empty enclosure
for return to Earth. Now it was the turn of the Faint Object
Spectrograph (FOS, my personal favorite HST instrument which has
generated loads of delicious data on the ultraviolet spectra and
continua of quasars) to be retired. It was removed from its axial bay
and parked, to be replaced by the NICMOS infrared camera/spectrograph
brought up in the SAC carrier (used to carry up new solar panels on
STS-61). Finally FOS was laid in the NICMOS enclosure on SAC for its
journey home to honorable retirement. According to Bill Harwood's web page,
the airlock close was at 1116 UTC, but I don't have the repressurization
time.

HST's science compartment has radial bays, accessed from the side, and
axial bays, accessed from the end. The radial bays contain three Fine
Guidance Sensors, FGS-1 to FGS-3 (FGS-1 was replaced on this
mission), and the WFPC-2 Wide Field and Planetary Camera, responsible
for the majority of the pretty pictures you see. The axial bays, whose
boundaries are rotated 45 degrees to the radial bays, contain the Faint
Object Camera (FOC), which takes ultraviolet pictures, the COSTAR device
which carries corrective lenses for FOC, and the new NICMOS and STIS.
COSTAR also provided spectacles for GHRS and FOS, but NICMOS and STIS
have their own corrective optics. FOS is the only one of the original
science (non-FGS) instruments still aboard. The High Speed Photometer
was replaced by COSTAR, and the original WFPC was replaced by WFPC-2.

The spacewalkers have discovered potentially serious rips in Hubble's 
insulation, caused by degradation over the seven years the material
has been in orbit. An orbital debris puncture in an antenna
was also noticed.

Four more spacewalks have now been completed. EVA-2, by Greg Harbaugh
and Joe Tanner, replaced the Fine Guidance Sensor in a 7h 26m spacewalk.
EVA-3, by Lee and Smith, made a 7h 11m walk to install a new computer
and data recorder. EVA-4 was 6h 34m and saw installation of new
electronics and covers on the magnetometer sensors, plus initial repairs
to the insulation. EVA-5 involved more insulation repairs; the
astronauts then spent some time in the airlock awaiting word on whether
an extra gyro replacement would be needed, before finally cleaning up
the payload bay and repressurizing after a 5h 17m walk. (The times given
are NASA's EVA times from when the spacesuits go on battery power until
repressurization; I prefer to measure from depressurization to
repressurization, which gives times about 5 minutes longer in each
case).

The Hubble Space Telescope was released back into orbit at  0641 UTC on
Feb 19. Discovery landed on Runway 15 at Kennedy Space Center at
0832 UTC on Feb 21.

Recent Launches
---------------

An 11K68 Tsiklon-3 rocket built by the Ukrainian Dnepropetrovsk company
Yuzhnoe was launched from Plesetsk in Russia on Feb 14. The S5M third
stage fired twice to enter a circular 1400 km orbit and deployed six
small communications satellites built by NPO Prikladnoi Mekhaniki of
Krasnoyarsk, Russia. The names of the satellites are not yet confirmed
but I am guessing that three are Kosmos military satellites in the
Strela-3 system for the Russian Federation Ministry of Defense (MO RF)
and three are development satellites for the Gonets civilian version of
Strela-3, which is probably officially owned by the Russian Space Agency
(RKA). The first satellite is in a 1413 x 1422 km x 82.6 deg orbit;
orbits for the others are similar.

JCSAT 4 was launched by a Lockheed Martin Astronautics/Denver Atlas IIAS
from Cape Canaveral on Feb 17. JCSAT 4 is a communications satellite
owned by Japan Satellite Systems Inc (JSAT, Kabushiki-gaisha Nihon
Sateraito Sisutemuzu). It is an HS-601 class satellite built by Hughes.
The Atlas IIAS AC-127 Centaur second stage entered a low parking orbit
and then reignited to place JCSAT-4 in a Super-GTO orbit of 221 x 94251
km x 23.5 deg. The HS-601's liquid apogee engine will change inclination
to equatorial, then lower the apogee and raise  perigee to achieve
geostationary orbit. By Feb 20, it was in a 14339 x 94291 km x 6.5 deg
orbit.

Galileo completed its orbit 6 Europa encounter  on Feb 20. It flew 587
km from Europa. Its next orbit will take it past Ganymede on Apr 5.
The Haruka satellite has now raised its perigee to 500 km.

Editorial
---------
Apologies for the delay in this report. I've been very busy at work
(for which see the AXAF article below).

Shuttle and Mir
---------------

After the failure of Progress M-33 to redock with Mir, it was deorbited
at 0235 UTC on Mar 12 and reentered at 0323 UTC over the Pacific Ocean.

The next Shuttle launch is STS-83, scheduled for launch Apr 3 using
OV-102 Columbia. It carries a Spacelab Long Module (probably the CD
module, Flight Unit 1, which last flew on STS-73/USML-2 - can anyone
confirm this?) and an Extended Duration Orbiter pallet. The Spacelab
payload is MSL-1 (Microgravity Science Laboratory 1). This is actually
the second payload called MSL-1 to fly on the Shuttle, as the STS-7
OSTA-2 payload was also called MSL-1. An MSL-2 flew on mission 61-C in
1986. The earlier MSL-1 and MSL-2 are nothing to do with the new ones.
Crew of STS-83 are James Halsell and Susan Still (Commander and Pilot),
Janice Voss (Payload Commander), Mike Gernhardt and Donald Thomas
(Mission Specialists), and Roger Crouch and Gregory Linteris (Payload
Specialists). Cady Coleman is backup to Thomas, who broke his ankle
during training, but it now looks like Thomas will be OK to fly.
Crouch is a NASA HQ employee, and was backup on IML-1. Linteris works
at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

OV-105 Endeavour returned to Kennedy Space Center on Mar 27 after its
refurbishment period at Boeing North American in California.
It was scheduled to take up the first Shuttle payload to Space
Station on STS-88, but the mission has now been postponed and
the manifest is being reworked.

AXAF
----

The Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility is NASA's next
observatory-class astronomy satellite. It is due for launch in Aug 1998
on Shuttle OV-102 Columbia. A two-stage IUS will place it in a highly
elliptical orbit, and an onboard liquid propulsion system will then
raise the orbit to 10000 x 140000 km x 28.5 deg. The telescope has a ten
meter focal length. Two cameras (ACIS, which contains ten X-ray CCD
imagers based on ASCA/SIS technology, and HRC, which has four
microchannel plate pairs similar to the ROSAT/HRI but much bigger)
will detect the X-rays, and two gratings may be placed in the beam
for high resolution spectroscopy. AXAF will make high spatial and
spectral resolution observations of X-ray sources such as quasars,
clusters of galaxies, supernova remnants, binary and active stars,
and even comets.

Prime contractor TRW, which is building the spacecraft in California,
has completed structural tests of the spacecraft bus and fit checks of
the telescope tube. Meanwhile in Alabama, scientists from NASA's
Marshall Space Flight Center, the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory,
MIT, Penn State, Utrecht and MPE/Garching are calibrating the telescope
and its science instruments. In a recent press release we announced that
mirror tests show we can focus 70 percent of the X-rays from a point
source into an image half an arcsecond across, which is much better than
X-ray telescopes now on orbit. This is very exciting news, confirming
that we've constructed the mirrors correctly; next we test the mirrors
in combination with the flight cameras. The calibration tests began in
December and have been running 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The
telescope is in a two-story-high vacuum chamber at NASA-MSFC, and
scientists from here are taking turns going down for a week or two to do
12-hour shifts overseeing the operations and data reduction. 

Recent Launches
---------------

The Tempo 2 direct broadcast satellite was launched by Lockheed Martin's
Atlas IIA AC-128 from Cape Canaveral on Mar 8. Tempo is owned by TCI
Satellite Entertainment Inc and is a Space Systems/Loral FS-1300 class
spacecraft. The Centaur IIA second stage made two burns to place
Tempo 2 in a sub-synchronous 369.9 min, 256 x 21125 km x 25.0 deg
transfer orbit. It used its own engine to raise orbit to geosynchronous,
and on Mar 27 it was on station at 109.9W.

Based on info from Ron Pedersen, I understand that that the Intelsat 8
satellites (like Intelsat 801 launched on Mar 1) use the British Royal
Ordnance Leros 1 apogee engine.

Erratum: Igor Lissov reports that he believes earlier reports that the
Zeya satellite  is the same as the Mozhaets satellite are incorrect. So
I don't know for sure who built Zeya, although NPO-PM is probably
still the contractor and the Russian Defense Ministry is the owner.
It may be primarily for communications rather than navigation/geodesy.
Zeya is in a 424 x 467 km x 97.3 deg orbit. If anyone has any more
details on Zeya, please let me know.

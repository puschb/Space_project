Shuttle and Mir
---------------

Shuttle mission STS-83 was launched from Kennedy Space Center at
approximately 1920:36 UTC on Apr 4. The orbiter is OV-102 Columbia;
solid rocket motors RSRM-59 separated two minutes after launch and the
external tank ET-84 was jettisoned at 1929 UTC, leaving Columbia in an
elliptical transfer orbit with an apogee near 300 km. The OMS 2 orbit
circularization burn was scheduled for 2000 UTC. Launch was delayed
for 20 minutes due to minor technical problems.

The Microgravity Science Lab 1 (MSL-1) mission carries the
following payloads in its cargo bay:
 Bay 1-2: Airlock Tunnel Adapter
 Bay 3-5: Spacelab Long Tunnel
 Bay 4 Starboard: CRYOFD
 Bay 6-10: Spacelab Long Module, Flight Unit 1
 Bay 11 keel: OARE
 Bay 12:  EDO Kit (Extended Duration Orbiter pallet)

The Long Module laboratory is a reusable space vehicle which has flown
in space seven times previously, almost always aboard orbiter OV-102
Columbia:

 Long Module 1 flights
 1983 Spacelab 1                        (Columbia)
 1985 Spacelab 3                        (Challenger)
 1991 Spacelab Life Sciences 1          (Columbia)
 1992 US Microgravity Lab 1             (Columbia)
 1993 Spacelab D-2                      (Columbia)
 1994 International Microgravity Lab 2  (Columbia)
 1995 US Microgravity Lab 2             (Columbia)
 1997 Microgravity Science Lab 1        (Columbia)

There is a second Long Module which has flown six times, on
every single orbiter in NASA's fleet:

 Long Module 2 flights
 1985 Spacelab D-1                       (Challenger)
 1992 International Microgravity Lab 1   (Discovery)
 1992 Spacelab J                         (Endeavour)
 1993 Spacelab Life Sciences 2           (Columbia)
 1995 Spacelab-Mir                       (Atlantis)
 1996 Life Science/Microgravity Spacelab (Columbia)
 1998, planned: Neurolab                 (Columbia)

On this MSL-1 mission, Long Module 1 carries a number of experiment
racks including a test flight of the International Standard Payload Rack
which is to be used on Space Station. On this mission the ISPR is called
EXPRESS, is installed in module Rack 7, and carries a plant growth
experiment and a fluid physics experiment. Rack 3 contains the TEMPUS
electromagnetic levitation facility and two acceleration monitoring
systems. Another set of racks comprises the Combustion Module (Rack 6,
Rack 8) which will be used for experiments in microgravity combustion
(setting fire to things in space). The Large Isothermal Furnace (Rack 9)
will conduct experiments with metallic liquids. The Drop Combustion
Experiment (Rack 10) has another fire experiment. Rack 12 is the
misleadingly named Middeck Glovebox, which used to fly on the orbiter
mid-deck but now is in the Long Module, and carries more materials
experiments.

The OARE Orbiter Acceleration Research Experiment is an instrument
attached to the bottom of the cargo bay, which has flown on many
previous Columbia missions. It measures the acceleration environment
of the Shuttle, which is particularly important on a microgravity
experiment mission.

The CRYOFD (Cryogenic Flexible Diode) payload is mounted on an adapter
beam on the payload bay wall. It consists of the Hitchhiker avionics box
and a Getaway Special type canister containing two experimental heat
pipes. Heat pipes are devices used to passively remove heat from
electronics on spacecraft.

Technical problems with the life support systems and thermal control
systems continue on board Mir. The carbon dioxide removal system failed
on  Apr 3. Launch of a supply craft, Progress M-34, with repair
equipment for the oxygen systems, is scheduled for Apr 6.

Recent Launches
---------------

A Defense Meteorological Satellite Program weather satellite for the US
Air Force was launched on Apr 4 from Vandenberg. The payload is probably
satellite 5D S-14 (Satellite no. 14) and will become 5D F-14 (Flight no.
14) now it is up. Earlier Block 5D satellites were launched on
refurbished Thor and Atlas ICBMs; this time was DMSP's first use of a  a
two-stage refurbished Titan II ICBM. The  Titan 23G-6 rocket separated
from the payload six minutes after launch and delivered the DMSP and its
integral Star 37 solid motor upper stage into a suborbital trajectory
over the Pacific. The Star 37 was due to fire at apogee to place DMSP in
an 800 km sun-synchronous orbit.

The Block 5D program is a classic example of the disease of designation
asymptotia. The Block 5A satellites introduced in 1970 were
significantly larger than their Block 4B precursors but were the same
basic shape. Block 5B and 5C were minor upgrades to the 5A design. Block
5D, however, was a completely and utterly different spacecraft and
should really have been called Block 6. Since then the design has been
upgraded to a 5D-2 variant (should have been at least Block 6B if not
Block 7) and the next launch will be a 5D-3. Thank goodness, a Block 6
is finally on the drawing boards, although at this point I wouldn't be
surprised if they decided to rename it 5D-3-B. By the way, for some
incomprehensible reason the Block 1 to Block 3 series weather satellites
of 1962-1965 are still classified.

The Zeya satellite is an 87 kg small satellite possibly based on the
Strela-1M military comsat bus launched in octuplets during the 1970s and
1980s. It carries 20 laser reflectors for geodesy and GLONASS and GPS
navigation receivers (*not* transmitters) presumably for orbital
determination to support its geodesy mission. Zeya also carries the
RS-16 amateur radio payload with 29.4 MHz, 435 MHz and 145.8 MHz
antennae. Thanks to Eric Rosenberg and Vladimir Agapov for the info.
Peter Klanowski reports that Itar-Tass (Jan 23) says Zeya was "
developed by the Krasnoyarsk-26 applied mechanics research and
production association [i.e. NPO-PM - ed.] jointly with the  Mozhaisky
military space engineering academy on order from the military  space
forces in the interests of the Russian Defence Ministry."

Shuttle and Mir
---------------

STS-83 performed its OMS 2 orbit circularization burn at 2000 UTC on Apr
4, and Columbia opened its payload bay doors by 2109 UTC, beginning what
was intended as a marathon Spacelab research mission. However, one of
the orbiter's three fuel cells malfunctioned shortly after launch, and
flight rules require that all three must be operating. The fuel cells
combine hydrogen and oxygen to make water and electricity. At 1430 UTC
on Apr 6 the crew were ordered to begin a Minimum Duration Flight (MDF).
On Apr 8 the OMS engines ignited at 1730 UTC for the deorbit burn, and
Columbia landed on Runway 33 at Kennedy Space Center at 1833 UTC.

While this foreshortened mission must be counted as a failure, we should
remember that in 82 orbital flights this is only the second that has had
to be abandoned well short of its goal, the first being STS-2 in 1981.
(A third flight, STS-44, was cut short by three days of its planned ten,
but in that case the primary mission objectives had already been met).
Some observers have noted that NASA has been a lot readier in recent
years to grant waivers (exceptions) to flight rules `on the fly', I
think mainly because flight controllers feel they now have the
experience to know what they can safely get away with. The fact that
they didn't consider stretching the rules this time, despite the serious
consequences, is an encouraging sign that safety is still the top
priority.

Endeavour was moved temporarily to the VAB on Apr 8 in order to free up
a parking space for Columbia in the Orbiter Processing Facility.
Columbia is currently scheduled to make its next flight as STS-87 in
October, but there is a possibility that an STS-83R reflight could be
added to the schedule in July.

A Progress cargo ship, production no. 234, was launched from Baykonur on
Apr 6 at 1604 UTC and named Progress M-34. It carries supplies for the
Mir station and repair equipment for Mir's oxygen generators, as well as
replacement oxygen-generating 'candles' and a pair of new spacesuits for
a forthcoming spacewalk. Progress M-34 docked successfully with the
Kvant module on Mir at 1730 UTC on Apr 8. Tsibliev, Lazutkin and
Linenger have begun repairs to Mir.

Recent Launches
---------------

Kosmos-2340 was launched on an 8K78M Molniya-M rocket on Apr 9 from the
Military Space Forces' Plesetsk spaceport. It is an early warning
satellite of the Oko series, which operate in 12-hour elliptical orbits
inclined at 62.8 degrees. The satellite is built by the Lavochkin
company and the rocket is provided by TsSKB-Progress. 

I have confirmed that the DMSP satellite launched on  Apr 4 was
spacecraft serial number S-14. The launch date for F-9/S-8 was actually
1988 Feb 3, apologies for the typo. It has been suggested to me that the
perverse DMSP-5D-2 style of block naming was done to keep a low profile
for both security and bureaucratic reasons. I goofed also in mentioning
a possible DMSP Block 6 - the DMSP and civilian NOAA weather sat
programs are being merged into something called NPOESS instead.

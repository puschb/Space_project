I have updated my edited version of the United Nations Registry of space objects,
available from my space home page http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~jcm/space/space.html.

Shuttle and Mir
---------------

NASA has decided to go ahead with mission STS-83R, the MSL-1 reflight,
on July 1. The same crew will fly the mission. The solid rocket boosters
originally scheduled for STS-85 (BI-88/RSRM-62) are being stacked
instead for STS-83R on mobile launch platform 1 in the VAB's high bay 1.
Meanwhile, preparations continue for the launch of Atlantis on mission
STS-84 to Mir in May, and that orbiter has been connected to the
external tank and solid rocket boosters. Atlantis will deliver a
replacement oxygen generator to Mir. The Mir complex raised its orbit by
5 km on 15 Apr at 1200 UTC, using Progress M-34's engine. The Mir crew
continue to carry out repairs on their life support system.

Recent Launches
---------------

Arianespace's Ariane 44LP rocket placed two communications satellites
into orbit on Apr 16. Thaicom 3 is an Aerospatiale Spacebus 3000
satellite with 25 C-band and 14 Ku-band transponders, owned by
Shinawatra Satellite Public Co. of Bangkok, Thailand. It will be used
for communications in Asia and direct TV coverage in Thailand. The
satellite has a mass of 2650 kg at launch, 1179 kg dry, with a 26.3m
solar panel wingspan. The second payload is BSAT-1a, a Ku-band direct TV
broadcasting satellite using the Hughes HS-376 bus. It is operated by
Broadcasting Satellite System Corp. of Tokyo, a consortium of Japanese
broadcasters including NHK, which will replace the earlier TSCJ
(Telecomms Sat Corp of Japan) as the DBS operating organization. BSAT-1a
is a successor to the BSE, BS-2a/b, BS-3a/b (Yuri) satellite series of
NASDA and the BS-2X, 3H, 3N series of NHK.

Kosmos-2341 was launched on Apr 17. It is a navigation satellite built
by NPO-PM of Krasnoyarsk-26. The AO Polyot Kosmos-3M launch vehicle's
S3M upper stage made two burns to deliver the payload to a 977 x 1014 km
x 82.9 deg orbit. The FAISAT satellite originally scheduled for this
mission was removed prior to launch.

Orbital Sciences Corp. launched a Pegasus XL rocket on Apr 21,
placing the Minisat-01 satellite in orbit for the Instituto
Nacional de Tecnica Aerospacial (INTA), the Spanish space agency.
Minisat-01 is the first of a series of Minisat-0 technology
satellites, which will precede planned Minisat-1 observation
satellites and Minisat-2 comsats. Minisat-01 is a 209 kg satellite
built by the Spanish CASA company. It carries the EURD extreme
ultraviolet spectrograph to study the interstellar medium, the
LEGRI experiment to study gamma ray bursts, and the CPLM
experiment to study microaccelerations in liquids.

The Pegasus XL rocket was attached to OSC's L-1011 Stargazer launch
aircraft at Torrejon AFB, Madrid earlier this month. On Apr 19 the
L-1011 carried the Pegasus to Gando AFB on the eastern tip of the island
of Gran Canaria, at approximately 27.5N 15.2W. It took off again at 1100
UTC on Apr 21, flying to 11.9 km altitude over the drop zone at 27.0N
15.33W, over the Atlantic Ocean between Gran Canaria and the Western
Sahara coast. The Pegasus XL was released at 1159 UTC and five seconds
later the winged first stage ignited to begin the ascent to orbit. The
second stage burnt out at 1202 UTC and the vehicle coasted until 1207
UTC when the second stage separated and the third stage ignited for a
one minute burn. At 1209 UTC the third stage and Minisat-01 separated,
with Minisat in a 562 x 581 km orbit with an inclination of 151.0 degrees
(i.e. 29 degrees but going westward). This is an all-time record high
inclination orbit, beating the 1966 record of 144.7 deg set by the USAF
research satellite OV1-5. 

Some press reports said that this Pegasus launch was the first satellite
launch from Western Europe, a claim that suggests certain people need to
look at a map. It's true that the mission was staged via Madrid and some
operations were managed from there, but the takeoff was from Gando and I
understand that launch control was at Maspalomas on the southern tip of
Gran Canaria. It's also true that Gran Canaria is Spanish territory
(just as Kourou is French territory), but that doesn't make it part of
Europe. So I think it's more accurate to say that this was a launch from
Western Africa (and not the first, as the French launched from southern
Algeria in 1965-1967. The Italian launch site off the coast of East
Africa saw its first orbital launch in 1967).

The Pegasus third stage for this mission consistes of an Orion 38
rocket motor and the Celestis satellite. The Celestis is a set of
capsules containing the cremated ashes of 24 people, and inaugurates
a new form of burial provided by the U.S. company Celestis, Inc.
Celestis is in a 554 x 582 km x 151.0 deg orbit.

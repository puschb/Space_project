Editorial
---------

As part of research for a paper on the history of solid rocket motors,
I have compiled a launch log of all solid motors used as launch vehicle
final stages and apogee motors. I'd be grateful to anyone who can
provide corrections or fill in omissions. The log is available at
 http://hea-www.harvard.edu/QEDT/jcm/space/rockets/notes.html

Shuttle and Mir
---------------

Atlantis was rolled out to pad 39A on Apr 24 in preparation for the
launch of STS-84 on May 15. STS-83R has been renamed STS-94; the
missions up to STS-93 were far enough along in planning that it would
have been inconvenient to change all their documentation. Columbia will
have the same crew and cargo as before, and will launch on Jul 1.

Vasiliy Tsibliev and Jerry Linenger donned their Orlan-DMA spacesuits
and made a 5 hour spacewalk on Apr 29. They left the airlock at 0510 UTC
and returned to Kvant-2 at 1008 UTC after 4h 57m. The astronauts
retrieved some sample collection experiments from the outside of the
complex. Flight engineer Aleksandr Lazutkin remained inside the Mir
complex.

Recent Launches
---------------

GOES K was launched from Cape Canaveral on Apr 25. The Geostationary
Operational Environmental Satellite has been renamed GOES 10 now that it
is in orbit safely. Operated by NOAA, the US National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration, the GOES satellites provide those familiar
continent-wide views of the weather, operating in collaboration with
NOAA's low polar orbiting satellites which provide smaller-area
closeups. GOES K is the third of the 3-axis-stabilized GOES-Next series
of satellites, built by Space Systems/Loral. Earlier GOES versions were
spin-stabilized vehicles built by Hughes and by SS/Loral's precursor,
Ford Aerospace. GOES 10 will be used as an orbital spare. It was placed
in an initial 167 x 42131 km x 27.1 deg transfer orbit. By Apr 29 it had
maneuvered to a 10907 x 42227 km x 8.1 deg orbit on its way to
geosynchronous.

Launch vehicle for GOES K was the final Atlas I Centaur, serial AC-79.
The Atlas I (Roman numeral 1) Centaur per se first flew in Jul 1990, as
a renamed version of the Atlas G (letter G) Centaur to distinguish it
from the stretched Atlas II which was considered a significantly
different vehicle. The first Atlas Centaur, AC-1, an Atlas D/Centaur D
variant, was launched on a suborbital test flight in May 1962 but failed
less than a minute after launch. The second Centaur D, AC-2, reached
orbit in Nov 1963 as the first space flight of a high-energy fuel
(liquid hydrogen) rocket.

I have recently compiled a list of all Centaur launches, and all 
orbital objects associated with those launches. You can find it at:

Thanks to the Canarians who wrote to me defending the status of their
islands as part of the European cultural and political spheres.
Nevertheless, I maintain that geographically it's not part of Europe, 
just as a satellite launch from Hawaii would not be from North America.

Shuttle and Mir
---------------

The spacesuits used on the latest Mir spacewalk were, of course, the
new Orlan-M variant and not the old Orlan-DMA. I got confused about
the designations. 
 The original Orlan suit was built for the lunar program. The long
duration Orlan-D was the first to actually fly, on Salyut-6.
Salyut-7 started off with Orlan-D suits, but in 1985 new Orlan-DM suits were 
delivered. Mir started off with the DM model, and the new DMA model
arrived aboard Progress-37 or Progress-38 in 1988. Up to four suits
have been in service on the station at any one time. Orlan-DMA No. 11
was used on a total of 14 spacewalks from 1988 to 1991. The Orlan-DMA
suits are now being replaced by the Orlan-M. A first attempt at a chronology
of Orlan suit use is at

Launch of STS-84 is scheduled for May 15. Atlantis carries the
Orbiter Docking System and the Spacehab Double Module, and will
dock with the Mir complex. Mike Foale will replace Jerry Linenger
aboard the station.

Recent Launches
---------------

McDonnell Douglas launched a Delta 7920 rocket from Vandenberg on May 5,
the first Delta launch since January's failure. It carried five
satellites for Iridium LLC. The Delta successfully reached
transfer orbit, and the second stage later reignited to circularize
in a 625 x 643 km x 86.4 deg orbit from which it dispensed the five
payloads. After the depletion burn, the Delta stage was in a 595 x 949 km
x 86.7 deg orbit.

The Motorola Iridium satellites mark the first use of the Lockheed
Martin LM700 bus, and carry a communications payload built by Motorola's
Satcom division in Chandler, Arizona. They will provide global personal
telephone service. This first launch carried space vehicles 4 through 8
(presumably 1 to 3 were ground test vehicles). The satellites have a
mass of about 700 kg. The satellites carry intersatellite crosslinks at
Ka-band (23 GHz), L-band (1.6 GHz) links to and from the Iridium hand
sets, and Ka-band links to the gateway ground stations which connect to
the local public telephone networks. The master control facility  is in
the Virginia suburbs of Washington.

A Chinese DFH-3 (Zhongxing 6?) communications satellite was launched on
May 11 into a 207 x 35887 km x 28.46 deg transfer orbit by a  Chang
Zheng (Long March) 3A rocket.

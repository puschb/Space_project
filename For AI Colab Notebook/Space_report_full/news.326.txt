Shuttle and Mir
---------------

Orbiter OV-102 Columbia was launched on mission STS-94 on Jul 1 at
1802:02 UTC. The RSRM-62 solid rocket motors separated at 1804 UTC.
The ET-86 external tank separated at 1811:13 UTC leaving
Columbia in an elliptical transfer orbit which was circularized
later by the OMS engines to a 300 km orbit inclined at 28.5 deg to
the equator.

Columbia's mission is MSL-1R, the reflight of the Microgravity Science
Laboratory. The MSL-1 mission was cut short earlier this year
when a fuel cell malfunctioned. This is the first time that a Shuttle crew
has been recycled to fly a mission again.

The collision on Mir happened at around 0910 UTC Jun 25 according to
Vladimir Agapov. The cosmonauts reported it to the ground no earlier
than 0917 UTC when they got into the radio communication zone. The
Spektr module hatch was closed by 0938 UTC.

Progress M-34 was deorbited over the Pacific at 0534 UTC on Jul 2.
The replacement cargo ship, Progress M-35, was launched on Jul 5.
It will deliver repair equipment to the Mir station.

Mars Pathfinder
---------------

The Mars Pathfinder (MPF) space probe landed on Mars at 1656 UTC on Jul 4.
Mars Pathfinder is part of NASA's Discovery program.
The spacecraft consists of:
 - a cruise stage, which separates prior to entry into the Martian
     atmosphere
 - an aeroshell, which protects the lander during atmospheric entry,
 - main parachute, 12.7m diameter
 - backshell with RAD Rocket Assisted Decelerator, which brakes the craft
   just before touchdown,
 - a set of airbags which inflate prior to touchdown,
 - the MPF lander itself,
 - the MFEX (MicroRover Flight Experiment), or Sojourner, a small 10 kg
   automated vehicle.
MPF was built by the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL), which also controls
the mission. The lander has a camera and a meteorology experiment.
The rover has an X-ray spectrometer to study the composition of
rocks at the landing site.

MPF landed in the Ares Vallis region of Mars at 19 N 34 W, southeast of
the Tharsis volcanoes and of the Viking 1 landing site. The cruise stage
separated at 1622 UTC. The aeroshell entered the Martian atmosphere at
an altitude of 125 km at 1652 UTC. At 1654 UTC the parachute deployed,
and at 1655 UTC the aeroshell separated from the lander. The rockets
fired, the airbags inflated, and the MPF lander reached the surface at
about 1656 UTC, landing on its base petal. The light travel time from
Mars to Earth is 10 minutes and 40 seconds. At around 1706 UTC
transmissions from the surface were received at JPL. The airbags then
were slowly deflated, and at around 1800 UTC the side petals deployed to
orient the lander correctly. Confirmation of petal deployment was
received at 1836 UTC. The first pictures of the surface show an uneven
landscape with many rocks and large hills on the horizon. Controllers
plan to adjust the petals and airbags before deploying the rover, as the
petal on which the rover sits is tilted a little high. The rover is also
having problems communicating with the lander (and thus with Earth). 
Deployment of the Sojourner rover was planned for Jul 6 at the time of
writing.

Recent Launches
---------------

The other NASA Discovery program probe launched so far is NEAR, the Near
Earth Asteroid Rendezvous spacecraft. Built and operated by the Applied
Physics Lab of Johns Hopkins University, NEAR was launched in Feb 1996.
On Jun 27 NEAR made a 1200 km flyby of minor planet (253) Mathilde, the
first C-type minor planet to be visited by a probe. On Jul 3 NEAR made a
major orbit maneuver to target it for  a Dec 1998 rendezvous with minor
planet (433) Eros.

The Midori (ADEOS) satellite failed on Jun 30 for unknown reasons. Space
debris collision was initially suggested but that seems unlikely since
a gradual power decline was observed before the failure.

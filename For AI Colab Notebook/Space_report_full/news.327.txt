Shuttle and Mir
---------------

Columbia is on orbit for mission STS-94 (Microgravity Science Lab 1R).
Experiments continue with controlled investigations of fires
in microgravity. On Jul 13 the spacecraft was in a 296 x 301 km x 28.5 deg
orbit. Meanwhile, Discovery is scheduled to be rolled out to pad 39A
on Jul 14 in preparation for launch of STS-85.

Progress M-35 was launched on Jul 5 at 0411:54 UTC toward the Mir
station. It docked with the rear of the 37KE (Kvant) module at 0559:24
UTC on Jul 7 using the automatic Kurs system. (The Progress M-34 also
docked successfully using this system; it was only when they tried
testing the new manual system that things went wrong).

Carl Sagan Memorial Station
----------------------------

The Mars Pathfinder (MPF) space probe landed on Mars at 1656 UTC on Jul
4. It now appears that the lander made about 15 bounces before coming
to rest and rolled about 1 km.
On Jul 5, the lander was renamed the Carl Sagan Memorial Station.
Early on Jul 6, the Sagan Station deployed the rover ramps. A few hours
later the Sojourner rover rolled down the ramps and it is now on the
Martian surface.

The new estimate of the landing site coordinates is 33.55 deg West,
19.33 deg N. I haven't seen this mentioned elsewhere and had forgotten
it myself, but the Sagan Station site is actually within the ellipse of
Viking Site A-1, where Viking Lander 1 (since renamed Mutch Memorial
Station) was originally meant to land on July 4, 1976. When Viking 1
reached Mars orbit in Jun 1976 and started imaging site A-1, JPL decided
that the terrain was too rough, and delayed the landing while they
searched for a smoother site, eventually settling on the Chryse Planitia
site where Viking landed on 1976 Jul 20. Mars Pathfinder was able to
land on the rougher A-1 site because of its robust airbag landing
system, and indeed the rocky images from Sagan Memorial Station suggest
that it was a really good thing Viking didn't try landing there.

Oh, and Russell Eberst points out that I can't spell Margaritifer Sinus.
(see last week).

Recent Launches
---------------

Five more Iridium satellites were launched from Vandenberg on Jul 9. The
Delta launch vehicle placed the five Motorola-built communications
satellites in polar orbits. Their on-board propulsion systems will be
used to raise their orbits later from 640 km to 780 km. The satellites
from the previous two launches have now reached their operating orbits.
The three Iridium launches have places their satellites into orbital
planes 30 degrees apart.

  Iridium satellites in orbit:

 SV021      Jul  9     626 x 643 km x 86.4 deg 184

The FY-2 (FengYun 2) weather satellite, launched by a CZ-3 rocket from
Xichang on Jun 10, is now on station at 104.1 deg E. (Some Western
publications call this satellite FY-2 1R to denote that it is a
replacement flight article for the first FY-2 which was destroyed in a
ground test, but I haven't seen that name used by Chinese news 
releases).

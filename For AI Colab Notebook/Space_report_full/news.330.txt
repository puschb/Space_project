Shuttle and Mir
---------------

The Mir crew handover was formally completed at some point around Aug
8-11. Mike Foale transferred to become a member of the new Mir EO-24
crew with Anatoliy Solov'yov and Pavel Vinogradov. The EO-23 crew of
Vasiliy Tsibliev and Aleksandr Lazutkin handed over the station and on
Aug 14 entered their Soyuz TM-25  transport ship, closing the hatches at
0550 UTC. Soyuz TM-25 undocked from the Mir forward port on Aug 14 at
0855 UTC and at 1122 UTC fired the deorbit engine on the PAO
(priborno-agregatniy otsek, equipment-service module). The PAO and the
BO (bitovoy otsek, living module) separated from the SA (spuskaemiy
apparat, descent craft) a few minutes later. The PAO and BO burned up in
the atmosphere. The SA reentered, and landed in Kazakstan at 1217 UTC,
170 km SE of Dzezkazgan. The Soyuz landing rockets failed to fire on
touchdown, giving one of the roughest landings experienced by a
returning Mir crew.

The new EO-24 crew of Solov'yov, Vinogradov and Foale undocked from the
Kvant module in Soyuz TM-26 on Aug 15 at 1329 UTC, and redocked
with the forward Mir port at 1413 UTC.  The Progress M-35 cargo ship
remains in orbit and is expected to redock with the Mir station soon at
the Kvant port. A docking attempt was called off on Aug 17 because the
wrong instructions were sent to the Progress. Meanwhile, the crew
have repaired the Elektron oxygen generator. (Thanks to Chris van den
Berg, Igor Lissov and Vladimir Agapov for some of these details).

The CRISTA-SPAS satellite was recaptured by Discovery's RMS arm
at 1514 UTC on Aug 16. Landing is due for Aug 18.

Errata on Shuttle crewing: Wendy Lawrence is still on the STS-86 crew,
but has been pulled off the Mir EO-24 long-stay crew. She will fly on 
the Shuttle to Mir, but will come down again on the same mission. David
Wolf is an addition to the STS-86 crew and will replace Foale on the
EO-24 crew. Also, Tryggvason has the rank of Payload Specialist on
STS-85, not Mission Specialist as I suggested.

Recent Launches
---------------

A Proton-K launch vehicle took off from Baykonur on Aug 14 and entered a
164 x 190 km x 53.2 deg parking orbit. The Blok DM-2 upper stage then
fired to place the Kosmos-2345 payload in a 232 x 35292 km x 50.0 deg
transfer orbit. It is expected that the DM-2 will reignite to lower
inclination and enter a near-geosynchronous orbit. This launch profile
is unusual; a 51.6 degree parking orbit has been used for other Proton
geostationary launches, with a 47 degree transfer orbit. Igor Lissov
reports a rumour that the Proton was incorrectly targeted and would have
gone to the regular 51.6 degree orbit but for an error by the launch
crew. The payload is probably either an early warning satellite or a
military communications satellite.

Orbimage's OrbView-2 satellite began to raise its orbit on Aug 12.
The initial orbit was only 300 km in altitude, and a hydrazine
propulsion system raises it in stages to 700 km.

Shuttle and Mir
---------------

Progress M-35 successfully redocked with Mir at 1253 UTC on Aug 18.
The Mir computer crashed just before the docking, and the station
drifted out of attitude, causing the Progress automatic docking
system to shut down; however, commander Solov'yov completed the
docking by manual remote control. The computer was repaired by Aug 19,
and the internal spacewalk was delayed only two days.

Solov'yov and Vinogradov began their internal spacewalk on Aug 22.
Vinogradov worked inside the Spektr module while Solov'yov helped
him from the transfer compartment (perekhodniy ostek), the central
node where all the big modules and the Soyuz transport craft are docked.
Foale spent the spacewalk in the descent craft of the Soyuz, with
the two hatches of the Soyuz habitation module between him and the
depressurized transfer node. 

Depressurization of the transfer node was begun at 0959 UTC, but when a
leak in Vinogradov's glove was found a repressurization was ordered, at
about 1030 UTC. He swapped the glove for a spare, and depressurization
began again at around 1045 UTC.  The hatch to Spektr was opened at 1114
UTC and Vinogradov entered the module at about 1138 UTC. By 1300 UTC the
cables had been connected to the hatch and Vinogradov began
unsuccessfully searching for the hull puncture. By 1400 UTC he was out
of the module and work to seal the hatch was underway. The hatch was
sealed at 1430 UTC and  repressurization of the transfer compartment
began; repressurization was well underway at the 1447 UTC communications
pass and was completed at 1503 UTC. Estimated times for the first
depressurization about 0h30min, and for the second about 3h 50min.
The formal time of the spacewalk according to NASA was 5h 04min 
(suits on battery power to completion of repress), although usually
NASA only counts to the beginning of repress which would make the time
about 4h 31m. 

Discovery completed mission STS-85, landing on RW33 at Kennedy Space
Center at 1108 UTC on Aug 19. Atlantis/STS-86 was rolled out to the
launch pad on Aug 18; it will go to Mir and trade Dave Wolf for Mike
Foale.


Recent Launches
---------------

China's Chang Zheng 3B launch vehicle made its first successful launch
on Aug 19 from Xichang. The previous attempt failed shortly after
takeoff causing numerous casualties. The CZ-3B ("Long March 3B") is
built by the China Academy of Launch Vehicle Technology (CALT) near
Beijing, with the first two stages made by the Shanghai Bureau of
Astronautics. The powerful liquid-hydrogen third stage  made its fourth
successful flight (it is also used on the CZ-3A).

The CZ-2, CZ-3 and CZ-4 rockets all use a common two-stage core. There's
an older version of these core stages, built by CALT, and an upgraded
version, which is built by Shanghai for at least some of the variants.
The various Long March rockets are:

Variant  Prime         Configuration
         Contractor
 CZ-2C:  CALT          Old core
 CZ-2D:  Shanghai      New core
 CZ-2E:  CALT          New core with stretched stage 2, plus 4 liquid boosters
 CZ-3:   CALT          Old core with small LOX/LH2 stage
 CZ-3A:  CALT          New core with large LOX/LH2 stage
 CZ-3B:  CALT          New core with large LOX/LH2 stage and 4 liquid boosters
 CZ-4:   Shanghai      New core with conventional third stage

CALT's old original CZ-2 (1974), Shanghai's FB-1 (1973-1981), and CALT's
DF-5 ballistic missile are believed to have been similar to the CZ-2C.
The DF-31 ballistic missile may be similar to the CZ-2D. CALT's CZ-1
used to launch the first two Chinese satellites in 1970-71 was a smaller
rocket of a different design.

The CZ-3B placed in geostationary transfer orbit a Space Systems/Loral
FS-1300 communications satellite, Agila 2. Agila 2, also known as
Mabuhay, is owned by Mabuhay Phillipine Satellite Corp.

The fourth Iridium launch, on Aug 21, placed five more Motorola/Lockheed
cellphone satellites in orbit using a Boeing Delta 7920 launch vehicle
from Vandenberg AFB in California. This is the first Delta launch since
McDonnell Douglas merged with Boeing. 

Lockheed Martin Astronautics (Denver) successfully launched the second
LMLV-1 Lockheed Martin Launch Vehicle from Vandenberg's Space Launch
Complex 6 on Aug 23. (The first vehicle, built by Lockheed/Sunnyvale
prior to the Martin Marietta merger and at that time called LLV-1, was
destroyed in an Aug 1995 launch attempt). The LMLV is launched from the
pedestal originally build for one of the Shuttle's solid rocket
boosters. The LMLV carried NASA's Lewis remote sensing satellite which
features an imaging spectrometer (so-called `hyperspectral imager').
Lewis is built and operated by TRW under NASA HQ's Small Spacecraft
Technology Initiative (a companion satellite, Clark, is being built by
the bit of Orbital Sciences Corp. that used to be CTA). Unlike most NASA
satellites, there is no NASA center managing the program, although
Stennis Space Center is involved in the data distribution. The Lewis
satellite also carries an ultraviolet background astronomy experiment
from Berkeley. Initial orbit of Lewis is 289 x 306 km  x 97.6 deg. The
LMLV-1 uses a Thiokol/Utah Castor 120 first stage (a variant of the
Peacekeeper ICBM's TU-120 motor), an Orbus 21D second stage from UTC/San
Jose, and an Orbit Adjust Module with Olin/RRC thrusters. A hydrazine
propellant system will raise Lewis' orbit to its operational altitude.
Congratulations to the folks at LMA/Denver on getting the LMLV to orbit.

Kosmos-2345 is now in near-geostationary orbit. It is reported to
be heading for 24W and is therefore probably a Prognoz-class
early warning satellite built by the Lavochkin association.

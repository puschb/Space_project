Shuttle and Mir
---------------

Titov and Parazynski entered the Shuttle payload bay on Oct 1 while
Atlantis was docked to Mir. The airlock was depressurized at around 1725
UTC and the astronauts emerged from the hatch on the tunnel adapter at
around 1735 UTC. They retrieved the four MEEP exposure packages from
Mir's SO module and installed the Spektr solar array cap there. The
airlock was repressurized at 2231 UTC.

Atlantis undocked from Mir at 1728 UTC on Oct 3, leaving Dave Wolf
aboard the station and bringing Mike Foale home. The crew fired the
engines to deorbit at 2047 UTC on Oct 6 and landed at Kennedy Space
Center at 2155. 

The Progress 7K-TGM No. 237 cargo ship was launched from 5 GIK
(Baykonur) on Oct 5 and named Progress M-36. An attempt to undock
Progress M-35 from the Kvant module failed when some latches did not
open. (This is the first ever undocking failure that I am aware of; any
counterexamples, anyone? I guess the failure to jettison the KRT-10
radio antenna in 1979 may count, although that was more a separation
failure than an undocking... of course cataloging events that
failed to occur is always philosophically a little tricky!) Once
M-35 has been undocked, M-36 will link up at that port.

Recent Launches
---------------

Echostar 3 was launched by Lockheed Martin Astronautics Atlas 2AS on Oct
5. AC-135 was launched from Cape Canaveral's Launch Complex 36. The
payload is a Lockheed Martin Telecommunications A2100 satellite, and was
the first to be built in LMT's new Sunnyvale, California factory instead
of the old RCA location at East Windsor, New Jersey. It will be used
by Echostar Communications Corp. This is the 4th A2100 series satellite,
following GE 1 to GE 3 for GE Americom.

News reports confirm that the Indian PSLV rocket entered the wrong
orbit. Apparently the liquid-propellant fourth stage, PS-4, may have had
a fuel leak causing a premature shutdown. The IRS-1D satellite does have
a small amount of fuel for precise orbit control which will be used to
raise the perigee, but this will shorten its operational life
considerably. Meanwhile, India's Insat 2D geostationary comsat has
failed on orbit after only a few months of life.

NASA's Lewis satellite reentered on Sep 28. Controllers were unable
to rescue the mission after it lost attitude a few days after launch.

Observers from the Kettering Group report speculation that Kosmos-2346,
which I had identified as a Parus military navigation satellite, may in fact
be a test flight of the Tsikada-M-UTTH nav/comms payload first
described by the Russians in 1994. I'm inclined to keep listing it
as a Parus until we get more definitive info.

The Mars Global Surveyor continues aerobraking. As of Oct 3 it
was in a 110 x 48770 km x 93.3 deg orbit around Mars.

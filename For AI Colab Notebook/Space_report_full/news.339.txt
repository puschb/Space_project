Editorial
---------

Apologies for the gap in service; I've been travelling.  Of course, I
leave the office for two weeks and more stuff goes on than usually
happens in two months - so this issue is a big one. Note: I've recently
updated some of the info on my space home page
http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~jcm/space/space.html including the
geostationary satellite log.

Shuttle and Mir
---------------

Columbia is now on pad 39B ready for launch on mission STS-87,
scheduled for Nov 19.

Mir crew Solov'yov and Vinogradov carried out a 6h38min internal
spacewalk on Oct 20, during which they worked inside the depressurized
Mir base block transfer compartment and the damaged Spektr module to
connect new cables to the Spektr module, restoring the capability
to point the Spektr solar arrays. NASA astronaut David Wolf remained
inside the station.

During an EVA on Nov 3 the Mir crew removed an old solar panel from
Kvant. The solar panel was retracted on command, removed from the
Kvant module, and stowed on the exterior of the core module.
It will be replaced by a US/Russian cooperative solar array
currently stored folded up on the Docking Module.
The outer Kvant-2 hatch did not seal correctly after the EVA, but
the inner hatch is well sealed.

The Sputnik-40 1/3-scale model of PS-1 ("Sputnik" ) was also
hand-launched during the EVA into a 383 x 391 km x 51.6 deg orbit. The
model is also referred to as PS-2, but this is a bad idea since PS-2 was
the correct name of the second Soviet satellite, which carried the dog
Laika. Sputnik-40  (the French spelling Spoutnik-40 may also be
considered correct) was cataloged by US Space Command as object 24958,
previously reserved for the Intelsat 803 Ariane rocket which has
apparently still not been tracked. The model was built by high school
students in the republic of Kabardin-Balakarsk in the Russian
Federation, in the Caucasus near Chechnya.  The radio transmitter
payload was built by students on Reunion, a French territory in the
Mascarene Islands in the Indian Ocean east of Madagascar. If anyone
knows the exact time the Sputnik model was released, please let me know.

Recent Launches
---------------

The NASA/ESA Cassini/Huygens Saturn probe was launched on Oct 15. Launch
vehicle was Titan 4B Centaur, serial B-33. The Titan took off at 0843
UTC, and separated from the Centaur at 0852 UTC. The first Centaur burn
placed the Centaur/Cassini combination in a 168 x 446 km x 28.7 deg
parking orbit at 0854 UTC. Centaur restarted at about 0913 UTC and shut
down again at 0919 UTC, now on an escape trajectory from the Earth. It
separated from Cassini at 0926 UTC and vented its remaining propellants
to move its path away from the space probe. I don't have any solar
orbital elements for Cassini yet. Cassini was built by JPL, with a
Propulsion Module System built by Lockheed Martin/Denver. The
ESA Huygens probe, which will land on Titan, was built by Aerospatiale
and CASA.

Mars Global Surveyor has raised its perigee to 170 km while controllers
study unexpected movements in its loose solar panel.
Meanwhile, JPL announced the end of the Mars Pathfinder mission;
last signal detected from the Sagan Memorial Station was on Oct 6.

Apstar 2R was launched on Oct 16. It is an SS/Loral FS-1300 comsat
for Asia Pacific Telecom and will provide telecom services for China.
Launch vehicle was a Chinese Chang Zheng (Long March) 3B, the third
to be launched. Apstar 2R is now on station at 76 deg E.

The third NRO Lacrosse radar imaging satellite was launched on Oct 24
into a 425 x 672 km x 57.0 deg orbit; the on board engine will
circularize the orbit later. It replaces the first Lacrosse in a 57
degree orbit. Launch vehicle was a Titan 4A, serial A-18 (formerly
K-18). The payload is publicly identified as USA 133; it reportedly
carries a large radar to  carry out reconnaissance missions even in the
presence of cloud cover. The satellite is probably built by Lockheed
Martin Astronautics/Denver.

DSCS III B-13 is an X-band (8/7 GHz) comsat for the US Department of
Defense, built by Lockheed Martin/Valley Forge (formerly GE Space; this
satellite, however, was the first DSCS to complete its testing at
Lockheed Martin/Sunnyvale). Lockheed Martin/Denver's Atlas Centaur
AC-131 placed the satellite in transfer orbit, and the IABS-6 upper
stage (using twin Marquardt R-4D liquid apogee engines) circularized it
at geostationary altitude. Launch of AC-131 was on Oct 25. The AC-131
Centaur stage has an attached secondary payload, the USAF Academy's
Falcon Gold experiment to test out the usability of GPS navigation at
geostationary altitude.

The STEP M4 satellite, built by TRW/Chantilly and launched for the US
Air Force Space Test Program as flight P95-1, failed to communicate with
the ground after launch on Oct 22 and a spacecraft emergency was
declared. So far controllers have not been able to contact the
satellite. It appears that the solar panels failed to deploy. The launch
itself was another success for Orbital's Pegasus XL.  The 400 kg
research satellite carries the Orbiting Ozone and Aerosol Measurement
experiment, the Electromagnetic Propagation Experiment, and the Digital
Ion Drift Meter. The STEP program record has been rather mixed, with the last
three missions failing (and STEP M2 operating from a lower than planned orbit):
P90-5  STEP M0   1994 Mar 13      Taurus       539 x 559 km x 105.0 deg
P91-2  STEP M2   1994 May 19      Pegasus/HAPS 603 x 821 km x 82.0 deg
P90-1  STEP M1   1994 Jun 27      Pegasus XL   Failed to orbit
P92-2  STEP M3   1995 Jun 22      Pegasus XL   Failed to orbit
P95-1  STEP M4   1997 Oct 22      Pegasus XL   433 x 501 km x 45.0 deg

The MIRACL laser was used on Oct 17 to illuminate the MSTI-3 satellite
in an antisatellite experiment. The experiment was not intended to
damage the satellite, just to measure the illumination level; however, a
telemetry problem prevented MSTI-3's data from being returned. MSTI-3 is
a USAF (originally SDIO) satellite carrying experimental infrared
sensors.

The European Space Agency launched the Ariane 502 vehicle on Oct 30.
This was a crucial launch for the future of ESA and Arianespace,
following the failure of Ariane 501. The vehicle placed its payloads in
orbit, but  the EPC core stage shut down early and had a roll control
problem, making the orbit significantly lower than planned, at 534 x
26631 km x 7.8 deg. The EAP solid boosters and the EPS final stage
appear to have operated correctly. The main payload was MAQSAT-H, built
by Kayser-Threde of Munich as a dummy comsat with accelerometers to
measure the launch environment. The TEAMSAT experiment package, attached
to MAQSAT-H, was developed by ESTEC and carries several technology
experiments. TEAMSAT has ejected a subsatellite, the YES (Young
Engineers Satellite) which is a small satellites with several
experiments, (but a 20 km tether experiment will not be carried out due
to space debris concerns). MAQSAT-B, also built by Kayser-Threde, is a
smaller dummy satellite stored below the SPELTRA dual launch adapter and
which remains attached to the EPS stage. A dummy ballast mass replaced
the AMSAT amateur radio satellite which was pulled off the mission
because of a predicted rougher ride than originally specified; this
ballast probably is also attached to MAQSAT-B.

Brazil's first satellite launch attempt failed on Nov 2. The VLS rocket
was destroyed 65 seconds after launch.  VLS (Veiculo Laucadror de
Satelites) has an S43TM core stage with four similar S43 strapons; an
S40TM second stage; and an S44 third stage. The S43 stage which appears
to have failed was previously flown on the Sonda 4 sounding rocket and
the VLS-R1 test vehicle.

This was the first orbital launch attempt from the Centro Tecnico
Aeroespacial at Alcantara, Maranhao state, Brasil (02 deg 17' S, 44 deg 23' W), carried
out under the auspices of the Brazilian space agency INPE (Instituto
Nacional de Pesquisas Espacias). The payload was SCD-2A, Satelite de
Coleta de Dados (Data Collection Satellite), a 150 kg satellite which
was a refurbished prototype for SCD-1, launched by Pegasus in 1993. The
SCD satellites relay environmental data from remote stations in the
Amazon basin   to a ground station at Cuiaba. The satellite is an
octagonal cylinder, 1.0 m in diameter and 0.72 m high.

The Foton No. 11 microgravity spacecraft carried the first Kayser-Threde
Mirka reentry vehicle. It contains experiments to study reentry
technology and heat shield materials.  Both the Foton descent module and
Mirka were successfully recovered in Kazakstan on Oct 23.

Launch of the GPS SVN38 navigation satellite is scheduled for Nov 6.

Vacation Report
----------------

The Centre Spatial de Toulouse (CST) of CNES (Centre National d'Etudes
Spatiales) has been France's main space development and satellite
control center since the mid 1970s. Very roughly, CNES/Evry maps to
NASA-Marshall, CNES/Kourou to NASA-KSC, CNES/Paris to NASA HQ, and
CNES/Toulouse to NASA-Goddard (and to a lesser extent JSC, with some hopes
to be JPL as well). The operations control center at CST takes care of
the Telecom and TDF comsats and the Spot remote sensing satellites, and
also provides its services to commercial comsat clients for early
orbit operations and checkout, with multiple independent control rooms
available for dual-satellite launches. There's also a separate control center
for the COSPAS/SARSAT search and rescue system, which relays emergency
messages to the relevant rescue agencies. The digital SAR package on
NOAA's weather satellites is made by the folks at Toulouse. CST is
currently developing the Proteus minisatellite, which will be first used
for the international Jason altimetry project. Other divisions
at CST are responsible for Spot and Helios, for microgravity missions
and piloted flights, microsatellites and balloons. Thanks to my friends at
CNES for their remarkable hospitality.

Cite de l'Espace

I also visited the Cite de L'Espace, Toulouse's space tourist
attraction. It's sort of accessible by public transport, but for some
incomprehensible reason the bus line stops one km short of it. The main
attraction is a lifesize Ariane 5; you can walk underneath the main
engine and there is a small exhibition on Ariane propulsion systems
inside the dummy launch tower. An Ariane 1 in pieces illustrates the
different tanks and interstages making up a rocket. On display are full
size models of Sputnik, ERS 2, Soyuz, Starlette, Mage 2, Telecom 1,
Meteosat and Soho.  There's a nice display on COSPAS/SARSAT and a model
of the Columbus lab that you can walk in, and some fairly good  displays
on satellite components, plus some nice meteorites. A lot of the
material on display is from products of Matra Marconi Space/Toulouse,
which is not too surprising.

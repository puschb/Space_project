Jonathan's Space Report

Fingers tightly crossed.....
----------------------------------------------------

The launch of orbiter Discovery and the Hubble Space Telescope
was scrubbed at T-4min on Apr 10 due to a problem with APU 1.
The APU (Auxiliary Power Unit) exhibited erratic behaviour during
startup. The launch may be attempted again on Apr 11.

Anatoli Solov'yov (Komandir) and Aleksandr Balandin (Bortinzhener)
continue in orbit aboard the Mir complex. The Soyuz TM-9 transport
and the Progress M-3 freighter are currently at the station. 
Solov'yov and Balandin have been in space for 58 days.

The Pegasus winged rocket made its first flight on Apr 5, launched by
the NASA NB-52 over the Pacific Ocean.  NASA's Pegsat satellite was
successfully placed in orbit, together with the second DARPA Global Low
Orbiting Message Relay satellite. 

Remember Westar VI? Challenger deployed it in Feb 1984, the Pam-D upper
stage failed and left it in low orbit.  Discovery retrieved it in Nov
84, and the insurance company sold it.  The satellite eventually ended
up as Asiasat 1, property of Asia Satellite Communications Co of Hong
Kong.  Asiasat 1 returned to orbit on Apr 7 aboard a Chinese Chang Zheng
3 launch vehicle.  This was the first Chinese launch of a non-Chinese
satellite, from Xichang Space Center. 

Kosmos-2063, an early warning satellite, was launched on Mar 27.

Apr 12 will mark the 29th anniversary of the first human flight in 
space by Yuriy Alekseevich Gagarin aboard the spaceship 'Vostok'.

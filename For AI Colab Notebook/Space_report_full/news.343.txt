Errata
------

Several recent mistakes have been pointed out to me: the first STS-87
EVA ended 0745 UTC not 0945! Sorry about that. The GPS launch last month
was Nov 6 at 0030 UTC, not Nov 5. In JSR 334, I reported the Mars Global
Surveyor insertion burn time as 0015 UTC, should have been 0117 UTC. As
always, I will try and correct mistakes when folks bring them to my
attention.

Shuttle and Mir
---------------

STS-87/Columbia continues its flight with microgravity science research
on the USMP-4 payload. NASA has decided not to redeploy Spartan on this
mission. On Dec 2, Spartan was unberthed with the RMS arm and used while
attached to the arm for tests of an instrument called the Video Guidance
Sensor which will be used during space station dockings. During an EVA
on Dec 3, Doi and Scott carried out more tests of the Space Station
crane. They also deployed the AERCam/Sprint 'football' remote-controlled
camera for a free flight in the payload bay. The astronauts went to
battery power at 0909 UTC Dec 3, by which time the airlock was already
depressurized. Scott deployed the camera at 1215 UTC and recovered it at
1327 UTC. Airlock was repressurized at 1409 UTC. Landing is expected Dec
5.

Meanwhile, Endeavour is being prepared for a January launch
and will soon be connected to the external tank; and stacking
of solid boosters for Columbia's next flight has already begun.

Recent Launches
---------------

NASDA, Japan's applications space agency, launched an H-2 rocket from
Tanegashima Space Center on Nov 27 carrying TRMM and ETS-7. ETS-7
(Engineering Test Satellite 7) is also called Hikoboshi; a small target
satellite, Orihime, will separate and Hikoboshi will carry out
rendezvous and docking experiments with it. ETS-7 is built by Toshiba,
with the docking system developed by Mitsubishi. ETS-7 is having some
problems with its solar array drive, and orbit raising burns have been
delayed. Although Space Command is tracking an object 1997-74C in a
similar orbit which Goddard has identified as the ETS-7 target
satellite, it seems unlikely that the latter has actually separated from
ETS-7 at this point. Does anyone have definite info on the
identification of objects 1997-74C and 74D? I suspect it is more likely
that they are adapters connecting ETS-7 to the launch vehicle, or TRMM
sensor covers. TRMM (Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission) is a joint
NASDA/NASA project. Built by NASA-Goddard and part of NASA's Earth Probe
series, it will improve climate models and study El Nino. 

JCSAT-5 is a comsat for Japan Satellite Systems (JSAT) built by
Hughes/El Segundo using the HS-601 bus. It was launched on an
Arianespace Ariane 44P rocket on Dec 2 into geostationary transfer
orbit of 214 x 35758 km x 4.0 deg.

Usually dual payload launches on Ariane involve an adapter called
SPELDA which covers the lower satellite; on this mission a simpler
and smaller cylinder called Cyclade covered the lower payload,
a small space science satellite, Equator-S. (Cyclade was used once
before, on the May 1993 launch of the Arsene satellite).

Equator-S was built by Germany's MPE (Max-Planck-Institut fur
Extraterrestrische Physik) and is part of the International
Solar-Terrestrial physics Program. It will study particles and fields in
the equatorial magnetosphere. A Thiokol Star 13A solid motor will fire
to place Equator-S in an orbit with a 65000 km apogee.

Astra 1G, launched on Dec 2, is an HS-601HP comsat from Hughes for the
SES (Societe Europeene des Satellites, based in Luxembourg), which provides
television broadcasting in Europe.

Astra 1G was launched by International Launch Services on a Krunichev
Proton-K rocket with an RKK Energiya upper stage, Blok DM3 No. 2L After
six hours the second burn of the Blok DM3 placed Astra 1G in a 10211 x
35989 km x 12.3 deg transfer orbit.

Shuttle and Mir
---------------

Solov'yov and Vinogradov made a 3h 6min spacewalk on Jan 9 to
recover some equipment and begin repairs to the leaking Kvant-2 airlock
hatch; they found a bolt on the hatch was not tight, causing a 10-mm
gap.

Launch of STS-89 to Mir is scheduled for Jan 22. Crew is Terrence
Wilcutt, Joe Edwards, James Reilly, Michael Anderson, Andy Thomas and
Bonnie Dunbar (all of NASA) and Salizhan Sharipov (Russian Air Force).
Thomas will replace David Wolf aboard Mir.


Recent Launches
---------------

Lunar Prospector was launched on Jan 7. The first Athena-2 launch
vehicle took off from LC46 at Spaceport Florida, the commercial
spaceport at the Cape Canaveral site. Lunar Prospector carries a gamma
ray spectrometer and other instruments (alpha particle spectrometer,
magnetometer, electron reflectometer, neutron spectrometer) to study the
composition of the lunar surface. It also carries a Celestis capsule
with some of the ashes  of lunar scientist Gene Shoemaker. LP is
a Lockheed Martin LM100 class satellite. The LM100 is a small
spin stablized bus; in its LP configuration it has a triangular structure 
(half an Iridium bus) surrounded by a cylindrical solar panel shell.

The first stage of Athena-2 is a Thiokol Castor 120 solid motor, derived
from the Peacekeeper ICBM first stage. The second stage is another
Castor 120, and the third stage is a UTC Orbus 21D solid motor. A fourth
stage, although not formally counted as such, is the lower-thrust Primex
OAM (Orbit Adjust Module) which performs final orbit insertion and trim
burns. The OAM entered orbit with the payload which then separated. The
payload consisted of the LP probe and its TLI stage, which fired its
Star 37  solid motor on the first orbit to place LP on a translunar
trajectory. LP fired its own hydrazine propulsion system and entered
a 71 x 8500 km x 89.7 deg lunar orbit on Jan 11.

A Boeing Delta 7925 launched the Skynet 4D communications satellite for the UK
Ministry of Defense on Jan 10. Skynet 4D is built by Matra Marconi
Space/Stevenage using the old ECS bus.

The 8 Orbcomm satellites launched in December, A1 to A8, were flight
models FM-5 to FM-12 respectively.

EarthWatch lost contact with the EarlyBird satellite on Dec 28.

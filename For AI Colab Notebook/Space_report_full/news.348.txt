Shuttle and Mir
---------------

The Kvant-2 airlock hatch, partially repaired in a spacewalk on Jan 9,
is still leaking slightly. Solov'yov and Wolf made a 3-hour EVA on Jan
14 to inspect the station exterior.

Space Shuttle Endeavour took off on Jan 22 on mission STS-89.  Launch
was at 0248 UTC; Endeavour flew up the eastern seabord of the US into a
51 degree orbit, and I was easily able to see it, in the seconds prior
to main engine cutoff, from the street in downtown Cambridge. Crew is
Terrence Wilcutt, Joe Edwards, James Reilly, Michael Anderson, Andy
Thomas and Bonnie Dunbar (all of NASA) and Salizhan Sharipov (Russian
Air Force). Thomas will replace David Wolf aboard Mir, and will be the
final NASA long-stay visitor to Mir. Endeavour docked with the SO module
on Mir at 2014 UTC on Jan 24.

Endeavour's cargo bay contains:
 Bay 1    Tunnel Adapter
 Bay 3    Orbiter Docking System/External Airlock
 Bay 4-7  Transfer Tunnel
 Bay 8-12 Spacehab Double Module
 Bay 13P  GABA carrier with G-141, G-145
 Bay 13S  GABA carrier with G-093, G-432

The four Getaway Special cans are G-141 and G-145, a pair of German 
materials processing experiments, G-093, a University of Michigan fluid
dynamics experiment, and G-432, a Chinese materials processing payload.
The orbiter middeck carries CEBAS, a German/US biological module for
aquatic organisms including fish and snails, and a locker containing a
dinosaur skull carried as part of a museum educational program. (As far
as I know, this is not the start of a regular `dinosaurs in space'
project, and so is unrelated to the forthcoming flights of Glenn and
Ryumin). The Spacehab carries supplies for Mir, and a test of an X-ray
crystallography detector for the Space Station.

Recent Launches
---------------

Israel launched a three-stage Shaviyt vehicle from Palamchim Air Force
Base on Jan 22, attempting to place the 'Ofeq-4 imaging satellite into
orbit. The failure seems to have occurred during second stage burn. The
Shaviyt vehicle launches west from Israel over the Mediterranean.

The NEAR asteroid rendezvous spacecraft flew past Earth on Jan 23
at 0723 UTC on Jan 23, 530 km above Iran. Sun glint from the
solar panels briefly made NEAR a naked eye object from the Western
hemisphere.

Lunar Prospector has now reached its final mapping orbit. After trim
burns it was in a 99 x 100 km circular orbit, but the uneven lunar
gravity field soon perturbed this to 80 x 120 km.

Errata
------

Maxim Tarasenko spotted two goofs in JSR347 - first, the launch on Dec
20 was Progress M-37 not Progress M-36; secondly, the Parus-class
satellite Kosmos-2346 (1997-52A) was made by AO Polyot, not NPO PM.

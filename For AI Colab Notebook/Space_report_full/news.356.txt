Shuttle and Mir
---------------

The current commander of Mir is of course Talgat Musabaev,
and not Anatoliy Solov'yov as I foolishly stated last week.
Musabaev and Budarin carried out another 6 hour spacewalk on Apr 17,
preparing for installation of the new VDU engine. Hatch open was
0740 UTC and hatch closed at 1412 UTC. Two truss structures
on the Kvant module were retracted and stored on the module
exterior; the new VDU was unlatched from its carrier in the
Progress cargo ship. It will be installed on the next EVA.

Space Shuttle OV-102 Columbia was launched into orbit on Apr 17
on an extended duration Spacelab long module mission using
Long Module Unit 2.
The STS-90 cargo bay sidewall canisters are:
 Bay 4P forward: G-744 Sierra College, ozone measurements
        aft:     G-772 Colorado, COLLIDE dust collision experiment
 Bay 4S forward: SVF   JPL Shuttle Vibration Forces experiment
        aft:     G-197 Lockheed Martin, Pulse Tube Refrigerator cryocooler
In addition, the OARE acceleration experiment is mounted on the
payload bay floor in bay 11.

STS-90/Neurolab experiments include tests on the astronauts' adaptation
to free fall, and studies on rat development and neurobiology. The life
sciences payload includes 132 rats (Rattus norvegii), four oyster
toadfish (Opsanus tau), freshwater snails (Biomphlaria glabrata),
swordtail fish (Xiphophorus helleri), and crickets (Acheta domesticus).
The Spacelab module includes the Vestibular Function Experiment Unit,
the BOTEX botany experiment incubator (used for the crickets), the CEBAS
aquatic enclosure, and various rat animal enclosures. It also includes
the VVIS centrifuge, the VCF visuo-motor coordination facility, and the
VEG virtual reality headset, all of which are used on the human
subjects. A special suit and cap to monitor astronauts while asleep is
also carried. Unfortunately, in contrast to earlier Spacelab flight
press kits, this mission's public release doesn't give details of the
layout of the Spacelab module racks.

Columbia was launched at 1819 UTC on Apr 17. The solid rocket boosters
(RSRM-65)  separated at 1821 UTC, and a few seconds later the OMS
engines ignited for a 1min 43s burn, the first OMS assist maneuver. This
adds extra thrust to that provided by the SSME main engines, and will be
needed for Space Station launches. The maneuver appears to have gone
fine. Transfer orbit insertion at main engine cutoff, 1827 UTC, was
followed by separation of external tank ET-91 and a second OMS burn at
1902 UTC to circularize the orbit at 257 x 286 km x 39.0 deg.

Meanwhile, the Shuttle launch schedule for the next year is
completely up in the air pending decisions on Space Station delays.

STS-93/AXAF
-----------

 NASA and the AXAF Science Center are sponsoring a contest to name the
Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility (AXAF), a 4-tonne X-ray telescope
to be launched on Space Shuttle Columbia in December 1998. The winner
will get a free trip to see the launch, and everyone who enters will get
a free AXAF poster. The winning entry can be the name of a place or a
thing symbolizing exploration of the universe, or a mythological or
fictional character, or a historical person (but not someone alive
today). Previous X-ray satellites have been named after physicists
Albert Einstein, Wilhelm Rontgen, and Bruno Rossi; the first X-ray
satellite, launched from Kenya, was named Uhuru after the Swahili word
for freedom. You can get details of the contest at

            http://asc.harvard.edu/contest.html

Entries are due by June 30 and the winner will be announced later
in the year.

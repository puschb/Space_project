Shuttle and Mir
---------------

The STS-90/Neurolab life sciences research mission continued after
repair of the CO2 scrubber problem reported last week. The research
mission was mostly carried out as planned, but an unexpectedly large
number of the baby rats died. Columbia landed at 1609 UTC on May 3, at
Kennedy Space Center's Runway 33. Mission duration was 15 days 21 h
49min 59 sec.

The human crew of STS-90 was Richard Searfoss (Commander), Scott Altman
(Pilot), Richard Linnehan (Payload Commander),  Kay Hire (Mission
Specialist 2), all of NASA; Dafydd Rhys Williams (Mission Specialist 3,
Canadian Space Agency); Jay Clark Buckey, Payload Specialist 1, from
Dartmouth Medical School, and James Pawelczyk, Payload Specialist 2,
from Penn State University.

Neurolab mission scientists are now studying the readaptation of 
both the rats and humans to gravity. The remaining rats will be
dissected soon after landing to study these changes; the human
crewmembers, in contrast, are being saved for a possible reflight
of the mission as early as August. 

Recent Launches
---------------

The former Asiasat 3 satellite, placed in  incorrect orbit last
December, is undergoing an unprecedented manuever. The Blok-DM3 upper
stage placed Asiasat 3 in a geostationary transfer orbit of  365 x 35989
km x 51.6 deg instead of a geostationary circular orbit at 35780 x 35800
km x 0 deg. The satellite has now become the property of Hughes Global
Services, and has been informally renamed HGS-1. The Hughes HS-601 class
satellite is now using its Marquardt R-4D-11-300  liquid propulsion
system  at perigee to raise its apogee to lunar distance, and use lunar
gravity to maneuver it toward a final orbit. Apogee was raised to 88000
km on Apr 16, 108000 km on Apr 18,  148000 km on Apr 23, 207000 km on
Apr 26, and 319785 km on Apr 30, according to Space Command tracking
data. Final translunar injection on May 7 will lead to HGS-1 making a
circumlunar pass on May 13 followed by a return to  geosynchronous
altitudes. The lunar flyby will be made with the satellite in
spin-stabilized mode, with the two main antennas deployed to give it
extra stability.

The Cassini probe made a flyby of Venus on Apr 26. This gravity assist
maneuver is the first in a series Cassini will make in the inner solar
system before heading out to Saturn. Cassini came to 284 km above the
surface of Venus at about 1345:41 UTC. 

Egypt's first satellite, Nilesat 101, was launched on Apr 28. An Ariane
44P launch vehicle placed it and Japan's BSAT 1b into geostationary
transfer orbit. Nilesat 101 is a Matra Marconi Space Eurostar 2000
communications satellite with 12 Ku-band transponders. BSAT 1b is a
Hughes HS-376 spin-stabilized satellite.

A Russian military satellite was launched into geostationary orbit on
Apr 29 using a Krunichev Proton-K rocket with an Energiya upper stage,
probably the Blok DM-2. The payload, Kosmos-2350, is either a Geizer
communications satellite built by NPO PM or an early warning satellite
built by  Lavochkin.

A Chinese CZ-2C with a Smart Dispenser upper stage placed two more
Motorola Iridium satellites in orbit on May 2. This was the fourth
launch of the CZ-2C from the new Taiyuan space center. The SD stage
placed the satellites in a 625 x 640 km orbit and then lowered itself to
a 200 km perigee orbit to ensure its rapid decay.

Shuttle and Mir
---------------

The next Shuttle mission is STS-95, in October; best wishes to
all of the folks down at KSC, hoping their homes have escaped
the depredations of the Florida wildfires.

Talgat Musabaev and Nikolai Budarin are continuing work aboard the Mir
complex. Launch of the replacement crew of Padalka and Avdeev has
slipped a couple of weeks to mid-August. On Jun 30 Mir was in a 367 x
377 km x 51.6 deg orbit; the orbit will be slowly lowered over the next
year prior to Mir's  deliberate reentry.

Recent Launches
---------------

The Japanese Planet-B probe has been renamed Nozomi ("Hope"). Nozomi is
a project of the Institute of Space and Astronautical Sciences (ISAS),
Japan's scientific space agency.  The M-V-3 launch vehicle took off from
Kagoshima Space Center; the third stage and payload entered a 146 x 417
km x 31.1 deg parking orbit. The KM-V1 kick (fourth) stage then fired to
place Nozomi in a 359 x 401491 km x 28.6 deg deep orbit, from which it
will make lunar and Earth gravity assist passes to increase its energy
for solar orbit insertion and the cruise to Mars. M-V-3 was the second
M-V launch (M-V-2, carrying the Lunar A probe, has been delayed).
Thanks to T. Imachi for information on the kick stage.

On Jul 7 at 0315 UTC Russia carried out the first satellite launch from
a submarine. The Shtil'-1 launch vehicle is a converted R-29RM (RSM-54)
three stage liquid propellant submarine launched ballistic missile made
by the Makeev design bureau; the satellite payload is placed in the
standard Shtil'  reentry vehicle. The launch plaform was the  K-407
`Novomoskovsk', a 667BDRM Del'fin class submarine of the Russian
Northern Fleet's 3rd Flotilla,  from a range in the Barents Sea off the
coast of the Kol'skiy Peninsula, at approximately 35.3 deg E 69.3 deg N.
This is the first orbital launch of a rocket from the GRTs KB Makeev and
the first orbital launch carried out by the VMF (Voenno-Morskiy Flot,
the Russian Navy).

The Shtil'-1 launched the German 8 kg Tubsat-N `nanosatellite' and its
companion 3 kg Tubsat-N1. Tubsat-N entered a 400 x 776 km x 78.9 deg
orbit.  Both Tubsat-N and Tubsat-N1 carry a small store-forward
communications payload which will be used to keep track of transmitters
placed on vehicles, migrating animals, and marine buoys.  They are
owned, operated and built by the Technische Universitat Berlin (TUB).
TUB's earlier satellites were Tubsat-A, launched on an Ariane in Jul
1991, and Tubsat-B, launched on an 11K68 Tsiklon-3 from Plesetsk in Jan
1994.  Thanks to Igor Lissov, Asif Siddiqi, Steve Zaloga and Veit
Zimmermann  for background info.

The 11K77 Zenit-2 launch vehicle returned to service on Jul 10 with the
launch of the Resurs-O1 No. 4 satellite from Baykonur. Resurs-O1, built
by VNII Elektromekhaniki and based on the Meteor weather satellites, is
a Russian civil remote sensing satellite analogous to the Landsats. The
satellite may also be designated Resurs-O2 No. 1 according to some
sources. As well as remote sensing equipment, the satellite carries the
Belgian LLMS (Little LEO Messaging System) communications payload for
the IRIS system. The satellite entered an 815 x 818 km x 98.8 deg
sun-synchronous orbit; the launch appears to have been fully successful.
This launch was critical in restoring confidence in the Zenit vehicle
prior to planned launches of Globalstar satellites from Baykonur and the
first Sea Launch flights using a three-stage Zenit. 

Four subsatellites were launched with Resurs-O1 No. 4.  They are
Fasat-Bravo, a 50 kg Microbus class test satellite built by Surrey
Satellite for the Chilean Air Force, Safir 2, a German space agency 60
kg relay satellite built by OHB System of Bremen, TMSAT, another Uosat
Microbus-class payload built by Surrey Satellite for the Thai
Microsatellite Co. of Bangkok and carrying a combined Earth observation
and data comms. payload, and Gurwin Techsat 1B, built by the
Technion-Israel Institute of Technology  and replacing an earlier
Techsat which failed to orbit in 1995.

The Kosmos-2359 recon satellite manuevered to its operational orbit of
240 x 302 km x 64.9 deg on Jun 27.

The Orihime and Hikoboshi satellites undocked and redocked on Jul 7
in its FP-1 test of automated docking systems. Despite the claims of
the NASDA space agency that this is a first, automated Russian craft have
docked on many occasions since the Kosmos-186/188 docking in 1968.

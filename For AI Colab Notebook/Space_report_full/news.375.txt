Shuttle and Mir
---------------

The next Shuttle mission is STS-95, with orbiter OV-103 Discovery.
For mission STS-95, Discovery's payload bay carries a Spacehab
module and an assortment of research experiments managed by NASA-Goddard
(GSFC).

 Bay Sill RMS Arm 202 with ACVS
 Bay 1-2  External Airlock  
 Bay 3-4  Tunnel Adapter 001
 Bay 5-7  Spacehab Single Module (FU1)
 Bay 8S   GABA with CRYOTSU
 Bay 10   SFSS with Spartan 201
 Bay 11   UASE with HOST
 Bay 12   MPESS HH-M with IEH-3 and PANSAT
 Bay 13S  APC? with IVHM
 Bay 13P  GABA with G-467 and G-779

The external airlock (EAL) is installed in Discovery for use in Space
Station docking missions, but the ODS docking system is not installed on
this flight. The Tunnel Adapter has a hatch in case an emergency
spacewalk is needed, and provides a pressurized tunnel connecting the
EAL to the Spacehab module.

The Spacehab module is flight unit 1, which has flown on 3 previous
missions (SH-01/STS-57, SH-03/STS-63, SH-04/STS-77). On this flight it
contains microgravity experiments, including the Microgravity Glovebox,
the PCAM and APCF protein crystal growth units, the STES vapor diffusion
unit, the ASP advanced separation facility, and the BioDyn commercial
bioreactor. DSO 630 includes equipment to monitor John Glenn's heart
rate.

ACVS is the Autotrack Computer Vision System, a new camera
system mounted on the RMS manipulator arm.

CRYOTSU consists of an HH-G avionics box and a GAS canister
mounted on a GABA (GAS Beam Adapter) on the payload bay wall.
The joint USAF/GSFC experiment tests new thermal control technology.

The SFSS (Spartan Flight Support Structure) is an MPESS bridge
across the payload bay. It carries two canisters: SEM-4
which is full of high school experiments, and VGS (Video Guidance
System) which includes a camera and laser for rendezvous experiments.
Mounted on the SFSS is the Spartan-201 satellite which will be
deployed and then retrieved by the RMS arm. Spartan-201
is on its fifth flight, a repeat of the fourth mission to support
SOHO calibration. The fourth mission failed when the crew did not
activate the satellite correctly.  Spartan-201's main payload,
as on all its flights, is the UVCS and WLC telescope package
containing the SAO/Cambridge ultraviolet spectrometer and the
HAO/Boulder white light coronagraph. On this mission, secondary
experiments include the target for the VGS laser, and sample
plates to trap beryllium ions from the solar wind.

Behind SFSS in the bay is the UASE, UARS Airborne Support Equipment,
a carrier first used to deploy the UARS satellite in 1991. It has
been refurbished to carry the HOST (Hubble Orbital Systems Test)
experiments. HOST includes the NICMOS infrared camera's new cooling
system, an advanced computer and a solid state recorder; the systems
are being tested in orbit before being installed on the Hubble
Space Telescope on a servicing mission in 2000.

The last major payload in the bay is the HH-M carrier, another MPESS
bridge, configured to carry the IEH-3 International Extreme Ultraviolet
Hitchhiker mission. IEH-3 carries the UVSTAR, STAR-LITE, SEH and SOLCON
astronomical telescopes and the G-764 canister with an experiment
to simulate accretion of interplanetary dust. It also carries the
PANSAT canister which will eject a small satellite (PANSAT = Petite
Amateur Navy Satellite) developed by the US Navy Postgraduate School.
PANSAT is a 57 kg, 0.48m diameter UHF store-forward comsat. It appears
similar to the GLOMR/SECS satellites launched in 1985 and 1990.
Some documents indicate that canister G-238, a high school
experiment to study cockroaches in space (I'm serious!) is also 
on IEH-3, while others list a materials processing experiment called
CONCAP-IV. One payload probably bumped the other at a late date, but
I'm not sure which one is current.

At the rear of the bay, another GABA adapter carries two GAS canisters.
G-467 carries the European Space Agency's TPX II thermal control system
experiment, while  G-779 carries Bellarmine College's 'Hearts in Space'
experiment, with an artificial heart and circulation system to study
changes in heart size in microgravity. On the opposite site
of the bay, an IVHM (Integrated Vehicle Health Monitoring) sensor
is mounted.

Editorial
---------

I've added a new `work in progress' web page giving details of the
French national space program, including previously unpublished
information on the French sounding rocket program courtesy of
CNES/Toulouse. Comments and corrections, as always, welcome.

Errata
-------

A couple of launches got missed from my new launch log
because they were rockets with no payloads aboard (e.g. early
Centaur test flights). I've updated the launchlog.txt file
to fix these and some other minor errors.

The Ariane V111 launch was a 44L model, with four PAL liquid
strapons, and not a 44LP as I said last issue. The Ariane 44L
is the most powerful version of Ariane 4. There have been
10 flights of the 44L with the improved H-10-3 upper stage,
listed below:

1995 Dec  6 V81  Insat 2C/Telecom 2C  
1996 Jan 12 V82  Measat 1/PAS 3R      
1996 May 16 V86  Palapa C2/Amos 1     
1996 Jul  9 V89  Turksat 1C/Arab. 2A  
1996 Aug  8 V90  Italsat 2/Telecom 2D 
1996 Nov 13 V92  Arab. 2B/Measat 2    
1997 Jan 30 V93  Nahuel 1A/GE-2       
1997 Jun  3 V97  Inmarsat 3/Insat 2D  
1997 Nov 12 V102 Sirius 2/Cakrawarta  
1998 Oct  5 V111 Eutelsat W2/Sirius 3

The (French) spelling of the home region of the CSG launch site is 
Guyane, not Guiane. The line in the list of launch sites should
have read
CSG      Centre Spatial Guyanais, Kourou, Guyane, France       05 14N 52 47W
where the revised position is that of the ELA2 pad.

Recent Launches
---------------

In a launch provided by International Launch Services, a Lockheed Martin
Astronautics Atlas IIA, serial AC-134, placed the Eutelsat Hot Bird 5
satellite in orbit on Oct 9. The second comsat launch for Eutelsat in a
few days, Hot Bird 5 is a Matra Marconi Space/Toulouse Eurostar 2000+.
It provides high power broadcasting to Europe, Africa and the Middle
East. Launch mass of the satellite was 3000 kg. 

The Atlas IIA took off from Space Launch Complex 36B at Cape Canaveral,
and the Atlas booster and sustainer delivered the Centaur IIA stage onto
a suborbital trajectory. The Centaur first burn placed the vehicle in a
low parking orbit, probably about 170 km, and the second burn raised
apogee to geostationary altitude. After separation from Hot Bird, the
Centaur made a final burn to deplete its propellant and prevent a later
explosion. Hot Bird 5 will use its Marquardt R-4D liquid apogee engine
to reach geostationary orbit, where it will replace Eutelsat II F-1.

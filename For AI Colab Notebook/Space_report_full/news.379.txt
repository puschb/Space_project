Shuttle, Mir and Station
------------------------

The Spartan 201 satellite was deployed from Discovery on Nov 1 and
retrieved on Nov 3. Spartan 201 is on its fifth mission to observe the
solar corona, and this time will be used to recalibrate the SOHO
satellite which recently resumed observations of the Sun.

Discovery landed at 1703:31 UTC Nov 7 on runway 33 at the Shuttle
Landing Facility.

On the Mir complex, crew Gennadiy Padalka and Sergey Avdeev are
unloading the Progress M-40 cargo ship docked at the rear
(+X, Kvant) docking port.

The launch of the Zarya module is scheduled for Nov 20 from complex 81L
at Baykonur (5-GIK) aboard a three-stage Proton-K (8K82K) launch
vehicle.

Errata
-------

The GE 5 satellite does not have C-band transponders; it
is a purely Ku-band satellite.

In recent editions of my geo.log file, the IDs for Turksat 1C
and Arabsat IIA were mistakenly exchanged. The files geo.log
and launchlog.txt have been corrected and updated.


Recent Launches
---------------

Panamsat's PAS 8 satellite was launched on Nov 4. An International
Launch Services Proton, built by Krunichev, placed the PAS 8 in orbit.
The Energiya Blok DM3 upper stage made two burns to deliver PAS 8 to a
6784 x 35941 km x 17.3 deg transfer orbit. PAS 8 is a Space
Systems/Loral FS-1300 satellite with 24 C-band and 24 Ku-band
transponders. It is due to be located over the Pacific after its R-4D
apogee engine raises the orbit to geostationary, and will provide
international communications services for Panamsat.

Boeing's Delta 2 launched five Iridium comsats into low earth orbit on
Nov 6. The new batch includes Iridium 2, one of three prototype
satellites now refurbished for flight. Launch of the Delta 7920 from
Vandenberg Air Force Base entered a 168 x 539 km x 86.4 deg parking
orbit, and then placed the five satellites in  a circular 516 x 530 km x
86.0 deg polar orbit, in plane 5 of the system. The second stage then
lowered its orbit to 243 x 512 km so that it will reenter quickly.

The ROSAT X-ray observatory ceased science observations in September
after accidentally pointing at the Sun again and burning out its
remaining camera. ROSAT was launched in June 1990 and operated
well beyond its original expected lifetime. Spacecraft controllers
in Germany are carrying out end-of-life tests with the satellite.

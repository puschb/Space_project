Shuttle and Station
------------------------

Launch of STS-88 was scrubbed at 0903 UTC on Dec 3 with an RSLS hold
at T-19 seconds. A problem with a hydraulic system sensor caused
a hold at T-4 min; the problem was resolved but the launch window
closed seconds before STS-88 would have lifted off.

Second try was the charm, with launch at 0835:34 UTC on Dec 4 placing
OV-105 Endeavour in a 75 x 313 km x 51.6 deg orbit. The RSRM-67 solid
boosters separated at 2 min into flight, with main engine cutoff after 8
minutes and separation of external tank ET-97 shortly after.
At 0919 UTC Endeavour fired its OMS engines to raise the orbit to
180 x 322 km x 51.6 deg.

On Dec 5 at 2225 UTC Nancy Currie unberthed Unity from the payload bay
using the RMS arm. By 2350 UTC Unity's PMA-2 port was docked to the
Orbiter Docking System. At this point OV-105 was in a 189 x 321 km x
51.6 deg orbit.  Next it was time for the rendezvous with
the FGB module. On Dec 6 at 2347 UTC Endeavour grappled Zarya
with the robot arm, and  at 0207 UTC on Dec 7 it was soft docked
to the PMA-1 port on Unity. After some minor glitches hard dock
was  completed at 0248 UTC. Unity and Zarya now form the core
of the future Station. Endeavour remains docked to the Station
pending spacewalks to attach exterior cables.


Erratum: STS-88 commander Cabana is of course "formerly NASA chief
astronaut", he stepped down in favor of Ken Cockrell in order to take
the STS-88 command chair.
Some corrections to the STS-88 payload bay manifest: there are a total
of four Portable Foot Restraints and two PFR handles stashed on opposite
sides of the bay in bay 5. The two TCS sensors are on separate carriers
in bays 6 and 7, so the manifest actually reads:

Sill:     RMS arm No. 303
Bay 1-2:  Tunnel Adapter 002
Bay 3-4:  Orbiter Docking System/External Airlock  (Boeing/Palmdale)
Bay 7-13: Unity (Node 1)         (Boeing/Huntsville)
          PMA-1 docking adapter  (Boeing/Huntingdon Beach), 
          PMA-2 docking adapter  (Boeing/Huntingdon Beach)

Bay 2  Port: GABA adapter with SAC-A satellite

Bay 4  Stbd: Carrier with Tool Stowage Assembly
Bay 5  Port: GABA adapter with two PFR spacewalk plaftorms and one 
                          PFR stanchion.
Bay 5  Stbd: GABA adapter with two more PFR spacewalk plaftorms and one 
                          PFR stanchion.
Bay 6  Port: GABA adapter with Mightysat
Bay 6  Stbd: APC carrier with TCS laser rendezvous sensor
Bay 7  Stbd: APC carrier with TCS laser rendezvous sensor
Bay 13 Port: GABA adapter with SEM-7 and G-093 canisters
Bay 13 Stbd: GABA adapter with IMAX Cargo Bay Camera

Recent Launches
---------------

The SWAS satellite was launched on Dec 6. SWAS, the Submillimeter Wave
Astronomy Satellite, is a Small Explorer mission and part of the Origins
program. The satellite has a 0.6m telescope with a 490 to 550 GHz
submillimeter receiver and an acousto-optical spectrometer. The
submillimeter band is rich in spectral lines from molecular clouds, and
SWAS will be used to study the cooling of molecular cloud cores, the
sites of star formation in our galaxy, by measuring lines from molecular
oxygen and water. Principal investigator for SWAS is Gary Melnick of the
Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory in Cambridge, Mass. Earlier SMEX
missions were SAMPEX, FAST, and TRACE. Congratulations to my colleagues
on the SWAS team!

The Orbital Sciences L-1011 Stargazer took off from Vandenberg AFB's
Runway 30/12 on Dec 3 carrying a Pegasus XL launch vehicle with the SWAS
astronomy satellite aboard. It reached the drop box at 36.0N 123.0W over
the Pacific; however, due to a software-related range problem the range
ordered the launch scrubbed and the L-1011 returned to base with
SWAS/Pegasus still attached. Nothing was wrong with the Pegasus or the
L-1011 and the launch was reset for Dec 4, but delayed due to weather.
On Dec 6, launch was successful.  The L-1011 took off at 2358 UTC on Dec
5 and reached the box at 36N 123W,  dropping the Pegasus at 0057 UTC on
Dec 6. SWAS reached a 637 x 652 km x 69.9 deg orbit and separated from
the third stage at 0109 UTC.

By my count Dec 3 was the fifth time a Pegasus has been scrubbed with
the carrier plane already in the air:
  1994 May 12  F-5  STEP 2 aborted T-27 seconds
  1994 Jun 23  F-6  STEP 1 aborted T-5 seconds
  1996 Aug 18  F-13 FAST   aborted T-11 minutes
  1996 Oct 30  F-14 SAC-B  aborted T-5 seconds
  1998 Dec  3  F-25 SWAS   aborted T-4 minutes


Arianespace Flight V114 roared into orbit on Dec 6 carrying the Satmex 5
satellite. The Ariane 42L rocket entered a 211 x 21516 km x 7.0 deg
subsynchronous orbit from which the Hughes HS-601HP satellite will use
its apogee engine to raise perigee and then apogee to reach
geostationary orbit. Satmex 5 is operated by Satellites Mexicanos S.A. de
C.V, a company (partly owned by Loral) which has taken over from the
Mexican Telecoms Ministry which operated the Morelos satellites. Satmex
5 will replace Morelos 2. The V114 launch preceded the Pegasus/SWAS
launch less than 15 minutes. Satmex 5 mass was 4135 kg at launch; I
don't have a figure for the dry mass. It carries the XIPS ion engine
stationkeeping system.

Shuttle and Station
------------------------

Endeavour is docked to the International Space Station, consisting of
PMA-2, Unity, PMA-1  and Zarya. The vehicles are in a 386 x 401 km x
51.6 deg orbit.

Ross and Newman made the first spacewalk to connect up cables with
Zarya. Hatch open on the Tunnel Adapter was at 2210 UTC on Dec 7, and
the airlock was repressurized at 0532 UTC on Dec 8. The second EVA, to
install antennas, was from Dec 9 at 2033 UTC to Dec 10 at 0335 UTC. A
third EVA was planned for Dec 12.

Erratum: I keep misspelling the location of the organization
formerly known as McDonnell Douglas. It is Huntington Beach,
not Huntingdon Beach. The Huntington Beach unit built the
PMA-1 and PMA-2 docking adapters used on the Station.

AXAF
----

The external tank for mission STS-93 has now been connected to the solid
rocket boosters. The AXAF observatory is still in California, and will
probably be shipped to Florida in January for a launch in March/April.

Recent Launches
---------------

Arianespace Flight V114 roared into orbit on Dec 6 carrying the Satmex 5
satellite. The Ariane 42L rocket entered a 211 x 21516 km x 7.0 deg
subsynchronous orbit from which the Hughes HS-601HP satellite will use
its apogee engine to raise perigee and then apogee to reach
geostationary orbit. Satmex 5 is operated by Satellites Mexicanos S.A. de
C.V, a company (partly owned by Loral) which has taken over from the
Mexican Telecoms Ministry which operated the Morelos satellites. Satmex
5 will replace Morelos 2. The V114 launch preceded the Pegasus/SWAS
launch less than 15 minutes. Satmex 5 mass was 4135 kg at launch; I
don't have a figure for the dry mass. It carries the XIPS ion engine
stationkeeping system.

The V114 launch preceded the Pegasus/SWAS launch by only 15 minutes.
Yet another Ariane launch is scheduled for Dec 21, carrying the PAS 6B
satellite.

Russia launched a Nadehzda navigation/search and rescue satellite on an
11K65M Kosmos-3M rocket from Plesetsk on Dec 10 into a 987 x 1045 km x 83
degree orbit. Attached to Nadezdha was the small Swedish Space
Corporation microsatellite Astrid-2. Astrid-2 was ejected at 1525 UTC.
Astrid-2 will measure the auroral electromagnetic fields and particle
environment. Mass is 30 kg.

The Mars Climate Orbiter was launched on a Boeing Delta 7425
on Dec 11. MCO is the second craft in the Mars Surveyor Program;
the first was Mars Global Surveyor, currently aerobraking in orbit
around Mars. MCO was built by Lockheed Martin Astronautics/Denver
and is a 338 kg craft (with a further 291 kg of fuel at launch)
consisting of an equipment module and a 640N Leros bipropellant
orbit insertion engine. MCO carries the MARCI color imager
for mapping and weather studies, the PMIRR radiometer, and a UHF
communications system which will relay data from Mars Polar Lander,
scheduled for launch in January. MCO will enter a 160 x 38600 km
polar orbit around Mars on 1999 Sep 23, and then use aerobraking
to reach a 373 x 437 km x 92.9 deg sunsynchronous mapping orbit
by 1999 Nov 23.

The science mission will map the surface at high resolution, and
study the distribution of water vapor and ozone. It also
will study the transport of dust and water with latitude,
the motions of weather systems and dust storms, and
study the response to daily solar heating.

MCO's Delta launch vehicle took off from Space Launch Complex 17 at Cape
Canaveral and entered a 185 x 198 km x 28.4 deg parking orbit. A second
Delta stage 2 burn raised apogee to around 900 km when the third stage
took over for the solar orbit insertion burn. For the first time, a
small solid Thiokol Star 37FM motor was used as the Delta third stage.
An older Star 37E motor was used in the 1970s as the standard third
stage, but was replaced by the much bigger Star 48 in the 1980s.
The Star 37E and MCO are in solar orbit; the Delta stage 2 was
left in a 162 x 857 km x 23.9 deg Earth orbit.

Meanwhile, Deep Space 1 has completed a two week long burn of
its NSTAR ion engine.

The satellites I listed earlier as Iridium 2 and Iridium 3 are actually
Iridium 87 and Iridium 78 respectively. The names used by Space Command
are system identifiers which will be reused (i.e. there'll be another
Iridium 3 someday replacing this one, so it's not a unique name) and not
the spacecraft production numbers. I'll be posting a detailed
constellation status in a forthcoming issue.

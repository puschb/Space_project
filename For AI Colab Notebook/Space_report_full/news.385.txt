Shuttle and Station
------------------------

The next Shuttle launch is STS-93, which will deploy the Chandra X-ray
Observatory. Columbia will be transferred to the Vehicle Assembly
Building in early February; Chandra flies from TRW's Redondo Beach plant
in California to Florida at the end of the month.

Recent Launches
---------------

A Krunichev Proton-K launch vehicle with an Energiya 11S861 DM-2 upper
stage placed three Uragan navigation satellites in orbit for the Russian
Ministry of Defence GLONASS system on Dec 30. The GLONASS satellites
operate in  19000 km circular orbits and are analogous to the US Navstar
GPS system; the Uragan spacecraft were designed by NPO PM of
Zheleznogorsk and built by Polyot of Omsk. The three satellites  are
Uragan Nos. 86, 84 and 79 (GLONASS numbers 786, 784 and 779), and are in
orbital plane 1, according to the KNITs web page.

NASA's Mars Polar Lander was launched on Jan 3 at 2021 UTC by a Boeing
Delta 7425 rocket. The first burn of the second stage placed it in a 157
x 245 km x 28.35 deg parking orbit. The second stage started again
around 2055 UTC and was follwed by the burn of the Star 48B third stage.
The third stage and MPL entered solar orbit, with third stage separation
at around 2102 UTC. The second stage was left in a 226 x 740 km x 25.8 deg
Earth orbit.

MPL is part of the Mars Surveyor program. It consists of a cruise stage
and a lander, built by Lockheed Martin Astronautics/Denver. Attached to
the cruise stage are two Deep Space 2 Mars Microprobes, penetrator
probes which will slam into the Martian surface a few hundred km away
from the MPL landing site. DS2 is part of NASA's New Millenium Program.
Both MPL and DS2 are managed by the Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena.

The LP team tell me that the report of a drift in Lunar Prospector's
inclination to 85 deg was a typo, and the actual orbit inclination
remains close to 90.0 degrees. 

Following its propulsion problems, ISAS' Nozomi probe will remain in
solar orbit until Dec 2003, entering Mars orbit four years late.


Launch Logs
-----------

I've updated the various launch logs in 
http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~jcm/space/log/

Several new launch times for early (1958-1962) Soviet satellites have
been added from recent Russian publications. Also, the Kosmos-2285
satellite launched in Aug 1994, which I flagged as an unusual mission in
JSR 206, is implicitly identified in a recent Russian book as Obzor No.
1, an experimental remote sensing satellite.

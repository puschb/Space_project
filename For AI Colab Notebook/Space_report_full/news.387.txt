Editorial
---------

The first issue of JSR was sent to an internal email distribution here
at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics on 1989 Jan 30, ten
years ago - I assumed only a few of my friends would be interested. The
name was intended to emphasize the informal nature of my ramblings, in
contrast to some of the more pompous and expensive newsletters out
there. I was persuaded to distribute it more widely, and was surprised
and astonished to see it grow to an audience of thousands - over 2800 on
the direct email list as of today, and many more via the WWW and
republication in other forms. Let me take this opportunity to express my
thanks to all of you who have  been kind enough to send me information,
corrections and encouragement over the years. I hope you will continue
to find JSR a useful source of information!

Shuttle and Station
------------------------

We're still waiting to hear how long the delay to STS-93 will be.
Engineers have examining the suspect circuit boards on the Chandra
observatory. I understand they seem to be almost all fine; we will go
ahead and fly Chandra to Kennedy Space Center on Feb 4 and make fixes at
the Cape. Nevertheless, because the Space Station mission STS-96 wants
to fly in May, we will not be able to launch until well after that.
Stay tuned for an official announcement on a new launch date.

The Mir space station remains in orbit with Gennady Padalka and Sergey
Avdeev aboard. The first of several orbit-raising burns was made on Jan
27. The Progress M-40 cargo craft will undock on Feb 4 and deploy the
25-m diameter Znamya-2.5 reflector, which may be visible from as a flash
brighter than the full Moon in various locations around the world (for
example at around 0h UTC on Feb 5 in Southern Canada).  The reflector,
attached to the nose of Progress, will reflect a patch of sunlight about
6km wide on the surface. Znamya-2.5 is developed by the Space Regatta
Consortium (SRC), led by the RKK Energiya company which operates Mir.
Mir commander Padalka will use the TORU manual control system to point
the reflector at the Earth. An earlier experiment, Znamya-2, was
carried out in Feb 1993. Astronomers have expressed concern about the
potential that experiments like Znamya may interfere with  observations
of the night sky. Although Znamya-2.5 itself isn't really a big deal,
the fact that there is currently no international regulation controlling
the launching of bright satellites which could destroy sensitive
astronomical detectors (or, as some have suggested, replace the romantic
night sky with orbiting billboards for Coke and Microsoft...) has led
the International Astronomical Union to oppose the Znamya-2.5 experiment
on the grounds of the precedent it would set.  SRC's long term idea is
that Znamya could lead to a constellation of huge space mirrors to
illuminate Arctic cities, which raises a lot of environmental, political
and practical concerns. Nevertheless, Znamya-2.5 is also an important
test of the technology of deployable large structures and solar sails,
with many useful potential applications, and presumably Energiya's main
intention is that the publicity will generate Western contracts for
further, less controversial, experiments with deployable structures
which would use their expertise.

Recent Launches
---------------

Lockheed Martin's Athena-1 serial LM-6 launch vehicle took off from
Spaceport Florida's pad at Cape Canaveral Air Station on Jan 27 and
placed Taiwan's first satellite in orbit. ROCSAT (Republic of China
Satellite) was built by TRW for Taiwan's National Space Program Office.
The Castor 120 first stage and Orbus 21D second stage entered suborbital
trajectories (the Orbus 21D probably just missed orbiting) and the
Primex OAM third stage burned to enter transfer orbit. After a second
OAM burn to circularize at apogee, ROCSAT separated into a 588 x 601 km
x 35.0 deg orbit.

ROCSAT carries a Ka-band experimental communications payload,
an ocean color imager experiment to study plankton distribution
for fisheries management, and an instrument to measure thermal
plasma in the equatorial ionosphere. It also has a small
hydrazine orbit adjust engine. Mass of the satellite is 400 kg.

Athena launches to date: (LLV-1 and LMLV-1 were earlier names for Athena-1)
 
Date        Serial   Type     Site     Payload
1995 Aug 15 DLV      LLV-1    V SLC6   Gemstar   (failed)
1997 Aug 23 LM-001   LMLV-1   V SLC6   Lewis
1998 Jan  7 LM-004   Athena-2 CC SLC46 Lunar Prospector
1999 Jan 27 LM-006   Athena-1 CC SLC46 Rocsat 


The Galileo probe made another flyby of Europa at 0210 UTC on Feb 1, at
an altitude of 1495 km. Lunar Prospector lowered its orbit again on Jan
29, to only 25 x 35 km above the lunar surface. Mars Global Surveyor is
completing its aerobraking, with orbit now 113 x 551 km x 93.1 deg
around Mars.

Erratum
-------

The small PANSAT satellite launched on STS-88 was developed by the Naval
Postgrad School at Monterey, not by the Naval Academy as implied in my
annual launch list.

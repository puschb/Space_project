The Hubble Space Telescope is in its Orbital Verification phase.
Focus tests are in progress but have been delayed by errors
in the Guide Star Catalog. High voltage testing of the
instruments has begun. First WF/PC image is due in about
a week.

Launch of STS-35/Columbia is due for about Jun 3 following
repairs to the orbiter cooling system.

Anatoli Solov'yov (Komandir) and Aleksandr Balandin (Bortinzhener)
continue in orbit aboard the Mir complex.  The Soyuz TM-9 transport and
the Progress-42 freighter are currently at the station.  
Solov'yov and Balandin have been in space for 92 days.

Two MACSAT (Multiple Access Comsat) lightsats were orbited by 
Scout G-1 from Space Launch Complex 5, Vandenberg AFB on May 9.
The satellites are a joint Navy/DARPA project.

Kosmos-2077, launched on May 7 from Plesetsk, is a film-return
imaging recon satellite with a life of two months.

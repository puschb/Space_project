Shuttle and Station
------------------------

Soyuz TM-29 was launched at 0418 UTC on Feb 20. The Soyuz-U (11A511U)
launch vehicle placed  spacecraft 7K-STM No. 78 (Soyuz TM-29) in orbit
nine minutes later. Crew commander is Viktor Afanas'ev of the Russian
Air Force, flight engineer is Jean-Pierre Haignere of the French space
agency CNES, and researcher-cosmonaut is Ivan Bella of Slovakia. Soyuz
TM-29 docked with Mir on Feb 22 at 0536 UTC. On Feb 27 EO-26 crew
commander Gennady Padalka and Ivan Bella entered Soyuz TM-28 and
undocked from the Kvant rear docking port at 2252 UTC, landing  in
Kazakstan at 0214 UTC on Feb 28. The new Mir crew, EO-27, is Viktor
Afanas'ev (Komandir), Sergey Avdeev (who was formerly on the EO-26
crew), (Bortinzhener) and Jean-Pierre Haignere (Bortinzhener-2). The
crew call sign is 'Derbent'.

The next Shuttle mission is STS-96, to the Space Station. STS-101,
scheduled for October, may be delayed if a new STS-103 Hubble servicing
mission is added to repair HST's flaky gyros.

Recent Launches
---------------

The much-delayed USAF Space Test Program P91-1 satellite, ARGOS, finally
got off the pad on Feb 23 on the 11th launch attempt. The Delta 7920
launch vehicle also placed two small subsatellites in orbit: Orsted for
Denmark and Sunsat for Stellenbosch University, South Africa. Orbit is
831 x 847 km x 98.7 deg. ARGOS carries an electric propulsion
experiment, ionospheric instruments, and a space dust experiment, as
well as NRL's USA hard X-ray astronomy detectors for X-ray binary star
timing observations. ARGOS was built by Boeing/Seal Beach (formerly
Rockwell). Orsted will map the Earth's magnetic field, and is managed
and operated by the Danmarks Meteorologiske Institut (Danish
Meteorological Institute) in Kobenhavn. The satellite's prime contractor
was CRI of Kobenhavn; mass is 62 kg. Sunsat was built by students at
Stellenbosch and carries a small imager and a message relay payload.

Arianespace completed its first 1999 launch with flight V116, delivering
Arabsat 3A and Skynet 4E to orbit on an Ariane 44L. Arabsat 3A is a
Spacebus 3000 built by Alcatel/Cannes for the Arab League. Launch mass
is 2708 kg and dry mass is 1200 kg; the satellite has 20 Ku-band
transponders and will be stationed at 26. It uses a DASA S400 liquid
apogee engine. Skynet 4E is a SHF/UHF military comsat for the UK
Ministry of Defense. It was built by Matra Marconi Space/Stevenage using
the old ECS bus. Launch mass is 1490 kg and dry mass is 759 kg; Skynet
4E has a Thiokol Star 30 solid apogee motor.

Russia launched a Krunichev Proton-K rocket from Baykonur on Feb 28,
carrying the Globus No. 14 (Raduga-1) Russian Defense Ministry comsat to
geostationary orbit.  The Globus series is an improved version of the
old Gran' (Raduga) satellite first launched in 1975; the satellites are
build by NPO Prikladnoi Mekhaniki in Zheleznogorsk, near Krasnoyarsk.
The upper stage, which made two burns to place the Raduga-1 in
geosynchronous orbit, is probably an Energiya Blok DM-2 (11S861); the
first test flight of Krunichev's Briz-M upper stage is due soon, but I
don't think it was this flight.

The WIRE infrared astronomy satellite is due for launch on Mar 1.

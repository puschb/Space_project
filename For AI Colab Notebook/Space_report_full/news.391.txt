Shuttle and Station
------------------------

The EO-27 crew of Afanas'ev, Avdeev and Haignere are aboard the Mir
complex. Paolo D'Angelo sent me some information about Ivan Bella, the
Slovak visitor to Mir last month, that I haven't seen elsewhere: Bella
is a Colonel in the Slovak Republic Army and was born 1964 May 21 at
Brezno. (sigh... I hate it that astronauts are now starting to be
younger than me...:-))

The ISS complex remains in automatic flight awaiting Shuttle mission
STS-96. Discovery will fly to the ISS and install some equipment.
After STS-96, it looks like Discovery may be recycled for an STS-103
Hubble repair mission in October.


Recent Launches
---------------

NASA's WIRE (Wide Field Infrared Explorer) astronomy satellite was
launched on Mar 5, but the mission ran into serious trouble shortly
after orbit injection. Some reports indicate the cover of WIRE's solid
hydrogen telescope was ejected prematurely, and a significant fraction
of the cryogen was vented, spinning up the satellite. The tumbling
satellite is continuing to lose power and cryogen; attempts to save the
mission are continuing, but the outlook doesn't seem encouraging - even
if they get it back, the duration of the mission will be shorter than
planned. WIRE was going to make an infrared photometry survey,
generating a large catalog of galaxies and quasars. I was really looking
forward to seeing the science from WIRE, and hope that NASA will decide
to fly a replacement if the current mission can't be saved.

The Orbital Sciences L-1011 Stargazer launch aircraft took off from
Vandenberg's runway 30/12 at 0155 UTC on Mar 2 carrying the WIRE
astronomy satellite. However, at the drop point at 123 W 36 N over the
Pacific, the planned 0256 UTC launch was cancelled at T-46 seconds
because of a problem with  the tail fin release mechanism, and the
L-1011 returned to Vandenberg with WIRE still attached. On the second
attempt on Mar 5, takeoff was again at 0155 UTC and launch at 0256 UTC 
this time went smoothly, with the three stage Pegasus XL rocket
delivering WIRE to a 539 x 587 km x 97.5 deg orbit.

WIRE was the fifth Small Explorer (SMEX) mission; SMEX missions
are managed by NASA-Goddard.
 SMEX missions:
 SMEX 1  SAMPEX   1992 Jul  3    Solar and Magnetospheric Particles Explorer
 SMEX 2  FAST     1996 Aug 21    Fast Auroral Snapshot Explorer
 SMEX 3  TRACE    1998 Apr  2    Transition Region and Coronal Explorer
 SMEX 4  SWAS     1998 Dec  6    Submillimeter Wave Astronomy Satellite
 SMEX 5  WIRE     1999 Mar  5    Wide Field Infrared Explorer


X-38 atmospheric test vehicle V-132 made its first flight at 1617 UTC on
Mar 5, dropped from carrier plane NB-52 No. 008 above Edwards AFB. V-132
glided under a parafoil to a landing on the lakebed after a 9 minute
flight. V-132 tests the rudders and flaps; the simpler V-131, which made
two drop tests earlier, tested the parafoil control system. They are
subscale models of the X-38 spacecraft. The first full scale X-38 will
be V-133, and the first space flight article will be V-201, which will
fly on a Shuttle mission next year.

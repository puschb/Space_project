Human spaceflight
-------------------

The EO-27 crew of Afanas'ev, Avdeev and Haignere are aboard the Mir
complex. Progress cargo ship No. 241 is being prepared for launch at
Baykonur and will become Progress M-41 after launch. Discovery is being
prepared for the STS-96 mission to the International Space Station (ISS).
Launch date now looks like May 24, as Boeing Delta has the range for May
20 for FUSE.

The cargo bay manifest of Discovery for STS-96 is:

Bay 1-2:     Orbiter Docking System/External Airlock
Bay 1 Port:  Tool Stowage Assembly
Bay 1 Stbd:  Tool Stowage Assembly
Bay 3-4:     Tunnel Adapter S/N 001
Bay 5-7:     Spacehab Tunnel
Bay 5:       Keel Yoke Device (KYD) and
             Integrated Cargo Carrier (ICC)
Bay 8-12:    Spacehab Logistics Double Module
Bay 13 Port: Adapter Beam (ABA) with IVHM
Bay 13 Stbd: Adapter Beam (ABA) with SVF/Starshine
Sill:        RMS Arm S/N 303

The Orbiter Docking System (ODS) and External Airlock (EAL), built by
Boeing/Palmdale, will be used to dock to the PMA-2  docking port on the
ISS. The EAL connects to the Tunnel Adapter (TA) which contains an
airlock hatch for EVAs. The TA in turn connects to the Spacehab Tunnel,
which I believe was built by Boeing/Huntington Beach (did I spell that
right for once?) and is similar to the Spacelab Tunnel hardware. The
Spacehab Tunnel in turn leads to the Spacehab Logistics Double Module. The
Spacehab-DM structure was built by Alenia/Torino and is owned by
Spacehab, Inc. It contains supplies and equipment for ISS.

The Keel Yoke Device props up the Spacehab, Inc. ICC (Integrated Cargo
Carrier) which sits above the Spacehab Tunnel. The ICC is a pallet which
carries two cranes: NASA's OTD (Orbital Replacement Unit Transfer
Device) and Russia's Strela. The cranes will be installed on ISS. It
also carries the SHOSS (Spacehab Oceaneering Space Systems) Box.
(Oceaneering Space Systems is a Houston company, I don't know what
the box is for).

The adapter beam in Bay 13 port carries the IVHM vehicle health
monitoring system, which is being checked out for operational use. The
Bay 13 Starboard adapter beam carries two experiments, SVF and
Starshine. SVF (Shuttle Vibration Forces) measures vibrations during
launch. Starshine, in the forward position on the beam, is a satellite
which will be ejected into orbit as a visual target to be used by
students for educational exercises.

STS-96 commander is Cmdr. Kent Rominger, USN, pilot is Lt Col Rick
Husband, USAF. Mission specialists are MS1 Dr. Tamara Jernigan (NASA),
MS2 Dr. Ellen Ochoa (NASA), MS3 Dr. Daniel Barry, MD (NASA), MS4 Julie
Payette (Canadian Space Agency), and MS5 Pol. Valeriy Tokarev, VVS
(Russian Space Agency). Jernigan and Barry will make a spacewalk.

Recent Launches
---------------

The first Boeing Sea Launch mission was a success. The Zenit-3SL launch
vehicle took off from the Sea Launch Odyssey mobile platform at 154.0W
0.0N on Mar 28.  DemoSat carries launch vehicle instrumentation and is a
dynamic model of an HS-702 satellite. Its mass is about 4500 kg. DemoSat
was built by Boeing Commercial Space/Kent. The first two stages of the
Zenit are built by Yuhznoe in the Ukraine. The third stage is a Blok
DM-SL, built by Energiya/Kaliningrad and based on the Blok DM series
used for Proton upper stages. Its first burn placed it in a 180 x 735 km
x 1.2 deg parking orbit 13 min after launch, followed by a second burn
47 min after launch to deliver DemoSat to a 638 x 36064 km x 1.2 deg
geostationary transfer orbit. Three hours later, a third DM-SL burn was
due to lower the rocket stage's orbit so that it will reenter quickly
(I haven't had confirmation on this burn yet).

Asiasat 3S was launched on Mar 21 by International Launch Services on a
Krunichev Proton-K with an Energiya Blok DM3 upper stage. Asiasat, based
in Hong Kong, will operate the satellite as a replacement for Asiasat 3,
which was placed in the wrong orbit by a Proton launch in 1997.  Asiasat
3, renamed HGS-1, is currently in inclined geostationary drift orbit
awaiting customers, after completing a remarkable pair of trips around
the Moon last year. The new satellite, Asiasat 3S, is a copy of its
precursor. It is a Hughes HS-601HP with C and Ku band transponders. Mass
in transfer orbit is 3463 kg, down to 2500 kg at beginning of life. The
Blok DM3 placed Asiasat 3S in a 9677 x 35967 km x 13.1 deg transfer
orbit. Asiasat's Marquardt R4D apogee engine will be used to raise
perigee to geostationary altitude.

WIRE is now stable; although its primary mission was a failure,
it will be used for systems tests. 

Pedantic correction on last week's pedantic note: Chinese scholars tell
me that  Chunghua would be Zhonghua in Pinyin, not Zhongguo, and refers
to China and things Chinese in the abstract.

Human spaceflight
-------------------

On the Mir orbital station, Viktor Afanas'ev and Jean-Pierre Haignere
made  a spacewalk on Apr 16 for 6h 19m during which Haignere launched 
by hand the Sputnik-99 amateur radio satellite. The satellite
was delivered by Progress M-41 in April; apparently the backup
Sputnik-40 is still stored on the station. The spacewalk began at 0437
UTC (0837 Moscow local time) and the hatch was closed at 1056 UTC.  The
satellite deployment was probably around 1030 UTC, but if anyone has an
accurate time please send it to me.

Sputnik-99 is at the center of a controversy over use of the amateur
radio band. The satellite was developed by AMSAT-F and AMSAT-R the
French  and Russian amateur radio satellite groups, with help from the
Russian Space Agency's flight control center, TsUP.  Apparently TsUP
made the mistake of arranging with a commercial company for messages to
be broadcast from the satellite including a trademarked advertising
slogan, a flagrant misuse of the amateur radio band. At the last moment
it was decided to launch the satellite without turning it on, avoiding
breaking ITU regulations but at the cost of losing the original amateur
radio mission. 

Space Command has given the satellite the designation 1999-21A, which
would be a big change to the way international designations (stricly the
province of the ICSU Committee on Space Research) are allocated.
Normally the '21' would refer to the 21st launch from the Earth's
surface in 1999. Sputnik-99 (called Sputnik Jr. 3 by Space Command, a
name they seem to have made up) was delivered to Mir by Progress M-41
Under the traditional scheme, the satellite would be
designated 1999-15C (3rd object cataloged from the Progress M-41 launch)
or 1986-17NG (yet another  object from the Mir launch). Other objects
released into space during the same spacewalk were designated 1986-17MZ
to 1986-17NF. It's perfectly reasonable for COSPAR to change the rules
and count launches 'from a space station' as a new launch, and although
I doubt that Space Command has the formal international authority to
make such a rule change on its own, in practice I suspect others will
follow along. It will be interesting to see if the new rule is applied
consistently, and not clear why the debris gets a 1986-17 label but
the payload gets the 1999-21 label.

Discovery was moved to the VAB on Apr 16. Columbia took its
parking spot in OPF bay 1. We don't know yet how the failure of the
IUS (see below) will affect the launch date for STS-93 (the Chandra
observatory uses the IUS to get to a highly elliptical orbit) but
we are crossing our fingers and hoping the situation will be resolved
speedily.

Recent Launches
---------------

Titan 4B-27 was launched on Apr 9 at 1701 UTC, the first Lockheed Martin
Titan 4 launch since last August's failure. The SRMU-8 solid motors and
K-32 two-stage liquid Titan core vehicle worked well, placing the DSP
F19 payload and its Boeing IUS-21 upper stage vehicle in a 188 x 718 km
x 28.6 deg parking orbit. The IUS is a two stage system; the first
stage, SRM-1, using a UTC Orbus 21 solid motor, burned at 1814 UTC and
increased apogee to geostationary altitude and separated. The SRM-2
stage was then meant to fire its Orbus 6E solid motor at 2334 UTC to
lower inclination and increase perigee, placing DSP in a circular
geosynchronous orbit. However, something went wrong: because the orbital
data is classified, it's not clear whether SRM-2 did not fire at all or
whether the burn was incomplete, but in any case DSP remained in an
orbit far from geosynchronous, and is reportedly tumbling out of
control. This is the first serious failure of the IUS since an April
1983 mission left the TDRS 1 satellite in a low orbit.  The Titan's
payload is a TRW Defense Support Program missile early warning satellite
with an infrared telescope to detect rocket launches. 

Eutelsat W3 was launched by Atlas from Canaveral on Apr 12. The W3
satellite is an Alcatel Spacebus 3000B2 model for the European
Telecommunications Satellite Organization. The Lockheed Martin Atlas
IIAS vehicle entered a 153 x 385 km x 27.4 deg parking orbit nine
minutes after launch. The second Centaur stage burn then delivered the
satellite to a 166 x 46076 km x 19.7 deg transfer orbit. W3 will be
stationed at 7E and carries 24 Ku-band transponders with a wide beam
covering Europe, N Africa and Asia, and a spot beam for digital TV to
Turkey.

Four more Globalstar satellites were launched by Soyuz-U/Ikar from
Baykonur on Apr 15. The third Soyuz-U/Ikar flight followed the same
profile as the last one, and delivered the four spacecraft to a 900 x
950 km x 52.0 deg parking orbit. The on-board propulsion systems will
raise the orbit of each satellite to the 1410 km operating altitude. The
Blok-I stage entered a 234 x 900 km transfer orbit; the 50KS Ikar stage 
deorbited itself after one day. The new satellites are M19, M42, M44 and
M45. Globalstar satellites, built by Alenia and Loral, are L-band
comsats which will provide satellite phone service. 20 Globalstar
satellites are now in orbit after two Delta and three Soyuz-U/Ikar
launches (12 more satellites were lost in a Zenit-2 failure).

The Landsat 7 remote sensing satellite was launched by Delta from
Vandenberg on Apr 15. NASA's new remote sensing satellite will be
operated by NASA/Goddard until Oct 2000, when operations will be
transferred to the US Geological Survey. Its single instrument is the
Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), a scanning radiometer with visible
and infrared bands giving 30-meter resolution in the visible bands and
15-m resolution in black and white. Launch mass was 1969 kg. The 
spacecraft was built by Lockheed Martin/Valley Forge, using a design
derived from the Tiros-N/DMSP weather satellites. The Boeing Delta
7920-10 launch vehicle entered a 175 x 706 km x 98.2 deg initial orbit,
then 57 min after launch circularized the orbit to 668 x 698 km and
deployed Landsat 7. After the depletion burn, the Delta stage ended up
in a  184 x 710 km x 107.5 deg orbit.

Surrey Satellite's UoSAT-12 spacecraft was placed in orbit with the
first launch of Russia's Dnepr rocket. The Dnepr is a converted R-36M2
(15A18M) ballistic missile (NATO codename SS-18 mod 4), developed by the
Yuzhnoye (Pivdenne) organization in the Ukraine and marketed by MK
Kosmotras. The R-36M2 is a  two stage launch vehicle; both stages use
nitrogen tetroxide and  UDMH (unsymmetrical dimethyl hydrazine). The
vehicle is 3.0m in diameter. A third stage, probably the S5M used on
Tsiklon-3, will usually be added, but it wasn't on this test mission
which doesn't involve the full Dnepr configuration. The Dnepr was
launched from a silo (sources tell me it is probably LC108) at GIK-5,
the Baykonur spaceport and delivered UoSAT-12
to a 638 x 652 km x 64.6 deg orbit. The final stage
appears to have made some kind of depletion burn and is being tracked in
a 599 x 1403 km x 64.6 deg orbit. UoSAT-12 is the first test of the
Minibus platform, at 325 kg a larger spacecraft than earlier 50 kg
Surrey UoSATs. It carries a  mobile radio experiment (MERLION), a GPS
receiver, and imaging cameras. 

Space Command have also cataloged SNAP-1, a 2.5 kg Surrey Nanosatellite
Applications Program test of micro-electromechanical systems which was
intended to be launched with UoSAT-12. However, Stefan Barensky informs
me that his sources indicate SNAP-1 was not actually aboard the launch
and is to be launched later in the year. I'll try and clarify this
situation next week.

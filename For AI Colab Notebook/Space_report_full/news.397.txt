Human spaceflight
-------------------

Commander Viktor Afanas'ev, flight engineer Sergey Avdeev and flight
engineer-2 Jean-Pierre Haignere remain on board the Mir complex. (For
some reason I forgot to include Avdeev last week). The Soyuz TM-29
transport craft and the Progress M-41 cargo ship are docked to the
complex.

Launch of STS-96 is still due May 20. Launch of STS-93 is no
earlier than Jul 22.

Recent Launches
---------------

Four failures in a row: Ikonos/Athena, ABRIXAS, Titan/Milstar, Delta/Orion.

* Milstar

Another Titan 4 failure occurred on Apr 30: Milstar 2 F-1 went into the
wrong orbit. It appears the Centaur upper stage may have malfunctioned,
carrying out its three burns at the wrong time.

The third Milstar satellite was launched on Apr 30 from Cape Canaveral.
Launch vehicle was a Lockheed Martin Astronautics (Denver) Titan 4B,
serial B-32. The Alliant SRMU solid motors ignited at 1630 UTC to begin
the launch, and fell away two minutes later with the first stage of the
Titan 4 core vehicle (serial K-36) igniting. At 9 minutes into the
flight the second stage of the core vehicle fell away and the first burn
of the upper stage began. The upper stage on this mission is Centaur
TC-14.  Three burns of TC-14 were planned to place Milstar successively
in a 170 x 190 km parking orbit, a geostationary transfer orbit, and
finally geosynchronous orbit. Instead, at 1900 UTC, several hours before
the scheduled third burn, Milstar separated from TC-14 in a 740 x 5000
km orbit, probably inclined at about 28 degrees. It seems that TC-14
made three burns, but all during the first orbit instead of over a 6
hour period, possibly due to software problems of some kind. The two
Pratt and Whitney RL-10A-3-3A LOX/LH2 engines have a
thrust of about 73 kN. The RL-10 was developed for the Saturn I and
Atlas Centaur in the 1960s, and was used on the DC-X test vehicle. The
Delta III uses an RL10B-2 version.

Milstar-2 F1 is the first upgraded Milstar (Military Strategic and
Tactical Relay System) comsat. The two Milstar-1 satellites already
launched carried the LDR (Low Data Rate) payload which is inadequate for
modern needs; Milstar-2 carries an extra MDR (Medium Data Rate) payload
with a higher throughput. The payload includes EHF (44 GHz), SHF (20
GHz) and UHF communications transponders and satellite-to-satellite
crosslinks, with narrow beams to avoid jamming.  Milstar is built by
Lockheed Martin/Sunnyvale and managed by the Milstar JPO at USAF Los
Angeles AFB.

 Centaur (Titan 4 model) flight history:
  TC-12 1994 Feb  7 Milstar-1 F1       Success
  TC-10 1994 May  3 NRO                Success
  TC-11 1994 Aug 27 NRO                Success
  TC-17 1995 May 14 NRO                Success
  TC-8  1995 Jul 10 NRO                Success
  TC-13 1995 Nov  6 Milstar-1 F2       Success
  TC-15 1996 Apr 24 NRO                Success
  TC-21 1997 Oct 15 Cassini/Huygens    Success
  TC-16 1997 Nov  8 NRO                Success
  TC-18 1998 May  9 NRO                Success
  TC-9  1998 Aug 12 NRO                No Test
  TC-14 1999 Apr 30 Milstar-2 F1 (*)   Failure

Note: TC-1 to TC-7 were a different Centaur model,  the Centaur D-1T.
The Titan 4/Centaur doesn't seem to have a model designation, but is
derived from the Centaur G-Prime design. TC-9 was destroyed during
launch, prior to separation from the core vehicle. It's not clear if any
of these Centaurs are the ones refurbished from the Shuttle/Centaur
program. A Centaur G' was prepared for flight in early 1986 on the
Shuttle, but launch was cancelled after the loss of OV-099 Challenger.

* Orion 3/Delta 3

Continuing the rash of upper stage failures, the second launch of Delta
3 also ran into trouble on May 5. The Delta second stage failed to
operate properly on its second burn. The engine ignited briefly, a spike
in pump pressure was recorded and the burn cutoff after only 1 second.
The Orion 3 payload ended up in the parking orbit of 162 x 1378 km x
29.5 deg, very close to the planned post SECO-1 (first burn) orbit. A
piece of debris is being tracked in a 171 x 1038 km x 29.4 deg orbit.
The Delta 3 uses an Pratt and Whitney  RL-10B-2 LH2/LOX engine in a stage
of a new design. The first Delta 3 launch failed shortly after
takeoff last year; at least this flight verified the basic operation
of the rocket.

Orion 3 is a Hughes HS-601HP satellite designed to serve the Asia-Pacific
region for Loral Orion. The satellite is owned by Hughes Space and Comms
International pending on-orbit delivery. It has 33 Ku-band and 10 C-band
transponders. 

* ABRIXAS

Sadly, the ABRIXAS satellite's battery has failed and contact with it
was lost on May 1. There is some hope that a period of solar
illumination next month will allow contact to be regained.

* DSP-19/IUS-21

The USAF reports that the two stages of IUS-21 failed to separate
correctly: at least one connector remained attached after the attempted
separation. The SRM-2 nozzle did not extend properly, possibly because
SRM-1 hit the nozzle during the incomplete separation. SRM-2 did fire,
but the vehicle tumbled during the burn. USAF have still not announced
the final orbit achieved.

* S5M 

25 new objects, 1989-100AR to 1989-100BR,  have been cataloged as
associated with the disintegration of the S5M upper stage of the
Tsiklon-3 launch vehicle used to  put Kosmos-2053 in orbit. Kosmos-2053
was launched by a Tsiklon-3 from Plesetsk  in 1989 and is believed to be
a modernized version of the Romb satellite, built by NPO Yuzhnoe. The
satellites carry an array of small ESO (Calibration Spherical Object)
subsatellites which are released over a period of time to test Russian
radars. 36 such objects (the full normal complement) were released
between 1989 Dec 27 and 1991 Nov 1, getting designations 1989-100C to
1989-100AQ (note that 1989-100W was the same object as 1989-100Y).
Kosmos-2053 reentered in 1997; the S5M is in a 471 x 485 km x 73.5 deg
orbit.


* Jinx at Space Launch Complex 6

It has been pointed out to me that Vandenberg's Space Launch Complex 6,
which was built on an old Native American burial ground, has never had
a success after many billions of dollars spent on the launch complex. 
 1960s: Built for USAF/NRO Manned Orbiting Laboratory, program cancelled
        before first launch.
 1980s: Refurbished for West Coast Shuttle launches, abandoned before
        first launch.
 1995:  First Athena launch, failed
 1997:  Athena launched Lewis satellite; satellite failed after
        orbit insertion
 1999:  Third Athena launch from SLC-6, failed again.

Joe Fanning tells me local legend has it that the tribe held a special
ceremony to curse the pad when it was first built. Coincidence? :-) 

Meanwhile, the status of US expendable launch vehicles is:
- Titan 4: three failures in three missions for different reasons:
    A-20/TC-9   - bad wiring in Lockheed Martin/Denver K-17 core stage
    B-27/IUS-21 - Boeing/Seattle IUS-21 bad separation of SRM-1 from SRM-2
    B-32/TC-14  - possible software problem in LM/Denver Centaur TC-14 stage
- Athena:
    LM-005: -  Dumped payload in ocean when fairing didn't separate
- Pegasus:
    M-22: - Minor (?) yaw anomaly on recent flight delayed next attempt
- Delta III: 
    D-268: - Boeing/Pueblo second stage, 
             problem on Pratt and Whitney RL-10B-2 engine
- Delta II:   Delta II in good shape?
- Atlas II:   In good shape except that upper stage uses RL-10 engine.

The Atlas II and the Delta II are the mainstay of commercial satellite
launches and the direct rivals to Ariane, so things are not quite as
bad as they might seem. However, if US companies can't launch the
existing vehicles safely, they will have to do some convincing to sell
flights on the upcoming replacements, Atlas V and Delta IV.

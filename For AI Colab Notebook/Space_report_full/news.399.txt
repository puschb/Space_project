Human spaceflight
-------------------

NASA is preparing to launch mission STS-96 to the International Space
Station on May 27. Orbiter OV-103 Discovery will be crewed by  commander
Kent Rominger (Cdr. USN), pilot Rick Husband (Lt-Col USAF), and mission
specialists Dr. Tamara Jernigan, Dr Ellen Ochoa and Dr. Daniel Barry of
NASA, Julie Payette of the Canadian Space Agency, and Valeriy Tokarev
(Col. VVS) of the Russian Air Force.

Discovery will dock with PMA-2 at one end of the PMA-2/Unity/PMA-1/Zarya
stack. The crew will transfer equipment from the Spacehab Logistics
Double Module in the payload bay to the interior of the station. Tammy
Jernigan and Dan Barry will make a spacewalk to transfer equipment from
the payload bay to the exterior of the station. The ODS/EAL
docking/airlock truss carries two TSA (Tool Stowage Assembly) packets
with spacewalk tools. The Integrated Cargo Carrier (ICC), built by
Energiya and DASA-Bremen, carries parts of the Strela crane and the US
OTD crane as well as the SHOSS box which contains three bags of tools
and equipment to be stored on ISS's exterior (my statement in JSR 394
that the SHOSS unit was a refrigerator was a confusion with another
device being built by the SHOSS group for ISS).  

The STS-96 payload bay manifest (repeated from JSR 393) is:
Bay 1-2:     Orbiter Docking System/External Airlock
Bay 3-4:     Tunnel Adapter S/N 001
Bay 5-7:     Spacehab Tunnel
Bay 5:       Keel Yoke Device (KYD) and
             Integrated Cargo Carrier (ICC)
Bay 8-12:    Spacehab Logistics Double Module
Bay 13 Port: Adapter Beam (ABA) with IVHM
Bay 13 Stbd: Adapter Beam (ABA) with SVF/Starshine
Sill:        RMS Arm S/N 303

The STS-96 stack, on mobile launcher 2, has been rolled back out to pad
39B, and the hail damage to the external tank has been repaired. The
STS-93 stack is back in VAB high bay 1 on mobile launcher 1, and the
STS-99 stack is being assembled in high bay 3 on mobile launcher 3.

Viktor Afanas'ev, Sergey Avdeev and Jean-Pierre Haignere remain on board
the Mir complex. The Soyuz TM-29 transport craft and the Progress M-41
cargo ship are docked to the complex.


Recent Launches
---------------

A classified NRO satellite was launched on May 22 by Lockheed Martin
Titan 4B flight B-12 from Vandenberg's Space Launch Complex 4-East. This
is the first successful Titan launch in 4 attempts (although the last
two failures were upper stage problems, and this flight didn't have an
upper stage). The payload had been reported to be a radar imaging recon
satellite built by Lockheed Martin/Denver and previously codenamed
LACROSSE. However apparently the short 50' fairing was used instead of
the 66 foor fairing used by LACROSSE. Florida Today reports the 50' 
fairing hasn't been used before, but my notes indicate it was used for
an imaging Improved CRYSTAL satellite launched in Nov 1992 - can anyone
confirm or refute? If the launch was to a 66 deg or 57 deg orbit, the
payload was probably related to the ocean surveillance triplets, but if
the launch was to a 97 degree orbit then the payload was most likely an
Improved CRYSTAL derivative.

The Terriers and MUBLCOM satellites were launched on May 18 by an
Orbital Sciences Corp. Pegasus XL/HAPS vehicle. The L-1011 Stargazer
aircraft took off from Vandenberg's runway 30/12 at 0412 UTC on May 18
and headed to the drop box over the Pacific at 36.0N 123.0W. Stargazer
dropped the Pegasus at 0509 UTC and the first stage solid motor ignited
five seconds later. At 0518 UTC the third stage motor (cataloged as
1998-26C) burned out and separated, leaving the payload stack in a 405 x
548 km x 97.7 deg orbit. The PRIMEX HAPS-Lite stage then made the first
burn of its hydrazine engine and entered a 540 x 553 km x 97.7 deg
orbit. The box-shaped Terriers satellite was deployed at 0520 UTC. A
minute later the conical Payload Adapter Fitting (1998-26E) was jettisoned,
leaving the disk-shaped MUBLCOM satellite attached to HAPS. The second
HAPS burn at 0522 UTC raised apogee to 775 km, followed by a third,
apogee burn at 0610 UTC which circularized the orbit. MUBLCOM was
deployed to a 769 x 776 km x 97.7 deg orbit. The final HAPS burn then
placed the depleted HAPS stage (1998-26D) in a lower 388 x 722 km x 97.1
deg disposal orbit.

TERRIERS is part of NASA's Student Explorer Demonstration Initiative
(STEDI), which was a precursor program to the UNEX (University Explorer)
series now in preparation. STEDI was managed by USRA (the Universities
Space Research Association) for NASA, while UNEX will be more directly
managed by NASA-GSFC. TERRIERS will be operated by the space physics
group at Boston University for ionospheric studies, and carries TESS, a
set of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) spectrographs to get electron density
and thermospheric emission profiles. The GISSMO instrument will measure
the solar EUV flux. The spacecraft was built by AeroAstro and based on
HETE.

TERRIERS was placed in the correct orbit, but it failed to orient its
solar panel to the Sun and ran out of battery power by May 20.
Controllers are optimistic that when its orbit precesses to a better sun
angle the satellite will revive and the mission can continue.

MUBLCOM (Multiple beam Beyond Line-of-sight Communications) is an
experimental satellite funded by DARPA and managed by the US Army's
Communications-Electronics Command (CECOM) at Ft Monmouth, New Jersey.
It was built by Orbital using the Microstar (Orbcomm type) bus and
carries a payload testing hand-held radio satellite communications for
the armed forces.

Telesat Canada's Nimiq television broadcasting satellite was launched by
an International Launch Services Proton on May 21. The Krunichev
Proton-K with an Energiya Blok DM3 upper stage placed the Lockheed
Martin/Sunnyvale A2100-class Nimiq satellite in a 7050 x 35790 x 15.9
deg transfer orbit. The A2100 will use its liquid apogee engine
(probably a Royal Ordnance Leros 1) to reach geostationary orbit.
Telesat Canada also operates the Anik Canadian domestic comsats, the
first of which was launched in 1972.

Erratum
-------

The CZ-4B rocket uses N2O4 (nitrogen tetroxide) and not LOX (liquid
oxygen) as its oxidizer.

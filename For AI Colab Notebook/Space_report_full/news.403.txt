STS-93/Chandra
---------------

4 days to launch... Chandra is now in Columbia's payload bay at pad
39B. We're looking forward to finally launching this thing just after
midnight on Monday night.
 
The Columbia crew will deploy Chandra in low orbit. The two IUS
solid motors will fire to place it in elliptical orbit, and then
Chandra's own liquid propulsion system will make several burns
to raise the orbit to 10000 km x 140000 km. We'll spend a few days
checking out the spacecraft and the instruments, and about 20 days
after launch we'll pop open the sunshade door and take a peek at
the quasar PKS 0637-752, a nice point source that we can focus up on.
Once everything's in focus and aligned, we'll take our official first
light image of the supernova remnant Cas A.  With the combined spatial
and spectral resolution of the ACIS imager, we can get information
on the physical conditions and chemical composition in different
parts of the supernova remnant, and compare detailed features with
those seen in optical and radio images.

Fortunately, my first duty scientist shift isn't till three
days after launch, so I get to go down and watch.
I'll be in the Cape Canaveral area for a few days starting Jul 18.
Any readers in that area who'd like to meet up, send me email or
meet me around 5:30pm Jul 19 in the lobby of the Cocoa Beach Hilton.

Recent Launches
---------------

Krunichev's Proton-K launch vehicle suffered its first failure in six
years on Jul 5 (there have been upper stage failures since then, but not
failures of the Proton itself). The Proton was launched from Baykonur at
1332 UTC. At 4min 37 seconds into flight, one of the four second stage
engines failed catastrophically, and the second stage exploded. The
remainder of the vehicle survived the explosion but broke up about 45
seconds later. Debris landed near Karaganda. The Proton second
stage has four KB Khivavtomatiki RD-0210 engines, burning unsymmetrical
dimethyl hydrazine (UDMH) and nitrogen tetroxide.

This Proton-K carried a Russian Defense Ministry comsat. Gran' No.
45 was built by NPO Prikladnoi Mekhaniki and would have been named
Raduga if it had reached orbit (info from Aleksandr Zheleznyakov). The
Gran' series are the oldest Russian geostationary comsats, first
launched in 1975. Instead of the usual Energiya Blok-DM class stage,
this mission carried the Krunichev Briz-M upper stage on its first test
flight. T

AP reports the payload as a 'Raduga-1'. This is incorrect - the
Raduga-1 (Globus) series are different from the Raduga (Gran')
satellites.

A Molniya-3 comsat was launched from Plesetsk on Jul 8. The launch was
from one of the 3 active R-7 class pads at Plesetsk (LC16/pad 2,
LC43/pad 3, LC43/pad 4) and used the 8K78M launch vehicle, consisting of
the 11S59 core packet, the 11S510 Blok I third stage, and the Blok-ML
upper stage. The Blok ML and the payload were placed in a 62.8 degree
low parking orbit and then the ML fired to deliver the payload to a
12-hour operational orbit. The payload is the 52nd Molniya-3 to be
launched and is probably Molniya-3 11F637 No. 63, although the
satellites are not launched in production order. The Molniya-3 is built
by NPO PM of Zheleznogorsk, and provides communications and TV relay for
Russian military and civil agencies.

Four Loral/Alenia Globalstar satellites were launched on Jul 10 by a
Boeing Delta 7420-10. Globalstar satellites M032, M030 (on the upper
dispenser tier), M035 and M051 (on the lower dispenser tier) were placed
in orbit after the Delta stage 2's second burn. 28 Globalstar satellites
have now reached orbit.

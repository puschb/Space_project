Editorial
--------

I don't often editorialize like this, but I'll make an exception. Even
with the restoration of funding for the crucial SIRTF mission on Friday,
the proposed NASA budget cuts are a devastating blow to the US space
science program and to the morale of all of us who work on NASA
programs. The Discovery and Explorer programs are badly hit, US
participation in Solar B and FIRST/Planck would be cut,  and the GLAST
gamma ray telescope might face the axe. NASA's budget in real terms has
been cut repeatedly in recent years. The new cuts to space science are
especially harsh, given the major successful reforms of the NASA space
science program. We've  worked hard over the past decade to bring the US
public great results from our studies of the universe while cutting back
budgets. I frequently give talks to the general public and have been
aware of a growing enthusiasm for, interest in, and support for space
science over the past few years. I hope the US public will become aware
of the proposed cuts and persuade Congress to relent further.

STS-93/Chandra
---------------

Chandra continues to operate well in transfer orbit. Both the ACIS and
HRC cameras have survived launch and will be checked out over the next
few weeks. The IPS-3 burn to raise apogee to 140000 km  was carried out
at 2232 UTC on Jul 31. DSN tracking indicates the orbit is now 3482 x
139384 km x 28.5 deg. A further IPS-4 burn on Aug 4 raised perigee to 
around 5700 km, and another perigee raise burn is planned for Aug 7.

The Integral Propulsion System on Chandra uses four TR-308 bipropellant
thrusters for orbit changes. The thrusters use N2O4 (nitrogen tetroxide)
oxidizer and N2H4 (hydrazine) fuel. They have a thrust of 472N and a
specific impulse of 322.3s; the TR-308 is an upgrade of the TR-306 that
was used on three Lockheed Martin Series 5000 satellites. The same fuel
tanks also feed Marquardt 89N monopropellant hydrazine RCS thrusters. In
addition to the IPS, the MUPS (Momentum Unloading Propulsion System)
uses 0.9N hydrazine thrusters to unload momentum from the gyro systems
used to point Chandra. (Thanks to the TRW propulsion experts for the
info). Thrusters LAE-1 and LAE-3 were used for the first three burns;
LAE-2 and LAE-4 were used for IPS-4 and will be used for the remaining
burns.

Columbia landed at 0320 UTC on Jul 28 on runway 33 at KSC. Post flight
inspection confirms the presence of holes in the  cooling lines on the
nozzle of SSME 2019 (engine 3) which caused a hydrogen leak. A loose
repair pin in the engine broke free and may have caused the  failure.
Although the leak was small, this combined with the electrical short
makes two semi-serious failures in the main propulsion system during
ascent, and I can't remember a launch since 51-L when we've had that. 
Fortunately the two failures didn't add together, but it seems like we
lost enough redundancy to make me nervous.

Recent Launches
---------------

Deep Space 1 made a flyby of minor planet (9969) Braille at 0446 UTC on
Jul 29. Flyby distance was less than 25 km and possibly as little as 15
km. DS 1 failed to point its camera to image the target at closest
approach, but the navigation system was successful in bringing the
vehicle close to the asteroid, and longer range IR imaging was
successful. The NSTAR ion engine continues to operate well.

Lunar Prospector impacted the lunar surface at 0952 UTC on 1999 Jul 31.
Impact site was 42.1E, 87.7S near the lunar south pole. The orbit was
raised to a 230 km apogee before the deorbit burn over the lunar farside
at 0919 UTC.

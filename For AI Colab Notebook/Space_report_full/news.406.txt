Chandra
---------------

The IPS-5 burn was carried out on Aug 7. We are now in our final orbit
and the spacecraft is working well. In fact, a lot of the experts are
heading back to the left coast and the flight controllers now seem
pretty bored with the whole thing... thanks TRW for building us a
nice bird.

Here  are some extracts from the latest press release: "Spontaneous
cheers and applause erupted from managers and controllers clustered
around consoles at NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory Operations Control
Center in Cambridge, Mass., today  [Aug 12] as data from the observatory
confirmed that its sunshade door is open. "

"Over the next week or two, the control team will do an initial
calibration and early focusing of the telescope and take the first
images with the observatory. NASA plans to unveil the first significant
image and report on the observatory's early status at a news media
briefing later this month. "

"Today's activities culminated a busy week for the observatory control
team during which they replaced pre-launch software aboard Chandra's
computers with software that will be used during the operational part of
the mission; opened the aft contamination cover which protected
Chandra's sensitive mirrors from contamination prior-to and during
launch; began characterizing the reflectivity of the mirrors (using
special x-ray sources constructed by Marshall and mounted to the inside
of the sunshade door); and continued activation and checkout of the
telescope's two primary science instruments."

NASA has announced that the first light images, including one of
supernova remnant Cas A, will be released at a press conference on
Thursday Aug 26. 

Shuttle and Mir
---------------

The Mir spacewalk on Jul 23 started at 1106 UTC and lasted 6h 7min.
The spacewalk on Jul 28 started at 0937 UTC and lasted 5h 22min.
During the second spacewalk, Afanas'ev and Avdeev erected an
experimental 6-meter antenna. At the end of the experiment the
antenna was jettisoned.

The next Shuttle mission is being delayed because of electrical
wiring problems discovered on Columbia, which caused the short
during the STS-93 launch. It's not clear yet whether the STS-99
radar mapper or the STS-103 Hubble repair will fly first.

Recent Launches
---------------

Arianespace is back in the launch business, with Indonesia's Telkom 1
placed in geostationary transfer orbit on Aug 12. Launches had been
delayed because of problems with comsat manufacturing. The Ariane 42P
launch vehicle delivered its LOX/LH2 H-10-3 third stage and the Telkom 1
payload to a 221 x 35687 km x 7.0 deg GTO 21 min after launch. Telkom 1
is an A2100 series satellite build by Lockheed Martin/Sunnyvale. The
owner is PT Telkomunikasi of Indonesia. Telkom 1 is a successor to the
Palapa  series of satellites, the first of which was launched in 1976.
Mass of Telkom 1 is 2763 kg launch, 1700 kg in GEO; dry mass not
available.

Four more Globalstar comsats were launched on Aug 17 by a Boeing
Delta 2 rocket.


The Russian Strategic Rocket Forces launched a Soyuz-U rocket from
Plesetsk on Aug 18, placing a Yantar'-class spy satellite in orbit for
the Russian Defense Ministry. The satellite is in a 166 x 342 km x 67.1
deg orbit, and  is one of the low-perigee, high resolution series that
followed on from the Kobal't satellites launched since 1981.

Cassini flew past Earth at a distance of 1171 km at 0328 UTC Aug 18.
Before the swingby, Cassini was in an orbit passing near Venus, with a
perihelion of 0.7 AU, and stretching out the the middle of the asteroid
belt at 2.6 AU. Picking up speed from the Earth encounter, the probe's
perihelion has slightly increased to 0.86 AU but its aphelion is now 7.2
AU, between Jupiter and Saturn.

US Air Force Space Command launched two Minuteman 3 missiles from
Vandenberg to Kwajalein on Aug 20. The three stage missiles probably
reached an apogee of 1500 km or so. Flight GT170-1GM was launched from
silo LF-10 at 0845 UTC, and flight GT171GM was launched from LF-09 at
1127 UTC. These were the first Minuteman test flights since February.


Space History
-------------

For the record,  the results on launch pad locations from my trip
to KSC. These positions have low absolute accuracy (100m) but good relative
accuracy. I've never been able to distinguish LC1 to LC4 on maps, so I wanted
to establish more clearly where they were.
 LC1 80 32.23W 28 27.91N
 LC2 80 32.21W 28 27.93N
 LC3 80 32.17W 28 27.95N
 LC4 80 32.16W 28 27.99N
 LC5 80 34.42W 28 26.36N
 LC6 80 34.35W 28 26.42N
 LC26A 80 34.26W 28 26.67N
 LC26B 80 34.30W 28 26.62N

I'd still like to get pads LC9/10/31/32 recorded,  also not well located
on maps. These positions are WGS-84 as realized by cheapo $100 GPS set.
Pad 3 was the site of the first launch from Cape Canaveral almost 50
years ago. It was also the site of X-17 launches, used to develop
Polaris technology. Pad 4 was used for Redstone launches from 1953 to
1955. Pads 1 and 2 were used for tests of the Snark cruise missile. Pads
5,6, 26A, 26B were used for launches of Redstone and Jupiter class
rockets, including the Explorer satellites and the Mercury-Redstone.
There's been some discussion about which pad is 5 and which is 6, so
if anyone can confirm that LC5 is the southern one, further from the
Space Museum, I'd appreciate it.

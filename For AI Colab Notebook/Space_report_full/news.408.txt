The Shuttle schedule's still on hold pending repairs to the Orbiters.
Columbia was flown to Palmdale, California for refurbishment on Sep 24-25.
It will remain there until mid-2000. The next mission will probably
be STS-103/Discovery, the HST servicing mission, currently expected
in late November.

Recent Launches
---------------

Mars Climate Orbiter began its Mars Orbit Insertion burn on Sep 23 at
0850UTC, but a navigation error meant that the closest approach to  the
surface of Mars was only 57 km, half the intended height. No signal was
received after MCO went behind the planet, and it is feared that the
spacecraft burnt up during the unintentional aerocapture maneuver.
Closest approach to the  planet was probably around 0900 UTC. I don't
know the latitude and longitude of closest approach, or the likely
impact site - if anyone has calculated these please pass the info on to
me. It's possible that MCO survived the aeropass and is in orbit around
Mars but defunct, with its antenna broken off; or that the friction took
so much energy from MCO that its debris impacted on Mars some way down
track from the entry point. Questions for the class: do we know the
current state of the Martian atmosphere at the entry point well enough
to model what happened to MCO? My immediate prejudice based on behaviour
of elliptical orbit low perigee Earth satellites is that the main part
of the MCO bus, even if damaged, should have survived the first pass and
remained in orbit, but probably in an orbit that would impact on the
next rev: about 50 km perigee, unknown apogee, and 90 degrees
inclination.  The location of the succeeding impact point depends
critically on that unknown apogee, which determines the orbital period
and therefore how much Mars rotated before the impact. I'm not competent
to do the relevant calculations, so we'll have to wait for more
definitive statements from JPL.

Foton 12 (spacecraft 34KS No. 12) was launched on Sep 9. The Foton
satellites, built by TsSKB Progress of Samara, Russia, are based on the
Zenit spy satellite bus, related to the old Vostok spaceship.  The
spacecraft consists of a spherical descent module, a service module with
solid-propellant deorbit motor, and a separable battery pack. Foton
missions carry materials processing experiments and life sciences
experiments. This flight carried a number of European experiments. The
11A511U (Soyuz-U) launch vehicle took off from Plesetsk at 1800 UTC on
Sep 9 and entered a 216 x 379 km x 62.8 deg orbit 9 minutes later. After
two weeks of microgravity, the battery pack and a small adapter
separated, with two retrorocket covers also being ejected into a higher
323 x 492 km orbit. The retrorocket fired and separated, with the
spacecraft's descent module landing in Russia at 52 28N 53 50E at
between 0918 UTC and 0929 UTC (reports differ) on Sep 24.

Four more Globalstar satellites were launched on Sep 22. A Starsem
Soyuz/Ikar rocket placed the four satellites in orbit. The 11A511U
Soyuz-U took off from area 1 at 5 GIK (Baykonur). The four strapons
separated 2 min after launch, and at 4 min after launch the Blok-A
central core (nominally stage 2) separated. The Blok I third stage 
fired until 9 min after launch, entering a 235 x 906 km x 51.9 deg
transfer orbit and separating from the Ikar upper stage and dispenser.
At apogee Ikar burned to deploy the four satellites (M033, M050, M055,
M058) in a 900 x 960 km x 51.9 deg parking orbit. Ikar later made a
deorbit burn and reentered on Sep 24. Globalstar satellite numbers which
have not yet been launched are M029, M031, M034, M039, M056, and M057. 
The Globalstar satellites use the Space Systems/Loral LS-400 bus,
built by SS-L/Palo Alto and Alenia/Roma. Globalstar will provide
handheld telephone service starting in the next few months.

Lockheed Martin launched an Atlas 2AS vehicle on Sep 23 carrying the
Echostar 5 satellite. The Centaur second stage delivered Echostar 5 to a
supersynchronous transfer orbit of 131 x 45526 km x 26.6 deg. This was
the first flight to use RL-10 engines since the Delta 3 failure in May.
Echostar 5 is a Ku-band satellite supplementing the Dish Network,
built by Space Systems/Loral using the FS-1300 bus.

The Lockheed Martin Athena has also returned to flight. Athena-2 flight
LM-007 took off from Space Launch Complex 6 at Vandenberg AFB on Sep 24
with Space Imaging Inc's Ikonos commercial imaging satellite. Ikonos
flight satellite number 2 has apparently been named simply 'Ikonos' on
orbit (satellite number 1 fell in the Pacific in a launch failure). If
the launch profile was similar to that planned for the first Ikonos
launch, the Orbus 21 third stage placed Ikonos and the OAM fourth stage
on a suborbital trajectory. The first OAM burn would then place the
stack in a 220 x 689 km x 98.2 deg transfer orbit 10 min after launch.
51 min after launch, the OAM fired again at apogee for 6 minutes,
placing Ikonos in a 678 x 682 km x 98.1 deg  sun-synchronous orbit with
a 10:30am descending node. It then separated from Ikonos and fired again
to lower its orbit for disposal. Space Command is tracking it in a 207 x
431 km x 98.2 deg orbit, but also cataloged a third object in a 137 x
630 km x 97.7 deg orbit. The orbit of this third object is very close to
the quoted post-disposal orbit for the OAM intended for the Ikonos 1
launch, so I'm wondering if this might actually be the OAM. The lower
inclination is odd if it's a piece that came off during the transfer
orbit, although I suppose it might be the Orbus 21 stage if that overperformed
and just reached orbit.

Ikonos spacecraft 2 carries a 1-meter resolution black-and-white camera and
a 4-meter resolution color camera, with a 13 km swath width. The spacecraft 
was built by Lockheed Martin/Sunnyvale using the LM900 bus and carries
6 MR-103G 0.1N thrusters for attitude control. Mass is 726 kg.

Arianespace launched an Ariane 44LP with the Telstar 7 satellite
into supersynchronous transfer orbit of 129 x 59944 km x 7.0 deg
on Sep 25 (this orbit is from the Space Command data and the perigee
seems a bit low; the third stage is tracked in a 175 x 64273 km
orbit). It's unusual for an Ariane launch to use the high-apogee transfer
orbit technique. Telstar 7 is a Space Systems/Loral FS-1300 satellite owned
by Loral Skynet. It has 24 C-band and 24 Ku-band transponders and
has a dry mass of 1537 kg (3790 kg fuelled). Telstar 7 will provide
communications for North America from 129 deg E.
This was a busy week for Space Systems/Loral, with 4 Globalstar and
two FS-1300 satellites orbited.

The Yamal 101 satellite was in a 1442.06 35504 x 36302 km x 0.0 deg
geosynchronous drift orbit ayt 63.1E drifting 1.5 deg W per day on Sep
24. The Yamal 102 satellite was in a 1438.99 min, 35581 x 36104 km x 0.0
deg orbit over 70E drifting 0.7 deg W per day on Sep 22. The early
orbital data showing the Yamals in transfer orbit was erroneous; Space
Command is not yet tracking the SOZ ullage motors.

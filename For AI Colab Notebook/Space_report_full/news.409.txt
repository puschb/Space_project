Recent Launches
---------------

Lockheed Martin Intersputnik's LMI-1 satellite was launched on Sep 26 by
International Launch Services on a Krunichev Proton with an Energiya
Blok DM3 upper stage. LMI-1 will provide communications services to 
Eastern Europe and Central Asia. LMI 1 is currently in a geostationary
drift orbit.

Analysis of the quoted velocites at separation for the various Athena 2
stages suggests that the object now being cataloged as 1999-51C is the
Orbus 21 ESBM stage, and 1999-51B is the OAM stage. Athena sources
confirm this (Space Command originally incorrectly cataloged the old 51B
- the object now called 51C - as the OAM, but seem to have corrected
things now). My sources also inform me that although the Lewis launch
vehicle in 1997 had "LM-1" incorrectly painted on the side, it is really
tail number "LM-2". I'll update the launch logs soon.    

Russia launched another Zenit-class recoverable satellite from Plesetsk
on Sep 28 into a 220 x 231 km x 82.3 deg orbit. The satellite is probably
a Resurs F-1M remote sensing satellite. This is the second Resurs F-1M
flight; the first was in Nov 1997, following on from the
Resurs F-1 flights which ended in 1993.

The third GPS Block 2R satellite was launched on Oct 7. The spacecraft
is Block IIR SV06, or SVN 46 in the overall production numbering scheme.
This satellite replaced SVN 50, which was soaked during a storm at
pad 17 earlier this year and has been returned to the factory for
repairs.

The Mars Climate Orbiter fiasco was reportedly due to confusion between
metric and imperial units in a software interface between Lockheed
Martin/Denver and the JPL nav team coupled with the use of some new
software. After all these years on this side of  the pond I still find
it hard to deal with the fact that US engineers still use imperial
units! Thruster impulse data should have been in Ns, but used lbf-s
instead, and noone caught the error. It may never be clear whether
MCO impacted Mars or remained in solar orbit, although I feel
the former is more likely.

A Minuteman 2 missile with an MSLS reentry section was launched from
silo LF03 at Vandenberg on Oct 3 at 0201 UTC. The IFT-3 flight used the
MSLS vehicle as a target for an EKV interceptor launched from Kwajalein.
The interceptor launch vehicle is the two-stage PLV, made up of a
Minuteman 2 second and third stage. Intercept was reported to be
successful.

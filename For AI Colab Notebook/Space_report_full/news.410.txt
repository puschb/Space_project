Recent Launches
---------------


Boeing Sea Launch made its second successful Zenit-3SL flight from
the Odyssey launch platform in the Pacific Ocean at 154W 0N. This
was the first flight to carry a commercial payload, the Hughes
DirecTV 1R. The HS-601 satellite used its R-4D apogee engine to
enter geostationary orbit and is now in a 35742 x 35830 km x 0.0 deg
orbit over 81.6W.

China launched two Brazilian satellites, CBERS 1 and SACI 1 on Oct 14.
Zi Yuan 1 (CBERS 1) is the China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite. I
believe CBERS 1 was actually built by CAST/Beijing, with INPE/Brasil
taking the lead for CBERS 2. Mass is 1450 kg. The satellite is in a 732
x 745 km x 98.6 deg sun-synchronous orbit and is controlled from both
Chinese and Brazilian ground stations. This was the second launch
of the Shanghai group's CZ-4B rocket, which has an improved third
stage and larger fairing compared to the earlier CZ-4A.

SACI-1 is INPE's 60 kg experimental scientific satellite. It carries a
magnetometer, particle detectors and an atmospheric experiment. INPE
reportedly lost contact with the satellite in mid-October and its
current status is unknown.

Four more Globalstar satellites were launched on Oct 18. The Soyuz-U
rocket placed the Ikar stage and the dispenser with satellites in
elliptical transfer orbit. Ikar made a burn at apogee and the satellites
were released; a second Ikar burn, with the dispenser still attached,
was meant to deorbit the stage a day later, but Space Command data
showed it in orbit on Oct 20. Thanks to Aleksandr Zheleznyakov for the
correct launch time. Globalstar has now begun limited service with
its satellite telephone system.

Loral Orion's Orion 2 satellite was launched on Oct 19 by Ariane 44LP.
Arianespace's fourth launch in a little over two months placed the
FS-1300 class comsat in supersynchronous transfer orbit with a 60000 km
apogee. The Orion satellites are used for international communications
and complement the Telstar domestic series operated by Loral Skynet.

The Resurs F-1M satellite was recovered on Oct 22 after completing
its 3-week remote sensing mission.

The Russian Ekspress-A1 communications satellite was launched on Oct 27
but the Proton-K launch vehicle failed early in flight, during second
stage burn. This is the second failure of the 8K82K Proton-K  this year.

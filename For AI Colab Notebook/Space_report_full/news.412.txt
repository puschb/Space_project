Recent Launches
---------------

China launched its Shenzhou spaceship on Nov 19 on a test flight without
astronauts aboard. Further test flights are expected before its first
piloted flight. Shenzhou ("Divine Ship") was launched by the new CZ-2F
vehicle, an improved version of the CZ-2E, from a new pad at China's
oldest space launch site, Jiuquan in the Gobi desert. Shenzhou's reentry
vehicle was recovered after a 21 hour flight at 1941 UTC on Nov 20 in
Inner Mongolia. Shenzhou's orbit was 197 x 323 km x 42.6 deg. Two
debris objects were tracked after the launch, possibly launch adapters
or fairings. 

The spacecraft's design is analogous to the 7K Soyuz, with a propulsion
module, a descent module and an orbital module. The descent module
appears to be identical to the Soyuz-TM descent module and reports
indicate that actual Soyuz flight hardware purchased from Russia may
have been used, albeit with Chinese developed avionics. The remainder of
the spacecraft is a fully Chinese design. Details of the propulsion
module are not available. The orbital module is cylindrical and somewhat
similar in shape and appearance to the US Unity Node on the Space
Station.

During Nov 21 the orbital module separated, and then at around 1850 UTC
the propulsion module fired its engine for the deorbit burn, separating
from the descent module and burning up in the atmosphere. The orbital
module was left in a 205 x 332 km orbit.

Starsem launched a Soyuz-U/Ikar from Baykonur on Nov 22 with four
more Globalstar satellites. This was the first launch from Baykonur
since the recent Proton failure. The Loral Globalstar satellites
were deployed in the usual 900 x 942 km x 52.0 deg parking orbit.
The Ikar stage ignited again to deorbit itself on Nov 23.
The Blok I third stage is in a 230 x 876 km x 52.0 deg orbit.

Lockheed Martin/International Launch Services launched a Lockheed
Martin Astronautics Atlas 2A, serial AC-136, from Cape Canaveral on Nov 23.
The Centaur entered low circular parking orbit on its first burn, and
then reignited to place the UHF F/O F10 satellite in subsynchronous
transfer orbit. On Nov 28 the satellite was in a 26527 x 36665 km x 7.2
deg orbit after the first burns of its R-4D liquid apogee engine.

UHF Followon F10 is a Hughes HS-601 satellite with UHF and EHF
communications payloads and the Global Broadcast Service TV payload,
and will provide communications services for the US Navy.

Galileo made a 300 km flyby of Io on Nov 26 at 0400 UTC. Galileo is
probably now in a 407000 x 6200000 km x 1.3 deg orbit around Jupiter,
although the orbital element data on the Galileo web site has not been
updated for the post-Europa-mission phase.

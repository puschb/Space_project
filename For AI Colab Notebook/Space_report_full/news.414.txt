The European Space Agency's XMM satellite is in orbit. The fourth Ariane
5 launch (and the first commercial flight) took off on schedule from
Kourou on Dec 10 at 1432 UTC. The initial version of the Ariane 5 EPS
upper stage can only make a single burn, so mission 504 flew an unusual
direct ascent trajectory to its highly elliptical orbit. The EPC main
stage separated at 1442 UTC in a high energy suborbital trajectory with
a  velocity of around 7.8 km/s, and impact near the Galapagos Islands (I
don't know what the apogee was). The EPS upper stage ignited and made a
long 16 minute burn to accelerate the vehicle to over 9 km/s and 1880 km
altitude. XMM separated from the EPS upper stage at 1501 UTC, and is in
an 838 x 112473 km x 40.0 deg transfer orbit, very close to the planned
one. The first apogee burn will be on Dec 11.  Space Command have
cataloged the spacecraft as  1999-66A (although the listing calls it
MMX!)

This mission, Ariane 504 or flight V119, was the second fully successful
flight for Ariane 5, which is a completely new launch vehicle (Ariane 4
is basically an upgraded version of Ariane 1, 2 and 3). The first Ariane
5 flight ended in disaster, with the Cluster science payload ending up
in the mangrove swamp next to the launch pad. The second flight had a
relatively minor roll problem which left the experimental payload in an
orbit which was thousands of kilometers lower than planned. The third
flight placed the ARD capsule on its planned suborbital trajectory and
put a dummy satellite in geostationary transfer orbit. The first two
test missions were carried out under the auspices of  the European Space
Agency (ESA); Ariane 503 was owned and launched by the commercial
Arianespace launch provider, but counted as a test mission, while XMM is
Arianespace's first commercial contract to fly on Ariane 5, albeit with
ESA as the customer. The success of flight V119 will bolster confidence
that the early problems with the vehicle are behind it, and 2000 should
see a ramp up of commercial geostationary comsat launches on Ariane 5.

The Ariane 5 vehicle consists of two EAP (Etage d'Acceleration a Poudre)
solid boosters, the EPC (Etage Principal Cryogenique) main stage which
features the LH2/LOX high energy 1145 kN Snecma Vulcain engine, and the
EPS (Etage a Propergols Stockables) upper stage with the 29 kN Aestus
engine burning hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide. The large nose fairing
covers EPS and the payload. The only other launch vehicles with a
liquid hydrogen first stage are the Shuttle and Japan's H-2.

XMM (X-ray Multi-Mirror Mission), built by DaimlerChrysler Dornier
Satellitensystem, is a large X-ray  observatory which will complement
NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory. XMM has larger collecting area but
poorer spatial resolution, so it will be better at getting detailed
spectra of bright and moderately faint X-ray sources, while Chandra will
be better at detecting the very faintest X-ray sources and at
distinguishing spectral details in different parts of a source (for
instance, separating a pulsar from a supernova remnant or a quasar from
a cluster of galaxies). The claim on the ESA web site that XMM "will see
infinitely more than any previous X-ray satellite" 
(http://www.estec.esa.nl/spdwww/xmm/factsheet.html) is an embarrassingly
ridiculous misstatement, but I certainly expect XMM to make many
important discoveries and be one of the most important space science
missions of the coming decade.

XMM has three similar X-ray telescopes. One of the telescopes images
directly onto the EPIC-pn CCD camera; the other two have Reflection
Grating Spectrometers (RGS) which split the light, sending images
to the EPIC-MOS cameras and dispersed spectra to the RFC-MOS cameras.
XMM also carries an 0.30-meter aperture optical/ultraviolet telescope,
the Optical Monitor, which will allow simultaneous measurements
of the optical and ultraviolet light from the source being studied
with the X-ray telescopes.

XMM's hydrazine propulsion system has eight 22N thrusters which will be
used to raise the perigee to around 7000 km. Dry mass of XMM is 3234 kg,
and it carries 530 kg of hydrazine fuel at launch. Control of the XMM
spacecraft will be from ESOC/Darmstadt, while the instruments will be
controlled from the VILSPA/Madrid station. The instruments will not be
fully activated until early next year, when XMM is in its final orbit
and VILSPA is ready for operation, so it will be a while before we know
whether the telescope is working correctly. The Leicester University
X-ray group will support the scientific analysis of data from XMM.
There's a strong heritage of world-class X-ray astronomy in Europe, with
the British groups at Leicester and Mullard Space Science Lab flying
early sounding rockets and the Ariel 5 satellite in the 1970s and the
Birmingham group (TTM/Kvant), the Utrecht group and the ESA team at
ESTEC in Holland, the German groups at MPE/Garching (ROSAT) and now
AIP/Potsdam, and a number of institutes (Milano, Bologna, Palermo, Roma)
in Italy (BeppoSAX), as well as a bunch of places that don't do hardware
but are very strong in data analysis and theory, like Andy Fabian's team
in Cambridge. Oh, and let's not forget the Danes and Toulouse and
Southampton and  ... I'm sure whoever else I left out will remind me in
no uncertain terms. The point is that while in many fields of space
exploration Europe plays second rank to the US, in X-ray astronomy it's
- in my opinion - an equal partner. 


Brazil ran into more bad luck on Dec 11 when the second launch of its
VLS-1 rocket met a similar fate to the first one. Three minutes after
launch the second stage failed to ignite and the vehicle went off
course. It was destroyed by range safety command. On the previous
mission, the strapons on the first stage failed, so at least on this
flight the Brazilian team were able to test the first stage
successfully. VLS-1 mission V02 carried a research satellite, SACI-2.

A USAF weather satellite in the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program
(DMSP)  was launched from Vandenberg on Dec 12. The first Block 5D-3
model, satellite F-15 was placed in a suborbital trajectory by a
two-stage Titan 23G, a refurbished Titan II ICBM. The Star 37S kick
motor on the satellite fired  13 min after launch for orbit insertion.
DMSP 5D F-15 is now in an 837 x 851 km x 98.9 deg orbit. The spacecraft,
built by Lockheed Martin/Valley Forge, is similar in design to the
civilian NOAA weather satellites.

The Orbcomm Pegasus launch took off from Runway 22 at Wallops at 1756
UTC on Dec 3, and drop was at 1853 UTC. Thanks to Justin Ray of
www.spaceflightnow.com (an excellent site) for the info; apparently the
new Orbcomm satellites are slightly more massive that the earlier ones -
probably around 45 kg.

The Oldest Spacecraft - Errata
-------------------------------

 Pioneer 11 shouldn't have been in the list, it's been silent since
1995, and I omitted Nozomi which should have been there. I am informed
TVSAT 2 was switched off on 1999 Oct 5, and that NOAA 10 (and possibly
NOAA 9) is still alive. Thanks to all those who caught the errors. 

The surviving Marisat is actually Marisat 102, launched Oct 1976, and is
qowned by Comsat General Corp, not INMARSAT (at one time INMARSAT used to
lease the C and L band capacity). It is the oldest commercial satellite
still in operation, and is a Hughes HS-356  (basically the same design
as the HS-333 used for Anik A and Westar).
  
The IMP 8 and LES-9 satellites are confirmed to be still working, and
there is a report that Navy Navigation Satellite O-2 (sometimes
incorrectly referred to as Transit 5B-5), which was launched in 1964,
may still be transmitting. A number of spacecraft, like Giotto, are
believed to be still workable but are currently dormant.

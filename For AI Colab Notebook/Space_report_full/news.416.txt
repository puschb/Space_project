Editorial
---------

To avoid Y2K rollover problems, JSR is looking back instead of forward
and has switched to the calendar of the Roman Republic. Happy New Year
to all my readers (and note that the Julian new year is not till Jan 14
Gregorian - yet another excuse for a party!) - I hope the 2753rd year
since the founding of Rome and final year of this Common Era millenium
will be successful for you all.

Shuttle
-------

Discovery grappled the Hubble Space Telescope with the robot arm at 0034
UTC on Dec 22, in a 591 x 610 km x 28.5 deg. The first EVA on Dec 22-23,
by Smith and  Grunsfeld, was successful in replacing the six gyroscopes.
On EVA-2, by Foale and Nicollier, the 486 computer was installed
(replacing a 286/386) and the Fine Guidance Sensor (FGS-2) was replaced.
EVA-3 was by Smith and Grunsfeld, and completed part of the new
insulation installation. HST was released on Dec 25 at 2303 UTC. The
deorbit burn at 2248 UTC on Dec 27 placed the orbiter in a 50 x 616 km
descent orbit, and Discovery landed on runway 33 at Kennedy Space Center
at 0001 UTC on Dec 28.

In the spacewalks, the axial hatch on the external airlock was used.
The hatch was opened before the astronauts went on battery power (I
think this is a recent practice; can someone confirm this?)
     
For EVA-3, Grunsfeld's EMU suit had a problem, so he used the suit worn
by Foale on EVA-2 instead. I believe that a total of 3 EMUs were carried
on the flight; serial numbers for the EMUs and PLSSs will eventually
become available in the operational data book summaries, and hopefully
it will be clear which one was used on which EVA (hi, JBC!). However, the
new suit also had a problem at the end of the spacewalk, when it refused
to switch to orbiter power.

I track three different definitions of spacewalk time, none of which are
quite the same as NASA's. The Hatch open/close time is essentially the
definition used by Russia, although I'm not sure whether to use the main
hatch or the thermal cover (values in parentheses) as the 'hatch' in
question. The times below are approximate.

Spacewalks:
       Depress (1psi) Depress   Hatch open/close   Ingress/Egress   NASA
       start/UTC      duration  duration           duration         duration
EVA-1  Dec 22 1838?   8:32       8:10  (7:57)     7:50              8:15
EVA-2  Dec 23 1845?   8:31       8:07  (7:52)     7:50              8:10
EVA-3  Dec 24 1910?   8:15       7:52  (7:35)     7:28              8:08

The next Shuttle launch is the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (STS-99),
using orbiter Endeavour. Discovery is now in one of the bays of
the Orbiter Processing Facility (I don't know which one) and will fly
again next summer.

Recent Launches
---------------

Korea's KOMPSAT (Korean Multipurpose Satellite) was launched on Dec 21
by an Orbital Sciences Taurus from Vandenberg. It carries an ocean color
sensor developed by TRW and particle detectors. KOMPSAT was built by the
Korean Aerospace Research Institute (KARI) based on a test model built
by TRW; it uses the TRW STEP Lightsat bus and has a mass of around 500
kg, with 73 kg of hydrazine fuel. The NASA ACRIMSAT satellite was
launched on the same rocket; ACRIMSAT, managed by JPL, will measure the
integrated solar energy output from 0.2 to 2 microns.  ACRIMSAT was
built by Orbital Sciences. The satellites are in a 690 x 722 km x 98.3
deg orbit.

The Taurus used a Castor 120 solid motor first stage (stage zero in
Orbital's nomenclature) and three Pegasus derived upper stages. Attached
to the Taurus final stage is a Celestis burial canister containing
cremated human remains. This is Celestis' third mission - I think; some
of my sources suggest a Celestis package flew on the May 1999 Pegasus,
but I believe that is not correct.

Arianespace launched an Ariane 44L from Kourou on Dec 22.  Aboard was
Hughes' Galaxy 11, the first HS-702 satellite.  Galaxy 11 will be the
first satellite to use ion propulsion to go from geostationary transfer
orbit to circular geostationary orbit, using its 25-cm XIPS ion engine. 
It also carries a bipropellant engine of some kind. Some HS-601
satellites used the smaller 13-cm XIPS for north-south stationkeeping.
Galaxy 11 was initially in a 278 x 38900 km x 5.4 deg transfer orbit.
The first XIPS burn phase seems to have gone well, as on Dec 28 it was
tracked in a 5516 x 38924 km x 1.4 deg orbit. Launch mass was 4484 kg;
Hughes refuse to reveal the true (dry) mass of their satellites. 

I am informed that the failed Brazilian SACI-2 satellite launch time was
1640 local time, which allegedly translates to 1940 UTC. Earlier wire
reports gave 1830 UTC.

Kosmos-2367, launched Dec 26, is a US-P passive electronic intelligence
satellite. The US-P satellites, built by KB Arsenal of Sankt-Peterburg,
are cylindrical with two large solar arrays and a low thrust propulsion
system which keeps the satellite in a precise orbit. The two-stage 11K69
Tsiklon-2 launch vehicle (derived from the R-36 ICBM) placed the US-P
satellite in a low 147 x 442 km orbit at 65 degree inclination. The
US-P's propulsion module fired to circularize the orbit at apogee as 404
x 417 km x 65.0 deg. The last US-P satellite ended operations in
November and reentered earlier this month. US-P is a Russian Navy system
used to detect radio and electronic transmissions from ships. There's an
excellent and very detailed history of the US-P program by Asif Siddiqi
in the Nov/Dec issue of the Journal of the British Interplanetary
Society.

Kosmos-2368 was launched on Dec 28. It is an Oko-class early warning
satellite. The Oko satellites are built by the Lavochkin company and
carry a large telescope to monitor missile launches. The 8K78M
(Molniya-M) launch vehicle placed the payload and fourth stage in a low
229 x 523 km x 62.8 deg orbit; the fourth stage (Blok-2BL) fired over
South America on the first orbit and delivered the payload to a 12-hour
551 x 39138 km x 62.8 deg elliptical orbit.

Launch times for Kosmos-2367 and Kosmos-2368 have been estimated from
their orbital ground tracks.

According to a so far unconfirmed report on the FPSPACE list, the
RVSN-40 satellite and its Rokot launch vehicle were destroyed in an
accident at Plesetsk on Dec 24. RVSN-40 was a small satellite to test
spaceborne GLONASS (Russian GPS) receivers and new minisat systems. The
Rokot launch vehicle, based on the Krunichev UR-100NUTTKh missile with a
14S12 Briz-K upper stage, would have made its second orbital flight.
According to the story, the Rokot was undergoing tests when its stage
separation systems all fired, sending the upper stage and payload flying
out of the silo.

Now this is a tricky question for a pedant like me. We consider an
orbital launch attempt to occur if the launch vehicle leaves the pad.
So, if the Shuttle ignites and then shuts down its main engines at T-2s
in an RSLS abort, that's not a launch. But if a rocket leaves the pad by
a few centimeters and then falls back down, it counts and I catalog it
as a failed launch. The difference there is essentially that you don't
get to try again. On the other hand, if a rocket explodes on the pad
before launch, that's a different category. But what about this: it's an
UNINTENTIONAL launch! Admittedly, with an apogee of only a few meters
and without rocket propulsion. So, although I could make an argument to
count this one as an orbital launch failure on the basis that the
payload left the silo on a ballistic trajectory (if the rumours are
correct, and I emphasize there's no confirmation yet), I think I'm going
to group it with the prelaunch explosions (Discoverer 0 et al)  rather
than the orbital launch failures, and therefore it won't appear in my log.
Aren't you all glad someone spends this much energy worrying about things
like this?

Lost and Found Department
-------------------------

I've nearly completed a survey of world launch pad locations. I'm
missing several locations, contributions with 0.1 degree accuracy or better
would be welcome for the following sites whose locations are known poorly
or not at all:

  Site                                          Approximate location

  Green River, Utah                             39.0N 110.2W 
  Le Cardonnet, France  (1950s Veronique test)  ?
  Viking 4 launch site, Atlantic Ocean          ?
  Marka Range, Lista, Poland                    ?
  OTRAG Shaba launch site, Zaire                 8.0S 28.5E
  LC5, GIK-2 Svobodniy                          51.7N 128.0E
  Qom missile test site, Iran                   34.7N 50.9E
  Jhelum/Tilla range, Pakistan                  33.4N 73.3E
  Gillam launch site, Manitoba (1972-1973)      56.1N 96.0W
  Kwajalein Pegasus drop box (planned 2000)     ?
  SAC-B Pegasus drop box                        37.0N 72.0W?

I'll post the full list to the web site sometime early next year.

I'm also trying to find details of the TRAILBLAZER project in which
1-gram pellets were accelerated to escape velocity, and so would have
entered solar orbit had they not been heading down into the atmosphere
at the time. It was an experiment to create artificial meteors; but
I'd like to add the launches to my list of objects that were, however
briefly, not gravitationally bound to Earth. If anyone knows of a
reference where results were published, or has the date of the Meteor-6
flight in 1964/1965, please get in touch.

The special annual launch issue should be out shortly after the new year.

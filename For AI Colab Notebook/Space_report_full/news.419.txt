Shuttle and Stations
--------------------

Mission STS-99 is scheduled for launch on Jan 31 carrying Space Radar
Lab 3, the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission. Orbiter Endeavour's payload
bay contains:
 Bay 1-2:    External Airlock
 Bay 3 Port: Portable Foot Restraint on GABA sidewall carrier
 Bay 6:      Antenna Trunnion Structure
 Bay 8-9:    Spacelab Pallet
 Bay 11:     Antenna Trunnion Structure

Mounted on the pallet and the two ATS devices is the large imaging radar
payload consisting of the SIR-C C-band/L-band radars and the
international X-SAR X-band radar, as well as the ADAM mast which will
extend to 60m length carrying an 360 kg, 8-m long outboard radar for
interferometric imaging. The outboard mast is a new development,
the rest of the payload is similar to the configuration flown on
SRL-1 and SRL-2 in 1994 (STS-59 and STS-68). 

Sponsors of the mission are NIMA (the National Imagery and Mapping
Agency), NASA, DLR (Germany) and ASI (Italy); the mission is managed by
JPL. Crew are Keven Kregel (CDR), Dom Gorie (Pilot), Janet Kavandi (MS,
NASA), Janice Voss (MS, NASA), Mamoru Mohri (MS, NASDA-Japan), Gerhard
Thiele (MS, ESA).

Recent Launches
---------------


The first launch of 2000 was Lockheed Martin Astronautics's Atlas
AC-138. The Atlas IIA rocket took off from Cape Canaveral and placed a
Lockheed Martin/Valley Forge DSCS III satellite in geostationary
transfer orbit, attached to an IABS upper stage. The DSCS III, serial
number B-8, is part of the US Air Force's Defense Satellite
Communications System and will be parked over the Pacific. Mass is about
900 kg dry.

AC-138 entered a 148 x 899 km x 29.3 deg parking orbit at 0113 UTC
on Jan 21. At 0125 UTC the Centaur reignited for its second burn and
delivered the payload to a 240 x 35253 km x 26.1 deg geostationary
transfer orbit. On Jan 22 the IABS was scheduled to make its apogee burn.
The IABS carries two Marquardt R-4D engines to place the DSCS in
geostationary orbit.

Arianespace launched an Ariane 4 (42L model) on Jan 25. Payload was the
Hughes HS-601HP satellite Galaxy 10R, which will supplement Panamsat's
Galaxy cable TV distribution constellation. Galaxy 10R,with a dry mass
of 1987 kg, is a replacement for Galaxy 10, lost on the first Delta 3
launch failure. It carries Ku and C band transponders and will be parked
at 127 deg W.

The Ariane 4, flight V126, had two strap-on liquid boosters. The three
stage vehicle flew from the ELA 2 pad on the coast of French Guiana
directly to a 217 x 33232 km x 7.0 deg geostationary transfer orbit.


Zhongxing-22, launched on Jan 25 by Chang Zheng 3A from Xichang, is a
Chinese comsat. The CZ-3A is a three-stage launch vehicle with a liquid
hydrogen upper stage; this was its fourth flight, although the CZ3B
(with 5 flights) is basically the same vehicle with strapon boosters.
The Zhongxing series of comsats has provided domestic Chinese
communications since 1988 for the China Telecommunications Broadcast
Satellite Corp, a division of the Chinese ministry of Posts and 
Telecommunications. Early satellites were Chinese-built DFH-2A models,
and later DFH-3 (Chinese-built but based on a German design). Zhongxing
5 and 7 where US-built satellites; the US government banned the delivery
of Zhongxing 8, built by Loral and intended for launch last year. It's
not clear what the significance of '22' in Zhongxing-22's name is. It's
also not clear what kind of satellite Zhongxing-22 is; I'm guessing that
it's a Chinese-built satellite, probably developed by the Chinese
Academy of Space Technology in Beijing and probably derived from the
DFH-3 (3-axis stablized) design which was of similar mass (launch mass
of ZX-22 is 2300 kg).  The DFH-3 has a liquid apogee engine probably
derived from the MBB S400.It was reported in 1999 that the Feng Huo 1
(FH-1) satellite was to be launched by CZ-3A in early 2000; it is
possible that ZX-22 is actually FH-1 by another name. 

Below I give the list of known Zhongxing satellites and their initial
orbits (the final rocket stage from the ZX-2 launch was never tracked by
Space Command). ZX-22 is the first domestic Chinese comsat to be placed
in a slightly supersynchronous transfer orbit, although several CZ-3B
flights with commercial Western payloads have used a similar transfer orbit.
The high apogee supports the idea that ZX-22 has a liquid apogee engine
rather than a solid motor.

Jan 27 saw the first launch from the California Spaceport, a commercial
pad on a leased site at Vandenberg Air Force Base. The CLF (Commercial
Launch Facility) is near the SLC-6 complex on South Vandenberg. The
launch was the debut of the Orbital Sciences Minotaur, which uses
Minuteman and Pegasus/Taurus stages. The Minotaur is the space launch vehicle
for the USAF Orbital/Suborbital Program which uses refurbished hardware
for small missions; USAF refer to it with the acronym OSPSLV
(Orbital/Suborbital Program Space Launch Vehicle), which doesn't seem
any quicker to type than Minotaur. 

The Minotaur first stage is the M55A1 (Minuteman 2 stage 1); the second
stage is the Aerojet SR19 (Minuteman 2 stage 2). The third stage is the
Alliant Orion 50XL (Pegasus stage 2) and the final stage is the Orion 38
(Pegasus stage 3). The first three stages burned for 3 min 20 s, after
which the vehicle coasted to apogee and the fourth stage ignited at T+10
min 15s to enter a 746 x 810 km x 100.2 deg polar orbit. This is the
first orbital launch to use Minuteman hardware. The US has previously
used refurbished Thor, Atlas and Titan missiles as space launch vehicles.

The Space Test Program P98-1 mission consists of a large collection of
small satellites aboard the Minotaur launch.  JAWSAT, the USAF's Joint
AF Academy/Weber State Satellite, is a 64 kg satellite carrying a plasma
experiment and a particle detector as well as a technology test.

FALCONSAT is a 15 kg USAF Academy satellite, I don't know what its
payload is (their web site describes four possible payloads but
doesn't specify which one was selected for flight).

OCSE is the Optical Calibration Sphere Experiment, a 3.5m diameter
inflatable sphere built by L'Garde Inc. for calibrating the lasers at
the AFRL Starfire Optical Range. Mass of OCSE plus container is 22 kg.
The 0.48m long 0.41m diameter OCSE canister was ejected from the JAWSAT
stack; 42 seconds later, with the canister clear of the other payloads,
the canister door opened and 10 seconds after that inflation of the
sphere began (At this writing, successful sphere inflation has not yet
been confirmed). The canister remains attached to the inflated sphere.
Once inflated, the sphere's material becomes rigidized - I've handled
samples of this stuff, and you'd never believe it had been inflated, its
consistency is something like hard PVC or maybe bamboo... light and
striated but definitely solid.

ASUSAT is a 5 kg Arizona State University satellite with an Earth imager
and an amateur radio transponder. 

OPAL is Stanford University's  13 kg Orbiting Picosat Automated
Launcher. which carries an acclerometer and a magnetometer and four even
smaller satellites called `picosatellites'. The 0.5 kg STENSAT, built by
an AMSAT-NA group, carries an amateur radio transponder. The 0.25 kg
DARPA/Aerospace Corp. MEMS (Micro Electro-mechanical Systems)
picosatellites, carry an intersatellite communications experiment  and
are connected by a 30-m tether. Santa Clara University's Artemis 0.6 kg
picosatellite carries a VLF wave experiment. The picosatellites are
still attached to OPAL and will be deployed later.

Shuttle and Stations
--------------------

Endeavour was launched at 1743:40 UTC on Feb 11 on mission STS-99. The
RSRM-71  solid rocket boosters separated at 1745 UTC, and the OMS
engines were fired in an OMS Assist maneuver from 1746 to 1747 UTC. 
Main engine cutoff was at 1752 UTC followed by separation of the
External Tank, ET-92. The Orbiter and ET were then in a low perigee
orbit. At 1819 UTC a 2 minute OMS-2 firing placed Endeavour in circular
orbit, while the ET coasted to reentry over the Pacific. 

The 61-meter SRTM mast was deployed successfully at 2327 UTC on Feb 12.
A failed thruster on the end of the mast concerned managers but did not
affect the mission significantly. After some problems stowing the mast
on Feb 21, Endeavour prepared for return on Feb 22. Deorbit burn was at
2225 UTC and OV-105 landed on runway 33 at KSC at 2322 UTC. Endeavour
was towed to Orbiter Processing Facility Bay 2 and will be prepared for
the STS-97 mission.

STS-99 mapped the land surface of the Earth between latitudes 60N and 54S
for NIMA (US National Imagery and Mapping Agency), NASA, DLR (the
German space agency) and ASI (the Italian space agency). Some of
the NIMA data will remain secret for use by the US Dept. of Defense.

Erratum: I'm informed that the Progress OKD actually stands for
Otsek komponentov dozapravki, which makes more sense - I was working
from a bad xerox, I guess.

Compton
-------

One of NASA's Great Observatories, the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory,
may end its mission prematurely. GRO's BATSE experiment is more
sensitive than any other current or funded gamma ray burst detector and
the astronomical community was hoping for up to another decade of
operations, but NASA management are worried that a single gyro failure
(following one which failed in November) might eventually mean the
15-tonne satellite would reenter out of control. NASA-Goddard engineers
developed a plan to deorbit it safely even if another gyro is lost, but
some fear that Goddard management may recommend that GRO be brought down
anyway, as soon as this June. This would be a big blow to the gamma ray
astronomy community.

Recent Launches
---------------

The ASTRO-E X-ray astronomy satellite was launched on Feb 10. However,
the first stage of the M-V launch vehicle (serial M-V-4) went off
course. An anomalous vibration was detected 25 seconds after launch. At
41 seconds ceramic heat shields in  the first stage nozzle apparently
broke and fell off, and thrust vector control on the nozzle was lost.

Stage 1 separated at 1 min 15 s; stage 2 separated at 3 min 38 s. The
third stage burn completed at 5 min 21s. Last signals from M-V-4 were
received at 20 min after launch; the payload probably separated from the
third stage at 23 min.

Although the upper stages were able to fire and make some correction to
the trajectory, ASTRO-E ended up with a perigee of only 80 km and an
apogee of 410 km. It may have reentered on the first orbit at around
0230-0300UTC somewhere between East Africa and Tibet or western China
(depending on the altitude at injection); Space Command don't seemed to have
cataloged any objects from the launch.

I estimated possible TLE sets for the launch; very rough and in particular
the argument of perigee is unknown. (Non-TLE aficionados should just
ignore this...)

80 km injection altitude:
1F01226U 00F01    00041.06620000 2.39843756 +00000-0 +00000-0 0    10

The four Globalstar satellites launched on Feb 8 complete the Globalstar
constellation. On Feb 11 the satellites were in a 912 x 932 km x 52.0
deg orbit.


In Russia, the search is still going on for the Fregat stage. The
separate IRDT demonstrator was found and survived reentry well. The
shield deployed to 2.5m diameter on reentry, but failed to extend to its
4m drag chute mode during final descent. Fregat's shield was actually
14m in diameter at full extent.

The Proton returned to flight on Feb 12 with the launch of the Garuda 1
communications satellite for the ACES consortium which involves PSN of
Indonesia, PLDT of the Phillipines, Lockheed Martin, and the Thai
company Jasmine. The satellite is a Lockheed Martin A2100AXX and has two
large 12-m diameter L-band antennas for cellphone relay. The Proton
placed Garuda and the Blok DM3 on a suborbital trajectory. The first DM
burn put the stack in a 200 km orbit; burn 2 was to geostationary
transfer orbit and burn 3 raised the orbit to 6233 x 35946 km x 16 deg.

The NEAR space probe entered orbit around (433) Eros on Feb 14.
Orbit insertion was at 1534 UTC into an approx. 323 x 370 km orbit
(relative to the center of Eros) with a period of about 27 days.
NEAR is controlled from APL in Maryland.

The JAK and STENSAT picosats were ejected from OPAL on Feb 11.
Thelma and Louise were ejected on Feb 12. Unfortunately no
data was received from the picosats.

Superbird 4 was launched on Feb 18. The Hughes HS-601HP satellite will
provide services for Space Communications Corp of Japan. Mass is 1657 kg
dry; it carries 23 Ku-band and 6 Ka-band transponders, a Marquardt R4D
apogee engine and a XIPS ion propulsion stationkeeping system. It was
launched by an Arianespace Ariane 44LP rocket with two liquid and two
solid strapon boosters.

Shuttle and Stations
--------------------

Soyuz TM-30 docked with Mir's forward (-X) port on Apr 6 at 0631 UTC.
Zalyotin and Kaleri have reactivated Mir and are settling in for a stay
of uncertain duration. Progress M1-2, cargo ship 11F615A55 No. 252, was
launched on Apr 25 and docked with the rear Kvant port on Mir at 2128
UTC on Apr 27. Progress M1-1 undocked from that port at 1633 UTC on Apr
26 and was deorbited over the Pacific at 1927 UTC on Apr 26. Mir's orbit
was raised on Apr 29 in the first of a series of three burns.

The next Shuttle mission is STS-101, to the international space station.
Launch is postponed to mid-May following weather delays.

Errata
-------

Contrary to the suggestion in the table in JSR 423, all Ariane 5
missions so far used the "short" fairing. The "long" fairing will
probably first be used for the ENVISAT mission. Thanks to my European
correspondents for setting me straight.

The delay to the Cluster launch, which is also delaying other European
satellites, is actually a seal problem in attitude control thrusters.
Indications are that the problem is minor and slips will be a few weeks
only.

Current Launches
----------------

A Krunichev Proton-K successfully launched Eutelsat's Sesat 
(Siberia-Europe Satellite) on Apr 17.  Sesat is an MSS-2500-GSO
(Gals/Ekspress) comsat built by NPO PM of Krasnoyarsk, with an Alcatel
Espace telecoms payload with 18 Ku-band transponders. The Energiya Blok
DM-2M upper stage made two burns to deliver Sesat to geosynchronous
altitude. The satellite has 8 Fakel SPD-100 plasma thrusters for
stationkeeping. Eutelsat grew out of the European Communication Satellites
(ECS) launched starting in 1983; they have since developed their
Hot Bird fleet of European television broadcast satellites, but the venture
into broadcasting to Siberia is a new step for them. The combination
of a Russian-built spacecraft bus and European communications payload 
follows the trend set by the similar Ekspress A series.

Arianespace launched an Ariane 42L from Kourou on Apr 19. Flight V129
placed the Galaxy IVR comsat into orbit for Panamsat. Galaxy IVR is a
Hughes HS-601HP model with a dry mass of 1895 kg.  It carries 28 Ku-band
and 28 C-band transponders.  After insertion in a standard 219 x 32007
km x 7.0 deg geostationary transfer orbit, Galaxy IVR's R-4D apogee
engine raised orbit to  35765 x 35792 km x 0.1 deg by Apr 27 and was
over 67W by late April; final destination is 99W. The Galaxy satellites
provide US domestic telecom services; the original Galaxy IVH failed in
May 1998, putting pagers out of action across the USA. Over fifty HS-601
class satellites have now been launched, and most are still operating.
The Ariane 42L vehicle has two strap-on liquid boosters; the flight was
the 51st launch of the uprated H10-3 high energy upper stage and the
124th launch of the three-stage Ariane 1/2/3/4 class vehicle.

NEAR-Shoemaker has now entered its operational 50-km-radius polar orbit
around minor planet (433) Eros.

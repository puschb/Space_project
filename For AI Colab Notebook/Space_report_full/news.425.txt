Shuttle and Stations
--------------------

Zalyotin and Kaleri continue their Mir mission with the Soyuz TM-30
transport and the Progress M1-2 cargo ship. On May 12 they left the
station for a spacewalk. The Kvant-2 airlock hatch was opened at 1044
UTC and closed at 1536 UTC. The astronauts inspected the station and
discovered burnt wiring on the Kvant solar array.

Launch of STS-101 is scheduled for May 18.


 Compton Observatory
-------------------

The Compton Gamma Ray Observatory is to be deorbited on June 3. NASA
decided to end the mission because they were worried that if another
gyroscope is lost, the heavy 14 tonne spacecraft might eventually
reenter out of control. Although engineers came up with a way to control
the descent without gyroscopes, NASA felt the risk was still too large.
However, a number of scientists find the decision perverse and are
urging NASA to keep the vehicle operating for now in view of the loss to
science if one of the Great Observatories is abandoned. In my opinion,
the decision to deorbit Compton is wrong (or at the very least, NASA has
not presented Compton's users with a convincingly argued rationale), and
the risks of keeping it in orbit are small, but it is unlikely that the
NASA administrator will override Goddard Space Flight Center's director
Al Diaz and Office of Space Science chief Ed Weiler,  who made the
decision. 

The following is extracted from a letter passed on to me by a gamma-ray
astronomer - I agree with most of the points it makes, so I quote it here.

"Safety is clearly and correctly a very high priority in everything that
 NASA does.  However, it is important to have a realistic safety policy
 that is applied uniformly to all missions.  The question is: Does
 continuing operation of CGRO present unacceptable risk?  The risk of
 continuing to fly CGRO was inconsistently described at the press
 conference on March 24, 2000.   According to the NASA officials at the
 press conference the decision was based upon a casualty risk of 1/1000
 if another gyroscope failed, yet in response to a reporter's question
 those same officials confirmed a risk estimate of 1 in 4 million for a
 controlled reentry using zero gyroscopes."

 "The scientific case for continuation of the mission is beyond question.
 The NASA Senior Review made a strong case for continuing the CGRO
 Mission.  The end of CGRO operations would affect virtually every
 sub-discipline of astrophysics. The study of gamma-ray bursts and
 high-energy emission from solar flares during the solar maximum period
 will be particularly hard-hit.  With the damage suffered by the HESSI
 satellite during tests, loss of CGRO leaves the US with no capability
 for observing high-energy radiation from solar flares during the maximum
 of solar activity.   The loss of CGRO will also be detrimental for many
 of the scientific objectives of presently operating and upcoming
 high-energy astrophysics missions, because it provides
 targets-of-opportunity, all-sky monitoring and coordinated observations
 over a very broad high-energy range.  These missions include: ASCA,
 BeppoSAX, Chandra, INTEGRAL, HETE-2, Rossi XTE, SWIFT, and XMM-Newton. There is no
 spacecraft planned for the next several years that can accomplish these
 objectives. "

On May 14, Compton was in a 482 x 487 km x 28.5 deg orbit. The
observatory was launched in April 1991 on mission STS-37. Launch mass
was 15622 kg (Shuttle Operational Data Book; the press kit gives 15713
kg); different sources give the hydrazine load as 1822 kg or 1920 kg, so
the dry mass is at most 13800 kg. 

Current Launches
----------------

GOES L was launched on May 3 by Atlas Centaur AC-137. The satellite is a
US civilian geostationary weather satellite in the Geostationary
Operational Environmental Satellite series. It is the first GOES launch
on the Atlas 2 class vehicle (the old Atlas 1 has now been phased out).
GOES L will be renamed GOES 11 after it reaches geostationary orbit.
GOES L was built by SS/Loral and is based on the FS-1300 bus. It has one
solar panel array and  a counter-boom with a solar sail. As well as an
imaging radiometer, the satellite carries an X-ray detector to monitor
solar activity.

Kosmos-2370 was launched on May 3. It is a 17F117 Neman-class
advanced imaging reconnaissance satellite derived from the
TsSKB-Progress Yantar'-4KS2 design. The Neman relays digital imagery to
earth via geostationary comsats and is the Russian equivalent of the
KH-11. Neman was first launched in Feb 1986 (Kosmos-1731). The last
Neman satellite, Kosmos-2359, reentered in Jul 1999 after 1 year in
orbit. The Soyuz-U launcher placed it in a 183 x 277 km x 64.8 deg
initial orbit; it raised altitude to 240 x 300 km about 24
hr after launch.

Titan 4 B-29 was launched from Canaveral on May 8. The Titan 4B placed
the TRW-built DSP 20 satellite in orbit with a Boeing Inertial Upper
Stage, serial IUS-22. DSP 20 is an early warning satellite for the US
Air Force; the two-stage IUS-22 solid rocket delivered DSP 20 to
geostationary orbit. DSP 19 launched last year but was put in the wrong
orbit when its IUS stage failed. This is the first fully successful
Titan 4 mission from Cape Canaveral in four tries, a relief for Lockheed
Martin Astronautics.

Another Navstar Block IIR GPS navigation satellite, GPS IIR-4 or SVN 51,
was launched  on May 11. The Boeing Delta II rocket placed GPS space
vehicle number 51 in an elliptical transfer orbit. The GPS Block IIR
satellites are built by Lockheed Martin/Sunnyvale and based on the
Series 4000  comsat bus. The Thiokol Star 37 apogee motor will be used
to circularize the orbit at 20000 km.

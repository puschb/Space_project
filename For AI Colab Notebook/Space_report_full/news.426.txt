Shuttle and Stations
--------------------

Space Shuttle OV-104 Atlantis was launched at 1011:10 UTC on May 19,
starting mission STS-101. This was the first launch with the new
electronic cockpit displays and other upgrades, and it seems to have
gone almost flawlessly. The solid boosters separated at 1013 UTC and the
main engines cutoff at 1019 UTC. The external tank, ET-102 then
separated, with both orbiter and ET-102 in a low perigee orbit. The NASA
PAO claimed it had reached an orbit with a 320 km perigee, but this was
clearly an error - probably the planned post OMS-2 orbit. I'm trying to
find out the actual transfer orbit but the PAO folks don't seem to know
it; it was probably around 52 x 320 km. 

One disadvantage of the increased computerization: in the old days you
could hear the capcom read up the maneuver pads with the engine firing
data, and the astronauts repeat it back. Now they just say "use the
stuff we loaded into your computer" and the rest of us never get to see
the numbers...
  
At 1054 UTC the OMS engines fired to raise perigee to 159 x 329 km x 51.6
deg. Atlantis docked with the International Space Station at 0431 UTC
on May 21.


Current Launches
----------------

The Rokot launch vehicle was flown from Plesetsk on May 16. The
two-stage modified UR-100NUTTKh ICBM, developed by Krunichev, delivered
a Briz-KM upper stage to a suborbital trajectory. The first Briz burn
was to an approximately 200 x 550 km transfer orbit; the second burn
circularized at apogee. It placed two 660 kg dummy satellites in orbits
similar to the parking orbit that was used for the defunct Iridium
program. Simsat-1 is in a 543 x 558 km x 86.3 deg orbit; Simsat-2 is in
a 520 x 544 km x 86.4 deg orbit. The Briz-KM stage made a third burn to
lower its perigee to a 178 x 556 km x 86.4 deg disposal orbit.

Rokot (`roar' or `rumble') is called Rockot by its Western marketers,
EUROCKOT Launch Services GmbH, a joint venture between Krunichev and
DaimlerChrysler Aerospace. This was its first flight from Plesetsk,
using a launch pad originally used for Kosmos rockets.

Last week I identified the Kosmos-2370 Neman-class satellite launched
May 3 as a Yantar'-4KS2 design. In fact, this designation is
speculative; Phil Clark proposed it as the most probable identification.
It would be more correct to say that the 17F117 Neman is based on the
Yantar' bus and is a descendant of the Yantar'-4KS1 design.

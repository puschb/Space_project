Shuttle and Stations
--------------------

Orbiter OV-104 Atlantis was launched from Kennedy Space Center's Launch
Complex 39B on 2000 Sep 8 at 1245:47 UTC. The solid rocket boosters,
serial RSRM-75, were jettisoned at about 2 minutes after launch at an
altitude of around 50 km. The orbiter, still connected to the external
tank, flew up the east coast of the US.

At 1253 UTC the main engines shut down (MECO) and ten seconds later
external tank ET-103 separated. The Shuttle and ET-103 were then in a 
72 x 328 km x 51.6 deg transfer orbit. (Thanks NASA PAO for giving the
figures this time!). ET-103 reentered over the Pacific after one
orbit; the Shuttle fired its OMS engines at apogee to circularize
its own orbit.

Atlantis docked with the PMA-2 adapter on the International Space
Station at 0551 UTC on Sep 10. The orbiter's small RCS engines were used
to gently reboost the station's orbit several times.

Astronauts Lu and Malenchenko made a spacewalk on Sep 11. The airlock in
the Tunnel Adapter  was depressurized starting at 0441 UTC. The suits
went to battery power at 0447 UTC; hatch open was at 0453 UTC. They rode
the RMS arm up to Zvezda and began installing cables at around 0600 UTC.
The astronauts reached a distance of 30 meters from the airlock when
installing Zvezda's magnetometer. They returned to the airlock at 1051
UTC and closed the hatch at 1054 UTC. The airlock was repressurized
at 1102 UTC giving a depress duration of 6 hours 21 minutes.

Two new objects, 2000-53B and C, were cataloged by Space Command around
the time of the EVA and presumably are associated with it. Is anyone
aware of any object jettisoned by the crew? It looked like the
magnetometer cover was carefully stowed away...

The Shuttle undocked from ISS at 0344 UTC on Sep 18 and made two
circuits of the station each lasting half an orbit, before separating
finally at 0534 UTC. Your bleary-eyed correspondent can report that the
two spacecraft were an incredible sight in the dawn Boston sky at 0950
UTC the same day, flying a few degrees apart and each about as bright as
Jupiter.

The payload bay doors were closed at 0414 UTC on Sep 20 and at 0650 UTC
the OMS engines ignited for a three minute burn lowering the orbit from
374 x 386 km x 51.6 deg to 22 x 380 km x 51.6 deg. After entry interface
at 0725 UTC, the orbiter glided to a landing on runway 15 at Kennedy
Space Center with main gear touchdown at 0756:48 UTC for
a mission duration of 283hr 11min.

Meanwhile, Discovery is on the pad ready for the next mission, STS-92.
It will launch in early October and dock with PMA-2, the docking port on
the +Y port of the Space Station's Unity module. The mission will carry
the orbiter docking system, the Z1 truss, a Spacelab pallet with the
PMA-3 docking unit, and two adapter beams carrying electronic control
units for Z1. Both the Z1 and the PMA-3 will be attached to the Unity
node. Z1 was built by Boeing/Canoga Park and is 3.5 x 4.5 meters in
size; it will be docked to the +Z port on Unity. PMA-3, built by
Boeing/Huntington Beach, will be docked to the -Z port opposite it.
(PMA-1, and Zarya, are docked to the -Y port; Unity's two remaining
ports will later be used for the Airlock and the Cupola observation
area).

German Stepanovich Titov, the fourth human in space, died on Sep 20.
He was the pilot of Vostok-2. 

Current Launches
----------------

Ariane 506 (flight V130) was launched on Sep 14 from Kourou. The Ariane
5 launch vehicle is Europe's largest rocket, with two strapon solid
boosters (EAP) and a liquid hydrogen engined core stage (EPC), with a
storable propellant upper stage (EPS). The EPC main stage entered a
marginal orbit with an apogee around 1000 km and reentered over the
Galapagos. The EPS upper stage separated from the EPC ten minutes after
launch and burned to place Astra 2B and GE 7 in geostationary transfer
orbit. This is the fourth success in a row for Ariane 5 following two
early test failures.

Astra 2B is an Astrium/Toulouse Eurostar 2000+ television broadcast
satellite owned by the Luxembourg-based Societe Europeene de Satellites.
Its dry mass is around 1400 kg and it carries about 1900 kg of fuel at
launch. The satellite will be stationed at 28.2E and will replace the
German DFS Kopernikus system. It carries 28 Ku-band transponders. Astra
2B is the 18th Eurostar 2000 launched. By Sep 19 Astra 2B was in a 
31153 x 35762 km x 0.3 deg orbit, approaching geosynchronous altitude.

Here is a list of Eurostar 2000 satellites. Some of the dry masses are
guesses. I believe all ES2000 satellites use the Primex R-4D liquid
apogee engine. Transponder numbers should be considered approximate,
since some sources do or do not include 'spare' transponders.

The SES Astra system includes Astra 1A (AS4000), Astra 1B (AS5000), and
Astra 1C, 1D, 1E, 1F, 1G, 1H and 2A (Hughes HS-601). Astra 2B is the
first SES satellite built by a European prime contractor.

The second communications satellite payload on Ariane V130 was GE 7, for
GE Americom. The satellite will provide cable TV distribution coverage
over the US and has 24 C-band transponders. Its mass is 912 kg and it
carries 1023 kg of fuel at launch. The satellite is an A2100A model
built by  Lockheed Martin/Sunnyvale, the first lightweight A2100 with a
mass about half that of earlier A2100 satellites.  On Sep 19 GE 7 was in
a  35832 x 35869 km x 0.1 deg orbit drifting over 146 deg W, having
entered the GEO altitude range around Sep 18. 

GE 7 continues one of the longest series of commercial communications
satellites, which began with Americom's RCA Satcom 1 in 1975 (Americom
was then owned by RCA). All the satellites were built by RCA
Astro Space/East Windsor and its successors (now LMMS/Sunnyvale).

Here is a list of LMMS A2100 series satellites; some of the variant
designations may be incorrect and updates would be appreciated. Some of
the dry masses are guesses. I believe all A2100 satellites use the RO
Leros 1 liquid apogee engine. Transponder numbers should be considered
approximate, since some sources do or do not include 'spare' transponders.

The NOAA-L polar orbit weather satellite was launched Sep 21 from
Vandenberg; it will now be renamed NOAA 16. The satellite is an Advanced
Tiros N model built by Lockheed Martin and carries a suite of imaging
and sounding instruments. The two-stage Titan II launch vehicle, serial
23G-13, put NOAA-L in a suborbital trajectory of approximately -2500 x
800 km x 98.0 deg. The spacecraft's Thiokol Star 37XFP solid motor fired
at apogee to circularize the sun-synchronous orbit at around 800 km. The
NOAA satellites form the POES (Polar Operational Environmental
Satellite) low orbit constellation which complements the GOES
geostationary constellation, and are the programmatic descendants of the
original Tiros 1 weather satellite launched in 1960. They are developed
by NASA-GSFC and operated by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration (NOAA). Mass of NOAA 16 after orbit insertion is about
1476 kg.

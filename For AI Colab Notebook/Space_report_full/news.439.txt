The Pedants' Millenium
----------------------

As I'm sure you're all aware, the new century and the new millenium are
only a few weeks away. In the spirit of true pedantry, I note that 
Millenium Eve, by the Julian calendar in use at the last millenium -
i.e.,  prid. Kal. Ian. A.D. 2001 (O.S.), or 31 Dec 2000 (O.S.) in modern
notation, - occurs on Saturday 2001 Jan 13 (N.S.) on the modern
Gregorian calendar. Any readers in the Boston area are invited to my
Millenium Eve party on that date, email for details. To all the other
pedants out there, very best wishes for the coming new century.

Shuttle and Stations
--------------------

The Expedition One crew remains aboard Space Station Alpha. The Progress
M1-4 cargo ship was launched at 0132:36 UTC on Nov 16. The vehicle is
probably spacecraft Progress M1 No. 253.  Progress M1-4 made rendezvous
with the Station on Nov 18. After problems with the automatic system,
Gidzenko took over manual control with the remote TORU system at 0302
UTC. After one failed attempt when M1-4 got to only 5m from docking at
0309 UTC, docking was  successfully achieved at 0348 UTC at Zarya's
nadir port. The problem with the TORU system is that the TV camera on
the Progress, which Gidzenko uses to steer the vehicle with, is not that
great and tends to ice up quickly when the Progress is in shadow.

Issue 9/2000 of Novosti Kosmonavtiki, which just arrived here, has an
interesting article on the history of the Zvezda Service Module which
reports that the main hull of the Service Module was built as early as
1985, when it was thought that the vehicle - DOS-7K No. 8 - would form
the core of a Mir-2 space station. Zvezda's forward section is the PKhO
(Perekhodniy Otsek, transfer compartment) with three passive SSVP-M
G8000 docking ports, one on the axis (docked to Zarya), one zenith and
one nadir, plus a side airlock hatch for spacewalks.  Behind PKhO is the
RO (Rabochiy Otsek, working compartment) with 2.9m and 4.1m diameter
sections. The small section carries the two large solar arrays. Further
back is the AO (Agregatniy Otsek, equipment module) with the main ODU
twin S5.79 engines. Inside the AO is is the smaller cylinder of the PK,
(Promezhutochnaya kamera), the tunnel leading to the SSVP G4000 aft
passive docking port used for Soyuz and Progress.

The next Shuttle launch, STS-97, will carry the P6 truss element to the
Station. P6 consists of a solar array wing, an Integrated Electronics
Assembly (IEA) section with a thermal radiator for the solar wing, and
the Long Spacer (LS) truss segment with two thermal radiators for the
Destiny module (which will follow on a later flight). P6 will be
installed on the +Z end of the Z1 truss; later in assembly it will be
moved to the end of the port truss.

Current Launches
----------------

Arianespace launched an Ariane 5, vehicle 507, flight V135, on Nov 16 at
0107 UTC. The PAS 1R, STRV 1c/1d, and AMSAT Phase 3D satellites were
placed in orbit. The EPS stage entered geostationary transfer orbit at
0134 UTC, followed by separation of the PAS 1R main payload. The two
small STRV cubes were then ejected from the ASAP-5 secondary payload
structure at 0141 UTC. At 0149 UTC the SBS cylindrical adapter which
connected PAS-1R to AMSAT was jettisoned; 50 seconds later AMSAT
separated from the EPS.  I believe the ASAP-5 remains attached to the
EPS, but Space Command has cataloged an object they identify as the
ASAP.

PAS 1R will be stationed over the Atlantic. It is a large Boeing Model
702 satellite with a dry mass of about 3000 kg (launch mass 4793 kg) and
a solar panel span of 45m. It carries 36 C and 48 Ku-band transponders.
PAS 1R is operated by Panamsat, whose fleet includes the former Hughes
Galaxy system. Meanwhile, the Model 601 Galaxy 7 satellite failed on Nov
22, the third such satellite to fall victim to a design flaw in the
on-board computers.

STRV-1c and 1d are small satellites built by the DERA (former Royal
Aircraft Establishment), Farnborough, England. Mass around 95 kg each.
STRV-1c performs accelerated life testing of new components
and materials in the high radiation environment of GTO.
STRV-1d carries an NRL Space Test Program experiment (S97-2),
a camera, and technology and computer experiments.

The long-delayed Phase 3D amateur radio satellite, built by AMSAT-DL
(Germany), was renamed AMSAT-Oscar-40 (AO-40) once launched. It carries
an MBB S400 liquid engine (actually the backup engine for the Galileo
Jupiter probe) and a variety of amateur radio payloads in L, S, C, X, V,
U and K bands, as well as an ammonia arcjet thruster and a laser
communications experiment. The satellite is the largest amateur
satellite yet and the first to feature deployable solar panels. Mass is
397 kg dry.

Just a few days later Arianespace launched an Ariane 44L with Anik F1,
a new Telesat Canada communications satellite. Anik F1 is a Boeing model 702
satellite. Launch mass is 4852 kg and dry mass is 2950 kg; it carries
36 C-band and 48 Ku-band transponders. Telesat Canada became the first
domestic comsat operator with the launch of Anik A1 in 1972.

Navstar GPS SVN41, the sixth Block IIR navigation satellite, was launched
on Nov 10 into transfer orbit by a Boeing Delta 7925. The Delta stage
2 entered a 153 x 418 km x 37 deg parking orbit followed by a 172 x 1144 km
second orbit; the PAM-D solid upper stage then fired to give SVN 41 a
20457 km apogee. The GPS Block 2R satellites are built by Lockheed Martin
and use a Thiokol Star 37FM solid kick motor. The kick motor was fired
prior to Nov 13 to enter a circular 20000 km orbit.

Another Delta launch on Nov 21 was a model 7320-10 from the West Coast
pad, complex 2-West at Vandenberg. The main payload was the Earth Orbiter 1
satellite for NASA's New Millenium Program. Complementing the New Millenium's
Deep Space series, EO-1 is a NASA-Goddard satellite which demonstrates
technology for the next generation Landsat. It flies in formation with
Landsat-7 for comparisons, using a hydrazine thruster to adjust its orbit.
The satellite uses a MIDEX-derived bus built by Swales Aerospace; dry
mass is 566 kg. The main instruments are ALI (Advanced Land Imager) and
the Hyperion 220-band imaging spectrometer.

The second main payload launched with EO-1 is SAC-C, the Satelite de
Aplicaciones Cientificas C developed by the Argentine space agency CONAE
and built by the Argentine company INVAP. The 467 kg satellite carries
a battery of earth observing instruments and will focus on Argentine
forestry and agriculture studies. SAC-C carries a NASA experiment which
uses the distortion of GPS signals observed near the horizon to
derive atmospheric conditions.

The Delta took off from SLC-2W at 1824 UTC on Nov 21. At 1835 the Delta second
stage completed its first burn and entered a 185 x 713 km x 98.2 deg
transfer orbit. At 1920 UTC the orbit was circularized and EO-1 separated
at 1925 UTC into a 682 x 729 km x 98.2 deg orbit. The DPAF dual payload
support structure, derived from Ariane's SPELDA, was then ejected
to reveal SAC-C. After a further Delta burn SAC-C was ejected at 1955 UTC
into a 687 x 707 km x 98.3 deg. A fourth burn put the Delta second
stage in a 697 x 1800 km x 95.4 deg; the small 6 kg Munin nanosatellite
was then ejected from the side of the stage. Munin was built by Swedish
students in collaboration with the Swedish Insitute for Space Physics (IRF)
and carries a particle detector, a spectrometer, and an auroral camera.

A Kosmos-3M launch failed on Nov 20, with the loss of the QuickBird 1
satellite. This is a heavy blow to EarthWatch Inc. whose other satellite,
EarlyBird, failed after a few days in orbit in Dec 1997. EarthWatch's
rival, SpaceImaging, lost one satellite too but its second Ikonos is
operating in orbit. 

QuickBird1 was a 1-m resolution imaging satellite using a Ball
Aerospace BCP-2000 bus. The Kosmos-3M second stage placed QuickBird 1
in a 81 x 614 km x 65.8 deg orbit but apparently failed to restart
at apogee, and reentered at the next perigee over S America. Launch was
around 2300 UTC.

Kosmos-2306 reentered on Oct 30; all the objects released from it
reentered by Oct 29.

Kosmos-2373, the Kometa mapping satellite, landed on Nov 14.
Deorbit burn was probably around 2230 UTC; the Vostok/Zenit-style
sphere landed near Orenburg in Russia at 2253 UTC.

The Chinese Beidou 1 navigation satellite has entered geostationary orbit,
possibly at around 0500 UTC on Nov 6, and is now on station at 140 deg E.

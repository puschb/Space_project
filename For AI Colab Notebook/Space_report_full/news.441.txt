Shuttle and Stations
--------------------

The STS-97 mission has been completed successfully, and Station Alpha
has a new set of solar panels. The Station was observed by several
dozen of us from the roof of the Harvard Observatory as it passed
over at 0006 UTC on Dec 16, an impressive sight at about mag -1. 

Astronauts Noriega and Tanner on Dec 7 performed EVA-3 to fix the
tension in the SAW-2B solar array on the Station. Airlock depress was at
1609 UTC, hatch open at 1610 UTC and battery power at 1613 UTC. The
astronauts left the airlock a few  minutes later, probably about 1620
UTC. After fixing the solar array they installed the FPPU device to
measure plasma conditions near the top of P6 and performed a few other
minor tasks. They returned to the airlock at around 2110 UTC, closing
the hatch at 2119 and repressurizing at 2122 for a duration of 5:14
(depress), 5:09 (Hatch open/close) or 5:10 (NASA rule).

The Endeavour crew then entered the station at 1436 UTC on Dec 8,
delivering supplies to Alpha's Expedition One crew. Hatches
were closed again at 1551 UTC Dec 9, and Endeavour undocked at 1913 UTC
the same day. After one flyaround of the station, Endeavour fired
its engines to depart the vicinity at 2017 UTC Dec 9.

The deorbit burn was at 2158 UTC on Dec 11, changing the
orbit from 351 x 365 km to 27 x 365 km, with landing
at Runway 15 of Kennedy Space Center at 2303 UTC.

The next Shuttle flight is STS-98. Orbiter 104 Atlantis will deliver the
Destiny lab module to the Station. Atlantis has been mated to external
tank ET-106 and solid boosters RSRM-77. The stack is on Mobile Launch
Platform MLP-2 in high bay 3 of the Vehicle Assembly Building. Rollout
of STS-98 to the pad is being delayed because some wiring in the SRBs
needs repair. During the STS-97 launch, the SRB separation system had
problems  when one explosive separation cartridge failed to fire; a
backup system  saved the mission.



Current Launches
----------------

No new launches since Dec 6; an Ariane 5G is scheduled for Dec 20.
(the "5G" designation is used for the generic Ariane 5 to distinguish
it from the uprated versions which will be introduced soon).

The UTC launch dates for EROS A1 and USA 155 are Dec 5 and Dec 6
respectively; sorry about the typo last issue.

Object 26614, originally cataloged as 2000-72G from the Ariane-5 PAS-1R
launch, has been recataloged as 1978-26HU; I assume 72G turned out
to be spurious or unconfirmed. 72F, cataloged as "Ariane 5 deb (SYLDA)"
is actually the conical ACU 1663SP adapter that separated PAS 1R from
AMSAT's SBS adapter.

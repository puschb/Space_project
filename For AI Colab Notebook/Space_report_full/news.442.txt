-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The last issue of the (Gregorian) millennium... Happy New Year to all.
I have updated a number of the launch log files on the web site.

Shuttle and Stations
--------------------

Progress M1-4 redocked to Zarya's nadir port on Dec 26 at 1054 UTC.
The redocking testing out a fix to software that caused problems
in the vehicle's first docking attempt on Nov 18. Expedition One
Pilot Yuriy Gidzenko completed the docking manually using
the remote control TORU system. (Gidzenko is designated "Soyuz
Commander" by the US, but "Pilot" in the most recent Energia press
release).

The next Shuttle flight is STS-98. Atlantis will deliver the Destiny lab
module to the Station. Rollout of STS-98 to the pad is being delayed
because some wiring in the SRBs needs repair. During the STS-97 launch,
the SRB separation system had problems  when one explosive separation
cartridge failed to fire; a backup system successfully separated the
SRB.

Current Launches
----------------

Six small communications satellites were destroyed in a  launch failure
on Dec 27. The 11K68 Tsiklon-3 rocket took off from Plesetsk, but the
S5M third stage failed and the vehicle crashed a few thousand km
downrange near Wrangel Island.  The payload is believed to have been
three Strela-3 military commsats and three Gonets D-1 sats, the civilian
version of Strela-3. These small cylindrical satellites were designed by
NPO PM and are built by AO Polyot; they were intended for a 1400 km
circular orbit inclined at 83 degrees. Launch time was 1856 UTC
according to Interfax. The 11K68 is based on the R-36 (NATO designation
SS-9) two-stage ICBM, with the added S5M stage. It first flew in 1977
and is built by Yuzhmash in the Ukraine. If this launch followed the
profile of the successful Koronas-I launch of 1994 (the only one I have
details on), the S5M stage would have separated from the 11S692 second
stage 4.5min after launch and begun its first burn at around 5min 20s.
The impact zone in the East Siberian Sea suggests that the failure
happened during the first burn, at an altitude between 170 and 200 km,
rather than a second burn failure in which the vehicle would have
completed one orbit. The last launch failure of a Tsiklon-3 was in 1994.
This was the fourth launch failure of the year, following a Zenit-3SL,
a Mu-V, and a Kosmos-3M.

Arianespace launched the 8th Ariane 5G on Dec 20. Flight V138 (508)
carried two communications satellites to geostationary transfer orbit.
The upper payload, Astra 2D, is a Boeing 376HP spin-stabilized satellite, with
a dry mass of around 700 kg. It is owned by the Luxembourg-based company
SES and will broadcast to the British Isles. Astra 2D was in
a 292 x 35835 km x 2.2 deg transfer orbit on Dec 22; no new element
sets have been released since, and it may have fired its Star 30 solid
apogee kick motor.

Underneath the SYLDA 5 adapter Ariane V138 carried GE 8, a C-band TV and
data distribution satellite for GE Americom. It is jointly owne by AT&T
Alascom for Alaskan communications, and is also called Aurora III.
Americom and Alascom were originally both RCA subsidiaries, and in the
satellite communications game Alascom has continued to use the Americom
network; GE operates the satellite.

    Americom/Alascom satellite

    Americom name  Alascom name   Type            Operating dates
    RCA Satcom 5   Aurora I       RCA Adv Satcom  1982-1991
    GE Satcom C-5  Aurora II      GE 3000         1991-2000+
    GE 8           Aurora III     LMMS A2100A     2000-

GE 8 is a Lockheed Martin A2100A with a launch mass of 2015 kg and
a dry mass of 919 kg. It has 24 C-band transponders. By Dec 26
GE 8 had reached an 18656 x 35760 km x 0.4 deg orbit on its way to GEO.

Ariane V138's EPS upper stage carried an ASAP5 small payload attachment
ring with a special camera system and the LDREX experimental antenna for
Japan's NASDA space agency. LDREX was a 6-m diameter antenna which deployed
40 minutes after launch, to test the deployment mechanism for the larger
antenna to be used on the ETS-8 satellite. After the test the antenna was
jettisoned. LDREX has not yet been separately cataloged, and NASDA
does not seem to have issued any comment on the success of the deployment.

China launched the second Beidou navigation satellite on Dec 20.
The CZ-3A rocket was launched from Xichang at 1620 UTC and entered 
parking orbit at 1630 UTC. A second burn of the third stage put
Beidou in geostationary transfer orbit at around 1642 UTC. The 
Beidou satellite is based on the DFH-3 comsat and has a mass of
around 2200 kg including its FY-25 solid apogee motor.
On Dec 25 Beidou was in a 190 x 41870 km x 25.0 deg transfer orbit.


Telemetry has been received from AMSAT-Oscar-40 after two weeks of
silence, confirming that the recently launched amateur radio satellite
is still functioning.

Major Suborbital Launches 2000

I don't normally include suborbital launches in my newsletter because it's
so hard to get comprehensive information. However here is an attempt 
to summarize the larger suborbital vehicles launched this year. Only one
launch by the Russian Strategic Rocket Forces is known, but there
were probably many more. Apogees with question marks reflect typical
apogees of that type of rocket.

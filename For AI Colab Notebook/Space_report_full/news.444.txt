Shuttle and Stations
--------------------

The next Shuttle flight is STS-98. Atlantis will deliver the Destiny lab
module to the Station. STS-98 was rolled out to the pad on Jan 3 but
continuing concerns about wiring in the solid boosters led to a decision
to roll back the vehicle to the VAB. The rollback is expected on Jan 19,
with launch slipping to sometime in Feb.

Atlantis' cargo manifest is roughly as follows:
(once again I haven't found a payload bay diagram... anyone with locations
for the PDGF and SASA please let me know.)

                                               Est. Mass (kg)
Bay 1-2:     Orbiter Docking System                     1800
             and External Airlock
             3 EMU spacesuits (S/N unknown)              360?
Bay 5-13:    Destiny Module                            14056
Bay 4P?      Adapter Beam with                           500?
             PDGF (Power Data Grapple Fixture)
Unknown      Adapter Beam with                           500?
             SASA (S-band Antenna Support Assembly)             
Sill:        Canadarm RMS 202                            410
                                                      ------
                      Total payload bay cargo          17626 kg

There's also the Destiny nadir window shutter and Destiny EVA
slidewire, which may be stored in the External Airlock.


Current Launches
----------------

The first launch of the 21st century was Chinese. The second Shenzhou
spaceship was launched from China's Jiuquan space center on Jan 9. This
flight is reported to carry animals (species so far unidentified,
probably nothing larger than mice)  presumably in a test of the
spaceship's life support systems, as well as scientific experiments,
including China's first gamma ray burst detectors. Shenzhou 2 made
three orbit raising manuevers during its flight. The Shenzhou orbital
module has its own solar panels and will remain operational in orbit;
the descent module was recovered at 1122 UTC on Jan 16. Landing
was in Inner Mongolia.


The Turksat 2A (Eurasiasat 1) satellite was launched by Ariane 44P from
Kourou on Jan 10. The satellite is an Alcatel Spacebus 3000B3
with a dry mass of 1577 kg (launch mass 3535 kg) and a 37m solar panel span.
The satellite was placed in a 162 x 36742 km x 2.9 deg orbit; by Jan 13
the perigee had been raised to 21185 km. The H10-3 Ariane upper stage
reentered within one day of launch. Turksat 2A is owned by Eurasiasat,
a joint venture between Turk Telecom of Ankara and Alcatel Espace.
It is based in Monaco, and it will be interesting to see which country
registers the satellite with the UN. The satellite has 36 Ku-band
transponders and three antennae.

The Stardust probe flew past Earth at a distance of 3706 km at 1115 UTC
on Jan 15, and flew near the Moon at a distance of 98000 km at around
0200 UTC on Jan 16. The gravity assist flyby changes Stardust's
heliocentric orbit from 0.956 x 2.216 AU x 0.0 deg to 0.983 x 2.285 AU x
3.7 deg.

Galileo made a 2326 km altitude flyby of Ganymede at 0825 UTC on Dec 28.
Perijove was 464030 km at 0326 UTC Dec 29. Galileo is now in a  0.53 x
15.47 Gm orbit with next perijove around May 23; future mission events
are still under discussion but a Callisto flyby on May 23 is possible.

The Russian Resurs-O1 No. 1L remote sensing satellite, cover name Kosmos-1689,
reentered on Jan 14. It was launched in 1985.

Confirming earlier rumours, Space News is reporting that Japan's LDREX
experiment launched on  an Ariane 5 in December was a failure. There's
still no information on NASDA's web site.

I present an improved list of suborbital launches for the year 2000.
Thanks to Carl Rigg and David Legangneux for sending me some extra info;
the list below includes those launches I have managed to confirm. Large
rockets not in the list include the Hera launch of Feb 5 (apogee only 60
km, so not a space launch) and the Arrow 2 launch of Sep 14 (apogee
probably 10-40 km). Small rockets such as the Nike Orion are also
omitted. The R-29RM Shtil' launch on Apr 6 was reportedly by PL Borisoglebsk;
I don't know that submarine's serial number. K-18 is the Karelia and
K-407 is the Novomoskovsk. The Topol'-M launched Sep 27 is the first
from a mobile launcher; two sources identify it as distinct from the Sep 26
launch but I'm a bit worried they may be the same launch.

Erratum
-------

In the annual launch log part 4, the Start should of course have been
listed under Russian vehicles rather than "Other". Oops.

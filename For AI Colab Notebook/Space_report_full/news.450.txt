Shuttle and Station
--------------------

The International Space Station remains in operation, with the
Expedition 2 crew of Usachev, Voss and Helms aboard.

The next Space Shuttle mission is STS-100, scheduled for Apr 19
using orbiter OV-105 Endeavour. It will carry out International
Space Station Flight 6A which will continue the outfitting of
the Station.

Here is an initial estimate of what's in the STS-100 payload
bay; corrections welcome.

Recent Launches
---------------

The first Krunichev Proton-M was launched at 0447 UTC on Apr 7. The
improved 3-stage Proton launch vehicle, with a new digital flight
control system and enhanced first stage engines, delivered its payload
section to a suborbital trajectory at 0456 UTC. The Briz-M upper stage
then fired to enter a 200 km parking orbit. Although initial Proton-M
literature indicated the Briz-M usually uses a further 3 burns to reach
geostationary orbit, it appears that only two more burns were used on
this occasion: one at around 0540 UTC to enter a 200 x 35800 km GTO,
after which the Briz-M toroidal drop tank was probably jettisoned, and
one at around 1100 UTC, to circularize the orbit at geostationary
altitude. Briz-M reportedly separated from its payload at 1131 UTC.
Space Command had not cataloged the three orbiting objects by early Apr
8. Anatoly Zak tells me he has unconfirmed data that the initial parking
orbit insertion may have been at 0508 UTC, implying an extremely long
Briz-M first burn, which may have partly compensated for the lack of an
intermediate burn.

The payload was Ekran-M No. 18, a UHF television broadcasting satellite
which will be stationed at 99 deg E. The first Ekran-M was launched in
1987 replacing the original model Ekrans which were first launched in
1977, and have provided television service to the Russian Far East since
that time. The satellite has a launch mass of around 2100 kg and
will replace Ekran-M No. 20 which was launched in 1992 and is operating
far beyond its design life.

The 2001 Mars Odyssey probe was launched on Apr 7 into solar orbit.
Formerly the Mars Surveyor 2001 Orbiter, this is the first spacecraft in
the revamped NASA Mars Exploration Program. Built by Lockheed Martin
Astronautics (Denver) and JPL, the satellite is similar to Mars Climate
Orbiter. It carries a 6-meter boom with a gamma ray spectrometer for
remote sensing of Martian surface mineralogy, as well as an infrared
imager and a radiation environment monitor. Mars Odyssey (the "2001"
seems to be dropped in informal use) will reach Mars orbit in October.
The probe has a dry mass of 376 kg and carries 349 kg of propellant.

2001 Mars Odyssey was launched by a Boeing Delta 7925 from Cape
Canaveral and entered a 195 x 215 km x 52 (?) deg parking orbit 10 min
after launch. After a 12 minute coast the Delta second stage fired again
and separated from the third stage, which placed the probe on an Earth
escape trajectory. The second stage's final orbit was 177 x 1805 km x
40.0 deg, the lowered inclination probably the result of the depletion burn.

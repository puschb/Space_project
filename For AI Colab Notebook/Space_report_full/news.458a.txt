Shuttle and Station
--------------------

The next Shuttle flight is STS-105, scheduled for Aug 9.

The cargo bay contains the Integrated Cargo Carrier platform and 
the Leonardo module, and a set of canisters on the sidewall.
The ICC will carry the Early Ammonia Servicer for the P6 truss,
and two small exposure experiments PEC-1 and PEC-2 under the
MISSE materials exposure program, which will be installed on Quest.
The Leonardo module contains Express Racks 4 and 5, as well
as resupply stowage racks.

HEAT is a Hitchhiker payload comprising Simplesat, AMTEC and SEM-10, on
two adapter beams on the port and starboard sides of bay 13. The 13P
beam carries AMTEC in the forward position and SEM-10 in the aft
position.  AMTEC, the Alkali Metal Thermal-to-Electric Converter, is a
JPL technology experiment. SEM-10 is a canister with 11 high school
experiments and AMTEC's avionics.  The 13S beam carries  the Simplesat
can forward and the ACE avionics plate aft. The octagonal cylinder 
Simplesat will be ejected from one canister and will test out GPS
attitude control. 

Another adapter beam, somewhere else in the payload bay (please email me
if you know where) carries two more canisters. G-780 is a Mayo High
School (Rochester, Minnesota) experiment to study germination of faba
beans. G-774 is the Microgravity Smoldering Combustion (MSC) experiment.

Recent Launches
---------------

MAP flew past the Moon on Jul 30 at 1639 UTC at a distance of 5200 km
above the lunar surface.

Galileo passed Io at a distance of 200 km at 0459 UTC on Aug 6.
Closest approach to Jupiter on this orbit was an altitude of 350000 km
at 0452 UTC on Aug 6.

The satellite launched on Jul 20 was given the name Molniya-3 after
reaching orbit. It is a Molniya-3K satellite, and not a Molniya-1K
satellite as erroneously reported earlier.

A Peackeeper missile was launched from Vandenberg on flight test 30PA on
Jul 27 at around 0801 UTC, but was destroyed during flight and did not
reach its planned 1000 km apogee.

Russia's first scientific satellite in several years was launched on Jul
31. A Yuzhnoe Tsiklon-3 vehicle took off from Plesetsk at 0800 UTC and
reached transfer orbit at 0807 UTC. The S5M second stage restarted at
0850 UTC and separated a minute later delivering Koronas-F to a 486 x
529 km x 82.5 deg orbit. Koronas-F, an AUOS-SM type solar-pointing
satellite built by Yuzhnoe in Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine, carries a set of
solar physics instruments.

There were 11 launches of earth-oriented AUOS-Z satellites between 1976
and 1991, followed by development of the two solar-pointing AUOS-SM
satellites AUOS-SM-KI (Koronas-I) and  AUOS-SM-KF (Koronas-F), whose
names reflect the two research insitutes who were the original principal
investigators for the experiment payloads.  The I satellite, for the
IZMIRAN geophysics institute, was launched in 1994 and reentered earlier
this year. The new F satellite carries that designation  because the
original lead organization was the Lebedev institute known as FIAN in
Russian, although it also carries experiments from IZMIRAN and other
research centers. 

A new Defense Support Program infrared missile early warning satellite
was launched on Aug 6. The Lockheed Martin Titan 4B took off from Cape
Canaveral into a  328 x 663 km x 28.7 deg parking orbit. The Boeing
IUS-16 upper stage then fired its first solid motor to enter
geostationary transfer orbit. The second IUS solid motor fired at around
1400 UTC placing DSP Flight 21 in near-geosynchronous orbit.
The DSP satellites are built by TRW and have a mass of about 2300 kg.

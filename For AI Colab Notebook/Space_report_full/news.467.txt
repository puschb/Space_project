Shuttle and Station
--------------------

The EP-2 crew - Afanas'ev, Haignere and Kozeev - undocked Soyuz TM-32
from the Pirs module at 0138:30 UTC on Oct 31. Deorbit burn was at 0404
UTC, with landing 180 km SE of Dzhezkazgan at 0459:26 UTC. This leaves
the Ex-3 crew of Culbertston, Dezhurov and Tyurin with a fresh Soyuz
transport ship, Soyuz TM-33, docked with the Zarya module.

On Nov 12 Culbertson and Dezhurov made a spacewalk from the Pirs module.
It was depressurized past 50 mbar around 2127 UTC,  and the hatch was
opened at 2141 UTC. The astronauts completed external connections for
the Pirs module and finished setting up the Kurs rendezvous system. The
hatch was closed at 0245 UTC on Nov 13 and repressurization
began at around 0250 UTC for a duration of about 5 hr 23min.

Preparations are continuing for the launch of STS-108, with
Endeavour now at pad 39B. 


Red Planet - Erratum
---------------------

I can't believe I did this - thanks to alert reader Mike Grabois who
pointed out my use of 'perigee' and 'apogee' when I meant to type the
generic terms 'periapsis' and 'apoapsis'. In the 1960s-70s the
planet-specific terms - in this case I believe `periares', `apoares' -
had a brief popularity, although the difficulty of coming up with new
terms for each new body (how about `perieroticon'  for NEAR about Eros?)
has led to the generic terms winning out for the most part. Exceptions
are perihelion/aphelion which is well-hallowed in use for the Sun;
perijove and apojove which seem to be in common use for Galileo at
Jupiter; in astronomy,  periastron/apastron and
perigalacticon/apogalacticon are sometimes seen for stars and galaxies
respectively.

Recent Launches
---------------

No new orbital launches this week. A suborbital STARS missile defense
target(Polaris with Orbus-1 upper stage) was destroyed during launch
from Kodiak on Nov 9.  A successful Minuteman 3 operational test flew
from Vandenberg to Kwajalein on Nov 7. A Topol' was launched from
Plesetsk to Kamchatka on Nov 1.

Mars Odyssey continues aerobraking and now has a periapsis of 110 km.
Genesis is now arriving at the Earth-Sun L1 point. A malfunctioning
thermal radiator is causing some concern for the health of the
sample return capsule's critical battery, which is overheating, 
but Genesis is expected to begin collecting solar wind samples
on schedule.

Shuttle and Station
--------------------

Expedition 4 crewmembers Walz and Onufrienko made a spacewalk from the
Pirs module on Jan 14. Depress was around 2050 UTC, with hatch open at
2059 UTC and egress around 2110 UTC. The astronauts moved the Strela-2
crane from PMA-1 to Pirs and installed it there; the Strela-1 crane was
already functional on Pirs. They also installed an amateur radio antenna
on Zvezda. On Jan 15 at about 0254 UTC the crew jettisoned two pairs of
Orlan spacesuit gloves and a pair of towels used to wipe the spaceuits
down, because of concerns about contamination from Zvezda thrusters.
They reentered Pirs at 0255 UTC, with hatch close at 0302 UTC and
repressurization above 50 mbar at about 0304 UTC.

A second spacewalk was made by Bursch and Onufrienko on Jan 25.
They installed plume deflectors around the Zvezda thrusters and
set up some exposure experiments. The Pirs airlock was depressurized
probably about 1510 UTC, with hatch open at 1519 UTC; hatch close was
at 2118 UTC and repressurization began at 2120 UTC.

The next Shuttle mission is STS-109, which will install
new equipment on the Hubble Space Telescope.


Recent Launches
---------------

Lockheed Martin's Titan 4B-38 was launched from Cape Canaveral at 0030
UTC on Jan 16. The Titan core stage shut down 9 min after launch on a
suborbital trajectory, and separated from the upper stage, Centaur
TC-19. TC-19 made three burns to parking orbit, geostationary transfer
orbit, and finally geostationary orbit. It then released the payload,
the US Air Force communications  satellite Milstar Flt-5. Built by
Lockheed Martin/Sunnyvale, Milstar provides secure communications in the
EHF, SHF and UHF bands and has a mass of about 4550 kg. Flt-5 will be
stationed over European longitudes.

Arianespace launched an Ariane 42L on Jan 23 from Kourou. The
rocket placed the Insat 3C satellite in geostationary transfer
orbit. Insat 3C is an Indian communications satellite and
has a mass of 1050 kg empty, 2750 kg fuelled. It carries 30 C-band
and 2 S-band transponders.

Galileo made a 102 km flyby of Io on Jan 17 at 1409 UTC. Unfortunately
the harsh radiation environment made the spacecraft safemode at 1341
UTC; it was reactivated at 0400 UTC on Jan 18. Closest approach to
Jupiter was 322000 km at 1622 UTC on Jan 17. Galileo is now on its way
back to an apoapsis of about 25 million km, and will fall back in to
flyby Jupiter V (Amalthea) on Nov 5.

The EUVE observatory is approaching reentry. On Jan 26 it was
in a 227 x 233 km x 28.4 deg orbit. It was launched in June 1992
into a 514 x 528 km orbit.

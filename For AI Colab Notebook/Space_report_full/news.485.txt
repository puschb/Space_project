Shuttle and Station
--------------------

The Expedition 5 crew remain aboard the Station.  On Aug 16 Valeriy
Korzun and Peggy Whitson carried out  two depressurized operations in
spacesuits Orlan-M No. 14 and Orlan-M No. 23. The first operation began
at 0730 UTC (by my criterion of pressure reaching the 50 mbar mark) and
concluded at 0753 UTC for a duration of 23 minutes. In this depress op,
Korzun and Whitson remained inside the Pirs airlock. The actual EVA was
postponed at the last moment because of a misconfigured oxygen valve in
their spacesuits, forcing the astronauts to repressurize Pirs to 730
mbar to correct the problem. The second operation began at 0906 when the
pressure in Pirs again fell below 50 mbar and the hatch was opened
shortly afterwards. This time all went well as the astronauts emerged
from Pirs and attached six debris protection shields to the outside of
the the Zvezda module. Korzun and Whitson returned to Pirs, postponing
some planned tasks, and closed the hatch at 1348 UTC. Pirs was
repressurized at 1352 UTC for a depress duration of 4h46min.

Another spacewalk was carried out on Aug 26 by Korzun and Treshchev in
Orlan-M suits nos. 14 and 12.  Depressurization of the Pirs airlock 
past the 50 mbar point was at 0507 UTC, with hatch open at 0527. They
installed a storage locker on Zarya, changed out some sample trays for
exposure experiments, and mounted two amateur radio antennas on the
station. The hatch was closed at 1048 UTC and the Pirs was repressurized
at about 1050 UTC for  a duration (depress to repress) of 5hr 43min.
Kudos to Eddie Lyons for helping me with some of the times again; some
are a bit approximate because NASA PAO has a habit of talking over the
most critical moments of the space-ground communications.

Three debris objects were cataloged by Space Command after the Aug 26
spacewalk; two of them may be decontamination towels jettisoned by
the astronauts at about 1019 UTC.

Meanwhile, the Shuttle launch schedule has been revised as the Orbiter
hydrogen flow liners undergo welding repairs.

Recent Launches
---------------

The Contour probe fired its ATK/Thiokol Star 30BP solid motor at 0849
UTC on Aug 15. The burn was meant to insert the probe into solar orbit.
No signals have been received from the probe since the motor firing, and
the Spacewatch telescopes imaged three objects along the trajectory, so
it looks like Contour has broken up. The Thiokol Star 30 motor has been
launched 90 times and fired 86 times (4 no tests due to launch
failures); the 30BP model has had 28 flights. This is a very sad loss
for solar system exploration.

The first Lockheed Martin Astronautics Atlas V was successfully launched
on Aug 21. The Atlas V is a new family of launch vehicles merging the
Atlas and Titan lines, using the Atlas CCB (Common Core Booster) first
stage. The CCB is a 3.80-meter diameter, 32-m long stage, much larger
than and quite different from the 3.05-meter diameter, 21 to 29-m long
Atlas stage used from 1957 to the present on other Atlas vehicles. The
old Atlas stage used a thin tank wall and needed to be kept pressurized
by gas or propellant inside or it would crumple (there is a great video
of a mid-1960's pad accident where the Atlas stage folds in half). The
new stage, like the Titan core which it also replaces, uses a standard
structurally stable tank. It does have components in common with recent
Atlas vehicles, and the distinctive external avionics pod near the base
gives the stage some visual commonality with the old Atlas. The CCB
diameter is the same as the Ariane 1-4 vehicle and marginally smaller
than the Zenit. CCB uses the Russian RD-180 LOX/kerosene engine.

The Atlas V 401 model uses a CCB first stage with a single-engine
Centaur (Centaur SEC). The stage on orbit is a cylinder about 11.7m
long, 3.1m diameter and has a mass of around 2020 kg when residual fuels
are depleted. This Centaur version uses an RL-10A-4-2 liquid hydrogen
fuelled engine.

Atlas V flight AV-001 placed the Hot Bird 6 satellite in geostationary
transfer orbit. Hot Bird 6 was built by Alcatel (Cannes) for Eutelsat
and will provide IP, digital TV and radio to Europe, N Africa and the
Middle East. The satellite has 28 Ku-band and 4 Ka-band transponders; it
is an Alcatel Spacebus 3000B3 class satellite with a launch mass of 3905
kg.

Another communications satellite, Echostar VIII, was launched on Aug 22
by a Krunichev Proton-K with an Energiya DM3 upper stage. The Proton
third stage placed the heavy payload on a suborbital trajectory and the
DM3 make the parking orbit insertion burn, followed by two more burns to
deliver Echostar to its intermediate transfer orbit. Echostar VIII,
owned by Echostar Communications Corp., is a Loral SS-L/1300 class
satellite with a launch mass of 4660 kg - comparable to the similar
Intelsat 9 but larger than other previous SS-L/1300 satellites. Note
that only the payload and the DM3 stage reached orbit.

According to Space Command data, Kosmos-2392 (see JSR 484) launched  to
a roughly 190 x 190 km x 64.9 deg parking orbit; the Proton third stage
(2002-37B) and DM adapter (2002-37C) rapidly decayed from this orbit.
The first DM burn put the vehicle in a 199 x 2889 km x 63.8 deg transfer
orbit; the two SOZ ullage motors (2002-37E and 37F) were left in this
orbit. The second DM burn put Kosmos-2392 (2002-37A) and the DM stage
itself (2002-37D) in a 1512 x 1840 km x 63.46 deg orbit.

Boeing is slowly moving the TDRS-I spacecraft towards geostationary
orbit. TDRS-I has a malfunctioning propulsion system; it was launched on
Mar 8. Burns on Jun 12, Jun 16 and Jul 13 have raised the orbit to 11286
x 35824 km x 15.7 deg, and another burn since then put TDRS-I in a 13324
x 35815 km x 14.8 deg orbit. Meanwhile, ESA's Artemis is now at 33188 x
33310 km x 1.3 deg, using its ion engines to climb slowly to
geostationary altitude.

Japan's National Aerospace Lab (NAL) launched a small NAL-735 rocket
booster with a model supersonic airplane from Woomera on Jul 14; the
rocket exploded shortly after launch. I wouldn't normally report such a
small rocket launch, which wasn't even planned to leave the atmosphere,
but  Aviation Week (Aug 12, p 29) is reporting that it was a Mu-3S2
rocket. This is entirely incorrect - the NAL-735 rocket is much smaller;
it is derived from the SB-735 which is used as a strap-on booster on the
Mu-3S2, but it is much smaller than the Mu-3S2 itself: NAL-735 is about
5m long, 0.74m dia, and perhaps 5-7 tonne, compared with 28m long, 1.4m
dia and 62 tonne for the Mu-3S2. I belabor this now because I know from
experience that this error will propagate into lots of reference works.

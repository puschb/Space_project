Shuttle and Station
--------------------

The Expedition 5 crew remain aboard the Station.  The next mission to
Station is the STS-112 flight in early October.

Fabrizio Bernardini provided me with some details of the installation
during the Aug 26 spacewalk of amateur radio antennas on the Zvezda 
module as part of the Amateur Radio on International Space Station
(ARISS) project. This system has four antenna setups positioned at 90
deg interval around the aft edge of the Zvezda module. Each antenna
setup, attached to the module by means of a clamp to some of the EVA
handrails, has an L-band/S-band spiral antenna, a vertical flexible whip
for VHF/UHF (one of the four is however for HF operations), and a
diplexer which enables use of the two antennas with a single coax cable.
The four cables are routed via feedthroughs on the aft Zvezda bulkhead
and brought behind an internal Zvezda panel which will eventually host
the ISS Amateur Radio station equipment (which is now located at the +Y,
or Unity end, of Zarya). Next year it will be possible to receive  slow
scan TV images using a PC with soundcard connected to a basic VHF FM
receiver.



Recent Launches
---------------

Arianespace launched the Ariane 513 vehicle (V155 mission) on Aug 28,
placing two satellites in geostationary transfer orbit. Ariane 513 was a
standard Ariane 5G; the EPC main stage shut down 9 min after launch, and
entered a trans-atmospheric orbit with a perigee probably around 50 km
and an apogee probably around 2000 km; it reentered over the Pacific
about 45 min after launch. The EPS upper stage fired from T+9 minutes to
T+26 min and entered a 585 x 35865 km x 5.4 deg  geostationary transfer
orbit. Atlantic Bird 1, the upper payload, separated at 
2313 UTC. The SYLDA 5C adapter separated at 2316 UTC and the lower
payload, MSG 1, separated at 2321 UTC.

Atlantic Bird 1 is an Alenia Spazio (Torino) GeoBus (Italsat) class 
Ku-band communications satellite for Eutelsat, the European
communications operator. It will replace Eutelsat II F-2 at 12.5W. The
satellite has a dry mass of 1550 kg and carries 1150 kg of propellant
for its Astrium 400N liquid apogee engine. 

MSG 1 is the first of the Meteosat Second Generation satellites, built
by Alcatel (Cannes) for Eumetsat, the European weather satellite
organization. The MSG satellite is a spin-stabilized cylinder looking
much like the old Meteosats (the first of which went up in 1977), but
significantly larger. The 3.2m diameter satellite has a dry mass of
about 1000 kg and carries about 1010 kg of propellant. It has a pair of
Astrium 400N bipropellant thrusters for orbit raising. The SEVIRI imager
will take pictures of cloud cover as the satellite spins at 100 revs per
minute. MSG 1 also carries an Earth radiation budget experiment (GERB)
and the GEOSAR search-and-rescue transponder.

An Ariane 44L launch on Sep 6 put the Intelsat 906 satelite in 
geostationary transfer orbit. Intelsat 906 is a Space Systems Loral
FS1300-extended satellite and will provide international communications
services over the Indian Ocean.

Tracking of the three fragments of the Contour space probe suggests they
will return to the Earth around 2003 Aug 16, a year after the apparently
fatal motor firing. Fragments A and B will pass well beyond the
Earth-Moon system's gravitational sphere of influence, with a closest
approach of 5 to 7 million km. Fragment C's orbit is much more uncertain
but it seems it will pass much closer to Earth, with the best fit value
according to JPL's navigation team of 736000 km, but an uncertainty of
over 1.2 million km. The C flyby will occur on 2003 Aug 15 between 0400
and 2300 UTC. The three objects are in an 0.876 x 1.131 AU orbit around
the Sun inclined at 8.7 deg  to the ecliptic plane and left the 1 million
km nominal range of Earth's sphere of influence on Aug 17.

Meanwhile, the Delta third stage from the Contour launch is being
tracked in a 200 x 106160 km orbit around the Earth; in JSR 483 I
mentioned an early orbital dataset which indicated a lower than planned
perigee for the launch, but it is now clear that the data was in error
(as I speculated at the time) and the Delta rocket performed correctly.

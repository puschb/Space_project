Shuttle and Station
--------------------

On the International Space Station, the Progress M-47 cargo craft is
docked to the aft Zvezda port and the Soyuz TMA-1 transport ship is
docked to the Pirs module. Soyuz TMA-2 will be launched in April or May
carrying the new Expedition 7 crew of Yuriy Malenchenko and Edward Lu. 

Expedition 6 astronauts Bowersox and Pettit carried out a spacewalk on
Apr 8. The Quest airlock was depressurized to below 50 mbar by around
1236 UTC with the hatch open at 1240 UTC. The hatch was closed at 1901
UTC and the airlock was repressurized at 1906 UTC. The astronauts
reconfigured some connectors and power cables and deployed a boom on one
of the CETA transport carts. 

The Columbia investigation continues; many of the carrier panels from
the left wing have now been found in the debris, so it's not at all
clear what the small object that separated on day 2 was. It's now
retrospectively been given designation 2003-003B and catalog number
27713; the object reentered before Columbia did.

Recent Launches
---------------

Arianespace returned the EADS-built Ariane 5 rocket to flight with
vehicle L514G successfully launched from Kourou on Apr 9. (Note:  the
Ariane 5ECA launch failure was L517, and previous launches were L501G to
L513G in sequential order.)

The two payloads were Galaxy 12 and Insat 3A. Galaxy 12 is an Orbital
Star-2 small class communications satellite with a Japanese-developed
liquid apogee engine (reported to have a thrust of 100N by the EADS
launch documentation, but other reports suggest 500N). It carries 24
C-band transponders for domestic US communications and is owned by
Panamsat. Launch mass is 1760 kg and dry mass is 800 kg; bus
size is 1.5 x 3.3 x 1.9m with 12.6m solar panel span.

Insat 3A is built by ISRO, the Indian Space Research Organization,
and carries a communications, weather imaging, and search-and-rescue
payload together with a bipropellant liquid apogee engine. The Insat 3A
bus is 2.8 x 2.0 x 1.8m in size with a 13m solar panel span; the
satellite has a dry mass of 1350 kg and a launch mass of 2958 kg.

Launch was at 2252 UTC and the EPC core stage shut down at 2301 UTC with
separation at 2302 UTC into a -41 x 1562 km x 6.0 deg suborbital
trajectory. EPC 514 reentered over the Pacific at around 0022 UTC on Apr
10, while the EPS 514 upper stage began its burn to geostationary
transfer orbit. Engine shutdown was at 2319 UTC. The Insat 3A satellite
separated first, followed by the 5.8m high 4.6m dia Sylda 5C adapter
with its ACU 1194V5 adapter; then at 2330 UTC Galaxy 12 was ejected from
the ACU 937VB5 adapter on top of the EPS final stage into an 868 x 35961
km x 2.1 deg transfer orbit.

Congratulations to EADS for an excellent technical dossier publication
for this mission.

Lockheed Martin launched a Titan Centaur on Apr 8 carrying the US Air
Force Milstar 6 communications satellite to geosynchronous orbit. Titan
4 core vehicle B-35 with a 76-foot fairing was used to place Centaur
TC-23 on a suborbital trajectory with an apogee of around 170 km.
TC-23's first burn went to a 169 x 179 km x 28.6 deg parking orbit at
1354 UTC; the second burn ended at 1453 UTC in an approximately 206 x
35782 km x 26.7 deg orbit and the third burn was completed at 2008 UTC
in an approximately 35730 x 35740 km x 4.5 deg sub-synchronous drift
orbit. TC-23 separated from Milstar at 2018 UTC.

Milstar DFS-6 is the fourth of the Milstar II series carrying both
LDR (low data rate) and MDR (medium data rate) payloads and will be
used for global communications capacity by the US armed forces.
The satellite was built by Lockheed Martin/Sunnyvale.

International Launch Services launched a Lockheed Martin Atlas IIIB,
AC-205, into geostationary transfer orbit on Apr 12. The upper stage was
a single-engine Centaur and the payload was Asiasat 4. The Centaur
reached a 166 x 1837 km parking orbit 15 min after launch  then
reignited to reach a 201 x 47920 km x 27.0 deg transfer orbit. Asiasat 4
is 4042 kg at launch and probably around 1900 kg dry; the Boeing 601HP
satellite with a C-band and Ku-band communications payload will be
operated by Hong Kong based Asiasat to replace Asiasat 1 and provide
direct TV broadcast to east Asia and Australia.

The AC-205 flight featured the Atlas IIIB/SEC (single engine Common
Centaur variant). The Atlas IIIB and Atlas V share the stretched Common
Centaur which comes in DEC and SEC (dual and single engine) variants.
Flights so far are:
2002 Feb 21   Atlas IIIB    AC-204  DEC
2002 Aug 21   Atlas V/401   AV-001  SEC
2003 Apr 12   Atlas IIIB    AC-205  SEC
The Atlas IIIA uses a shorter single engine version of the dual-engine
Centaur used on Atlas II.

The landing sites for the Mars Exploration Rovers have been announced:
the centers of the target ellipses are  14.640S, 184.702W in Gusev
Crater and 2.060S 5.992W in Meridiani Planum (according to JPL; another
source gives 14.64S 184.94W and 2.06S 6.23W; these all appear to be on
the IAU 1991 coordinate system. There are longitude differences of about
0.24 deg between this and the IAU 2000 system, as well as a religious
war between those Martians who prefer the traditional west longitude
planetographic system and those who prefer the new east longitude
planetocentric system).

US Space Command is no longer releasing orbital data for the two
Japanese spy satellites IGS Optical-1 and IGS Radar-1. I gather that the
Japanese defense establishment is under the illusion that this will stop
the North Koreans locating these low altitude, rather bright satellites;
it will be interesting to see how easily the amateur observers can track
them.

Launch of the SIRTF space observatory has been delayed, 8 days before
the scheduled liftoff. The Delta II Heavy (7920H) is a new and untested
launch vehicle, and the latest issue is reportedly concern  about the
GEM-46 solids, which have a longer burn time than the GEM-40 used on the
standard Delta II. 18 of the GEM-46 motors have flown successfully (on
two Delta III missions (a further 6 GEM-46 burned for almost full
duration on the first Delta III before it blew up). SIRTF is a major
science mission, the last of NASA's Great Observatories, and the
astronomical community is eagerly awaiting its debut.

Shuttle and Station
--------------------

On the International Space Station, the Progress M-47 cargo craft is
docked to the aft Zvezda port and the Soyuz S/N 211 (Soyuz TMA-1)
transport ship is docked to the Pirs module. Soyuz spacecraft S/N 212
(Soyuz TMA-2)  was launched on April 26 carrying the new Expedition 7
crew of Yuriy Malenchenko and Edward Lu.  Launch aboard the Soyuz-FG
rocket was at 0353 UTC on Apr 26 from complex 1, pad 5 at Baykonur. The
third stage ignited at 0358 UTC and shut down at 0402 UTC with a
successful orbit insertion. Soyuz TMA-2 will dock at the Zarya nadir
port on the Station.

Recent Launches
---------------

Kosmos-2397 was launched on Apr 24 from Baykonur by a Krunichev Proton-K
with an Energiya Blok-DM2 upper stage. The DM2 first burn placed the
payload complex into a 47 degree geostationary transfer orbit; the
second burn is believed to have occurred at 1100 UTC and put Kosmos-2397 into
geostationary orbit (however, US tracking had not released any new
orbital data as of Apr 25). Kosmos-2397 is believed to be a 71Kh6 US-KMO
geostationary early warning satellite built by NPO Lavochkin.

NASA has announced that the first Mars Exploration Rover launch has been
delayed by one week. They also announced that the delay will probably
make the second rover miss its launch window - however I think they
didn't mean to say this, but just confused the (in the context,
completely opposite) meanings of the verbs "effect" and "affect".
Meanwhile, the SIRTF launch has been delayed to August.

Amateur observers report that the secret Japanese IGS-1b satellite
lowered its perigee on Apr 22. Amateur tracking puts IGS-1a in a 483 x
495 km x 97.4 deg orbit and IGS-1b at 489 x 500 km x 97.4 deg.

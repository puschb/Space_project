Shuttle and Station
--------------------

The Expedition 7 crew of Malenchenko and Lu has replaced Expedition 6
aboard the Space Station. Soyuz 11F732 No. 212 (Soyuz TMA-2) docked with
the nadir port on the Zarya module at 0556 UTC on Apr 28, with hatches
open to the station at 0727 UTC. The Ex-6 crew of Bowersox, Budarin and
Pettit boarded Soyuz 11F732 No. 211 (Soyuz TMA-1)  on May 3 and undocked
from the Pirs nadir port at 2243 UTC. After almost 2 orbits of the Earth
Soyuz TMA-1 fired its deorbit engines at 0112 UTC. The engine and
orbital modules separated from the descent module at 0140 UTC, and entry
began at around 0143 UTC. 

A descent computer failure caused the spacecraft to fly a ballistic
reentry, slowly spinning the craft to remove lift which could send the
vehicle off course if incorrectly aimed. This also meant that the crew
suffered unexpectedly high accelerations of around 8g and landed 450 km
short along the groundtrack. Several parachute lines also broke, but the
crew landed safely and were recovered some hours late. Although there
was confusion for some hours about the health of Don Pettit, who was not
seen on camera initially, it appears that he was feeling the effects of
the return to gravity more than his fellow crewmembers but is otherwise
all right.

There is some confusion about the actual landing time; a ballistic entry
should have made the landing time earlier than the scheduled 0206 UTC
but various sources give from 0207 UTC to 0212 UTC; the time will
presumably be refined eventually.

Recent Launches
---------------

NASA's GALEX ultraviolet astronomy satellite reached orbit on Apr 28.
The Orbital Sciences Pegasus rocket was launched from the company's
L-1011 Stargazer launch aircraft which took off from the Skid Strip
runway at Cape Canaveral at 1103 UTC on Apr 28. The drop was over 29.0N
78.5W at about 1159:52 UTC with ignition at about 1159:57 UTC. The three
stage rocket climed away and the third stage shut down at 1209 UTC
putting GALEX in a 690 x 702 km x 29 deg orbit.

GALEX is a NASA Small Explorer (SMEX) mission with principal investigator
Chris Martin of Caltech. It carries a 0.50-meter telescope and two
ultraviolet microchannel plate cameras (one for the near UV 135-180 nm, and
one for the far UV 180-300 nm), and will carry out an all-sky
survey as well as deeper surveys in selected regions. This will be
the first all-sky survey in the ultraviolet band since the much less
sensitive TD-1 satellite in 1972 - the all sky limit in the far UV
band will be over 3000 times more sensitive, about 25 microJansky
compared to about 0.08 Jy for TD-1. 

GALEX is the seventh SMEX mission, following SAMPEX (trapped radiation), FAST
(auroral studies), TRACE (solar imaging), SWAS (submillimeter astronomy),
WIRE (infrared survey, failed) and RHESSI (solar flare studies).

The Indian Space Research Organization launched the second GSLV rocket,
GSLV-D2, on May 8. The Russian-developed cryogenic upper stage entered
geostationary transfer orbit and deployed GSAT-2, a test satellite with
C, Ku and S-band communications payloads, an ionospheric beacon
experiment, and a solar X-ray spectrometer. GSAT-2 will use its liquid
apogee motor to reach geostationary orbit.

Kosmos-2397 is now being tracked in a geostationary drift orbit of 35892
x 35926 km x 2.3 deg, drifting west over 69E. The upper stage has not
been cataloged; the transfer orbit was 217 x 35911 km x 49.3 deg, a
slightly higher inclination that the standard 47 degree used for most
Proton/DM missions to GEO. The earlier US-KMO mission Kosmos-2379 also
was tracked in a 49.2 deg transfer orbit. Two SOZ ullage motors
have been found in the transfer orbit.

After 33 years, Space Command has cataloged the Agena D rocket stages
1968-63B,  1969-36B and 1970-69B from the first three CANYON
communications intelligence satellite launches. It has always been
puzzling that these Agenas were not in the catalog; later launches such
as 1972-101A had the Agena D in geostationary transfer orbit.  I had
speculated that the early CANYON vehicles had kept their Agena stages
attached for the apogee burn, making them the only Agenas to reach
geosynchronous orbit (the CANYONs were in inclined 1440-minute, 10
degree orbits, not quite geostationary). With the addition of these
stages to the catalog it seems likely that, like the later vehicles, the
Agenas separated in transfer orbit and the payloads used apogee motors
to circularize their orbits. However it is rather surprising that the
objects are only now being cataloged - I hope this represents real
tracking and not just an administrative assumption that the objects were
missed and must be up there. The actual elements are still classified,
although one may hope the general orbital altitudes will soon be
notified to the United Nations as required by the registration convention.

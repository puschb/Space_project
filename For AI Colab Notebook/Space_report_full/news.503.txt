Shuttle and Station
--------------------

The Expedition 7 crew, Yuriy Malenchenko and Edward Lu, remain on board
the Space Station. The ferry ship Soyuz TMA-2 (spacecraft 7K-STM 212)
and two cargo ships, Progress M-47 (spacecraft 7K-TGM 247) and Progress
M1-10 (spacecraft 7K-TGM 259) are docked to the Station.

Recent Launches
---------------

Russia has launched an 8K78M Molniya-M rocket from the northern Plesetsk
spaceport carrying a Russian government Molniya-3 communications
satellite. The Molniya-M rocket is just a Soyuz-U with an extra fourth
state. The satellite entered a 211 x 559 km x 62.8 deg parking orbit,
and then the Blok ML upper stage fired to put it in a 604 x 40578 km x
62.7 deg drift orbit with a 734 minute period; the orbit will later be
adjusted to 717.8 minutes (semi-synchronous) with an onboard engine. By
Jun 28 it was in a 719.1 minute, 631 x 39789 km x 62.9 deg orbit. The
special  orbital inclination of i = 63 degrees,  ( sin i ) squared  =
4/5, minimizes the rotation of the orbit in its plane due to the
oblateness of the Earth, keeping the apogee in the northern hemisphere.

Russian sources have not released the serial number of the payload, but
it may possibly be Molniya-3 No. 65. US sources list it as Molniya 3-53
because it is the 53rd satellite to be given the Molniya-3 name, but the
3-53 designation is not used in official Russian sources. The first
Molniya-3 was Molniya-3 No. 11 launched in Nov 1974; satellite series
built by  NPO Prikladnoi Mekhaniki always start with No. 11 - perhaps
Nos. 1-10 are reserved for ground test articles or something. Subsequent
satellites were launched somewhat out of production order and No. 14 was
never launched, so we can't really guess the correct designation.  54
Molniya-3 satellites and one Molniya-3K have now been launched,
including two satellites which were stranded in parking orbit and given
Kosmos designations.

Space Command has redesignated the two parts of Japan's USERS satellite 
for no very good reason: 2002-42A (27515) is now the SEM, still in orbit
(although still listed as decayed in the NASA OIG site, new elements are
being issued) and 2002-42H (27815) is now the REM, which landed on May
29 (although all the elements associated with it are actually orbital
data for the SEM, and are for dates in early June after the REM landed). 
I think I'm not going to update my own catalog just yet in case they 
switch back again.

Orbimage's Orbview-3 1-meter-resolution commercial imaging satellite was
launched on Jun 26 by Orbital Sciences. The L-1011 carrier plane took
off from Vandenberg AFB at 1757 UTC and dropped the Pegasus XL rocket at
1853 UTC, probably over the standard Pacific drop zone at 36.0N 123.0W.
It reached a 366 x 430 km x 97.3 deg orbit at 1901 UTC deploying
Orbview-3, which uses an Orbital Leostar bus and has a launch mass of
304 kg (probably including of order 50 kg of hydrazine for orbit
raising; other sources imply that the 304 kg figure may be the bus only
and does not include the 66 kg science instrument). This is the third
Pegasus launch this year, following SORCE and GALEX.

 Editorial - A New Home in Cyberspace for JSR
 --------------------------------------------

Although Jonathan's Space Report and its associated archives and data
have always been primarily written and maintained on my personal
computer at home, the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics (CfA)
has kindly provided public distribution for it on the Internet (ftp, and
later www) since 1988.  For a number of reasons the time has now
come to draw more clearly the somewhat fuzzy line between my official
work in astrophysics and my off-duty work as a historian of space
exploration, and to clarify that the JSR is my own personal analysis
rather than the official position of the CfA. This will ensure that the
JSR remains a fully independent source. I have therefore transferred the
JSR to a new domain maintained at my own expense. This domain is:

              http://www.planet4589.org

As before, the JSR will not accept any financial sponsorship and both the
newsletter and the content on my site will remain freely available to all.

SIRTF
-----

Congratulations to my friends and colleagues on the SIRTF team!

The Space Infrared Telescope Facility (SIRTF), last of NASA's Great
Observatories, was launched into solar orbit at 0535 UTC on Aug 25.
SIRTF is built by Lockheed Martin/Sunnyvale with the Cryogenic Telescope
Assembly (CTA) built by Ball; management is by JPL with science ops at
the SIRTF Science Center across the street from the Caltech astronomy
department in Pasadena. SIRTF follows on from the US/UK/Netherlands IRAS
sky survey satellite (1983) and ESA's ISO observatory (1995-98); the US
Defense Dept.'s MSX (1996-1997) was another notable IR mission which
made a galactic plane survey. The other Great Observatories  were the
Hubble Space Telescope, the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, and the
Chandra X-ray Observatory.

SIRTF has a 0.85-meter infrared telescope, with a liquid-helium cooled
focal plane carrying the three main instruments, IRAC, IRS and MIPS.
IRAC (built by Giovanni Fazio's team across the street from me here at
the Harvard-Smithsonian) is a near infrared camera imaging in the 3 to 8
micron range. IRS is a spectrograph covering the mid infrared 5 to 40
micron range. The MIPS far infrared Multiband Imaging Photometer will
cover the 12 to 160 micron range. The spacecraft is 4.45m high and 2.11m
in diameter. It has solar arrays which are mounted along one side of the
telescope and act as a sunshield; the telescope observes anywhere on a
strip of sky roughly perpendicular to the line joining SIRTF to the Sun,
with about 35 percent of the sky visible to SIRTF at any one time. The
spacecraft has a dry mass of 851 kg; at launch it carries 50 kg of
helium cryogen, 16 kg of nitrogen for attitude control, and a 6 kg
telescope cover which will be ejected into solar orbit, for a total mass
of 923 kg.

SIRTF was launched by the second Delta II Heavy; the first, a model
7925H, put the MER-B Mars Exploration Rover into space in July. SIRTF's
less powerful model 7920H doesn't have a third stage but is otherwise
similar. The second stage entered a 166 x 167 km x 31.5 deg Earth
parking orbit, and after about 33 minutes of coast, passing south of
Madagascar, restarted at 0613 UTC to enter a hyperbolic orbit with a
perigee of 170 km, an eccentricity of 1.0061, and a velocity of 11.05
km/s (about 40000 kph). If the Earth were the only  source of gravity
around, the spacecraft would eventually slow to a velocity of about 0.6
km/s relative to Earth. However, on Sep 1 SIRTF will reach the point at
which its orbit is dominated by the Sun's gravity rather than that of
Earth. 

Currently a rough approximation to the Earth's orbit is 0.983 x 1.017 AU
x 0.00 deg in ecliptic coordinates (an AU is 149.6 million km, the mean
distance of the Earth from the Sun, and the ecliptic plane is the mean
plane of the Earth's orbit).  The small extra speed of SIRTF compared to
the Earth will change SIRTF's heliocentric orbit to about 0.996 x 1.019
AU x 1.14 deg with a year about 4 days longer than Earth's. Most of the
energy goes into the small inclination change, but the higher average
distance from Earth means that SIRTF moves more slowly around the Sun,
until by a year after launch SIRTF trails Earth by 10 million km.  By
Kepler's second law, the slowest point in each orbit is the aphelion
(farthest point from the Sun). The aphelic velocities of SIRTF and Earth
are almost the same, but SIRTF will be at its aphelion - and thus
slowest  speed - at launch, while Earth is just past its aphelion and 
starting to speed up again. This means that SIRTF will start falling
behind the Earth right away. To achieve this, the Delta must fire
to give SIRTF speed backwards and outwards relative to the Earth's motion. 

[Note for those who, like me, know just enough orbital mechanics to be
dangerous: decreasing the velocity around the Sun would normally reduce
the orbital period. While SIRTF is still near the Earth, the fact that
the Earth is just ahead of it and tugging on it helps to increase
SIRTF's angular momentum relative to the Sun. By the time SIRTF leaves
the Earth's gravitational sphere of influence, it is just enough further
out from the Sun that the larger distance compensates for the smaller
tangential velocity in producing larger total angular momentum and thus
orbital period.]

SIRTF's orbit is called an 'Earth-trailing orbit'; it has the advantage
that the infrared-bright Earth is nice and small, so doesn't block out
large interesting pieces of the sky SIRTF might want to look at. Also,
the total velocity change needed from parking orbit to get to a distant
circular orbit around the Earth by going to transfer orbit and then
burning again to circularize is more than the velocity change needed for
escape, letting you use a smaller rocket. On the other hand, after a
number of years SIRTF will be so far from Earth it will drift out of
communications range - but by then its helium will have run out anyway.
I've put some diagrams of the SIRTF orbit on the web at
http://www.planet4589.org/space/misc/sirtf/sirtf.html

[Note: all of the numbers in this section are estimates I've made based
on the prelaunch trajectory data available at JPL's Horizons web site.]

SIRTF's Delta second stage was also in a hyperbolic Earth orbit  at
spacecraft separation. However, two further burns at 0642 UTC and 0647
UTC are reported to have reduced the velocity enough to make the orbit
elliptical again, with a negative perigee. The stage will coast out to a
high apogee and then fall back into the Pacific Ocean. If anyone can
provide details of the stage's trajectory I'd appreciate it.

Other Recent Launches
---------------------

The Brazilian satellite launch vehicle, VLS-1 serial number V03,
exploded on the launch pad during prelaunch tests on 2003 Aug 22 at
around 1630 UTC. 21 rocket technicians were killed and a further 20 were
injuered. It appears that one of the strapon boosters ignited by
accident. The two satellite payloads, SATEC and UNOSAT, were also
destroyed in the blast, as was the launch pad. VLS-1 flights V01 and V02
both ended in failure.

Kosmos-2400 and Kosmos-2401 were launched on Aug 19 from the northern
Russian launch site Plesetsk. A Kosmos-3M (11K65M) rocket placed the
pair in 1467 x 1500 km x 82.5 deg orbits, similar to the profile of
Kosmos-2390 and Kosmos-2391 in Jul 2002. The satellites are believed to
be Strela-3 military communications satellites.


As I predicted in JSR 506, Kosmos-2399 raised its perigee on Aug 14 to
205 km. In fact the apogee was also lowered to 330 km, which makes the
orbit an even better fit for the standard operational orbit for Don
(17F12) film-return capsule imaging satellites. A Russian newspaper
report (Kommersant, 13 Aug) claims that Kosmos-2399 is a Neman
(Yantar'-4KS1M) imaging satellite, which uses data relay satellites to
return CCD imagery rather than physically recovering film. However, all
previous Neman satellites have had higher perigees and lower apogees
near 240 x 300 km, so I remain a little skeptical of this report.

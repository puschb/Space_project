STS-35/Columbia is targeted for launch Sep 6 with the Astro-1/BBXRT
payload.  Discovery has been mated with the STS-41 stack and will be
rolled out to LC39B tonight for the Ulysses mission. 

Manakov and Strekalov continue in orbit aboard the 
Mir/Kvant/Kvant-2/Kristall/Soyuz TM-10/Progress M-4 complex. 

Ariane V38, launched on Aug 30, orbited the first Eutelsat II
for the European Telecommunications Satellite Organization
and Skynet 4C, a British military comsat.

Feng Yun 2, a Chinese weather satellite, was orbited
by the second Chang Zheng 4 rocket on Sep 3.

Kosmos-2096 was launched on Aug 23. It is an ocean
surveillance electronic intelligence satellite, tracking
radio emissions from ships.

Kosmos-2097, a missile early warning satellite, was launched by Molniya
on Aug 29.  

Kosmos-2098 was launched by a Kosmos R-14 vehicle on Aug 29.  It is a
small satellite in an elliptical 400x2000 km orbit inclined at 83
degrees, the sixth in a series of such satellites.  The purpose of these
satellites is unknown but probably some kind of military technology
development.  It is the first launch in this series since 1983 - a gap
of seven years.  It is also the first August R-14 launch since 1983; in
recent years as the R-14 vehicle is phased out in favour of the Tsiklon,
launches have been confined to certain periods within the year.

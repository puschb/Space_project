The Cassini space probe entered Saturn's gravitational sphere of
influence on Mar 9. This is the Laplacian sphere at 54.8 million km; the
Hill tidal sphere at 94.4 million km was crossed on Dec 16, while the
equigravisphere (static gravitational force ratio) at 23 million km was
not reached until May 18; the latter ignores the effects of Saturn's
orbital acceleration, so the Laplacian sphere is the relevant one for
deciding whether to approximate Cassini's orbit as being around Saturn
rather than around the Sun. On 2004 Mar 8, Cassini was in a  1.40 x 9.28
AU x 0.7 deg heliocentric orbit approaching the Saturnian system (as
usual, I give the orbital figures as periapsis - closest approach - x 
apoapsis - furthest distance - x inclination angle between orbit plane
and reference plane, with the reference plane being the ecliptic in this
case. The astronomical unit is 1 AU = 149.6 million km.) 
On Mar 10 the probe's osculating, hyperbolic Saturnian orbit was
-24450 x infinity km, nominally an impact trajectory. The continuing
effects of solar gravity raised the periapsis height (perichronon
height, if you want to be preciously erudite) above zero on May 4, and
by Jun 11 its orbit was +18093 x infinity km inclined 17.3 deg to
Saturn's equator, with a mildly hyperbolic eccentricity of 1.06 and a
Saturn distance of 11.7 million km.

Cassini flew 2068 km from the moon Phoebe (Saturn IX) at 1933 UTC
on Jun 11. The scheduled Saturn orbit insertion burn is from 0112 to
0248 UTC on Jul 1, putting Cassini in a 19980 x 10000000 km x 16.8 deg
orbit and setting it up for a distant 339000 km flyby of Titan (Saturn
VI) at 0930 UTC on Jul 1.

  Approximate heliocentric orbits, showing how Cassini's flybys
  set it up for the Saturn encounter:
  
  Earth   0.97 x  1.01 AU x 0.00 deg (Mar 2004)
  Saturn  9.03 x 10.09 AU x 2.49 deg (Mar 2004)

  Cassini 0.67 x  1.01 AU x 1.24 deg (Jan 1998) Post launch
  Cassini 0.73 x  1.58 AU x 3.51 deg (Aug 1998) Post Venus 1
  Cassini 0.72 x  2.60 AU x 1.14 deg (Jul 1999) Post Venus 2
  Cassini 0.86 x  7.16 AU x 0.71 deg (Oct 1999) Post Earth flyby
  Cassini 1.40 x  9.28 AU x 0.70 deg (Mar 2004) Post Jupiter flyby

Transit of Venus: on Jun 8, we had the first transit of Venus across the
face of the Sun that has been visible from Earth since 1882. Several
hundred members of the public patiently queued up at 5 am here at
Harvard to wait for the Sun to emerge from the horizon's murk; those who
were far enough ahead in the queue to get a look before it clouded over
at 6:30 am were rewarded with crisp telescopic  views of the Venusian
disk as a perfect black circle against the Sun. Not an intrinsically
spectacular sight, but for those familiar with the travails of previous
generations of astronomers who observed - or were clouded out at - the
previous 1639, 1761, 1769, 1874, and 1882 transits, the emotional
connection to the dawn of quantitative science was profound. The 1761/69
 expeditions in particular seem to me to have been the 18th-century
equivalent of Project Apollo, with the efforts of figures like Legentil,
Captain Cook, and Mason and Dixon reminding us of a day when performing
scientific observations from then-remote (to Europeans) parts of the
planet was as difficult as landing rovers on Mars is now. Observations
of the transit were used to determine the distance from the Earth to the
Sun, setting the fundamental scale for the cosmos. If you missed this
week's transit, mark your calendars for the next one in 2012 - the one
after that is not until 2117.

The Russian Space Forces have renamed Kosmos-2405 as Molniya-1T;
Kosmos-2406 has been renamed Raduga-1. The US-PU satellite launched on
May 28 was named Kosmos-2405, not Kosmos-2407 as I reported last issue.
The new names are consistent with previous Russian practice, so it seems
that the old Kosmos-2405/2406 names were just a bureaucratic error.

The folks at Space Command are also competing in the 'confusing
designation' game. There are now two debris objects called 1968-097CQ
(SSN 05279 and SSN 05515) and two objects called 1968-097CY (SSN 05432
and SSN 05632). In each case one object previously had a designation in
the 1970-089 series; both 1968-097 and 1970-089 launches have large
numbers of debris objects in similar orbits resulting from antisatellite
weapons tests. The logic of the new duplicate designations escapes me.

A Tselina-2 electronic intelligence satellite for the Russian Defense
Ministry was launched on Jun 10  and has been given the name
Kosmos-2406. Launch vehicle was a Yuzhnoe Zenit-2, and the satellite
entered an 846 x 865 km x 71.0 deg orbit characteristic of the series.

The Intelsat 10-02 satellite, a 5575 kg Eurostar 3000 communications
spacecraft built by EADS Astrium, was launched on a Proton-M with a
Briz-M upper stage on Jun 16. This was the fourth orbital launch from
Baykonur in less than a month. After a first Briz burn to a 173 x 173 km
x 51.5 deg orbit, a second burn to a 258 x 5000 km x 50.3 deg orbit, and
a third burn to 309 x 12967 km x 49.7 deg, the torus tank was
jettisoned. At 0214 UTC on Jun 17 the fourth burn went to a 414 x 35849
km x 49.0 deg geostationary transfer orbit, and a final burn raised
perigee and lowered inclination to deploy Intelsat 10-02 in a 4184 x
35804 km x 23.7 deg orbit. In contrast to other recent high altitude launches,
Space Command quickly cataloged all three expected objects - Intelsat,
Briz and the torus tank.

The launch of STS-41/Discovery is due on Oct 6.

Gennadiy Manakov and Gennadiy Strekalov continue in orbit aboard the
Mir/Kvant/Kvant-2/Kristall/Soyuz TM-10 complex.  The Progress M-4
automatic cargo craft undocked and reentered on Sep 20.  As it separated
from Mir, it conducted a plasma release experiment.  Launch of Progress
M-5 is due Sep 27.

Kosmos-2100 is a Soviet Navy navigation satellite, launched by a Kosmos
R-14 from Plesetsk on Sep 14.  The first Kosmos satellite was launched
in March 1962.  The navigation satellite program uses gravity gradient
stabilized satellites very similar in concept to the US Navy Transit, in
1000 km high orbits at 83 degree inclination.  There are two parallel
systems, a military one under the Kosmos label and an unclassified one
with satellites called Nadezhda.  The launch vehicle uses an R-14 IRBM
(NATO designation: SS-5 Skean) as its first stage; it used to be the
standard Soviet small satellite launcher, having replaced the Kosmos
R-12 in the early 1970's, but most of its payload classes apart from the
navsats have been transferred to the newer Tsiklon 3 vehicle.  Both the
Kosmos and the Tsiklon vehicles are products of the Yuzhnoye NPO.

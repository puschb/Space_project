The launch of STS-41/Discovery is due on Oct 6.  Atlantis was slightly
damaged while being remated to its external tank.  This is the first
time ever that there have been three fully mated Shuttle stacks at once. 

Gennadiy Manakov and Gennadiy Strekalov continue in orbit aboard the
Mir/Kvant/Kvant-2/Kristall/Soyuz TM-10/Progress M-5 complex.  The
Progress M-5 automatic cargo craft was launched on Sep 27 and docked at
Mir's forward port on Sep 29. 

The USAF's Navstar GPS 15 navigation satellite was launched from
Canaveral on Oct 1 by a Delta 6925. GPS 15 is a Navstar Block IIA
satellite; future launches will use the improved Block IIB satellite.

A Soviet Ministry of Communications Molniya-3 comsat was launched from
Plesetsk on Sep 20. 

A Soviet Hydrometeorological Service Meteor-2 weather satellite
was launched from Plesetsk by a three-stage Tsiklon rocket
on Sep 29.

Ariel VI, the last of the British Ariel series of scientific
satellites, reentered on Sep 23 after 11 years in space.
The satellite, which operated from 1979 to 1982, was intended
to study x-ray astronomy; unfortunately, it was plagued with
technical problems and did not live up to the reputation of
its very successful predecessor, Ariel V. A British soft x-ray
experiment, the Wide Field Camera, is currently operating 
successfully on the German-led international ROSAT satellite.

Greetings from the great northeast blizzard...

Huygens on Titan
----------------

The European Space Agency's Huygens probe landed on Titan on Jan 14. The
spacecraft reached the entry reference point at 1270 km above the
surface at 0905:56 UTC, and entered the atmosphere protected by its heat
shield. Relative to the target world, Huygens entered from an escape
hyperbola with a periapsis 1100 km below the Titanian surface. By
0910:24 UTC the entry was complete and at about 160 km altitude the
pilot parachute deployed, followed two seconds later by the aft cover
and the main 8.3-meter diameter parachute. At around 0910:47 UTC the
heat shield was jettisoned and the initial parachute descent began,
ending at 0925:21 UTC when the main parachute was jettisoned and a
smaller 3.0-meter diameter stabilizer parachute took over. The DISR
camera snapped remarkable images of an apparent coastline during the
ensuing slower 2-hour descent to the surface. The probe returned
evidence of water-ice rocks and occasional liquid methane rain, with
temporarily dry river channels draining into muddy basins. Touchdown  on
the Titanian surface was at 1138:11 UTC, at latitude 11 S longitude
192W. Huygens continued to transmit signals till at least 1448 UTC when
the spacecraft set as seen by the Parkes radio telescope, which received
the last bits of data 67 minutes later.

Titan (Saturn VI) is one of the largest worlds in the solar system.  I
don't distinguish between 'moons' and 'planets' - it's more interesting
to look at the physical nature of the world in question than which
object it happens to be orbiting. After the gas giants, Earth and the
larger terrestrial planets have densities of 3 to 5 grams per cubic
centimeter - the rocky worlds; These are distinguished from Ganymede,
Titan, Callisto, Triton and the other outer solar system worlds, which
have densities of 2 grams per cubic centimeter or less and are
considered icy worlds.

Deep Impact
-----------

The Deep Impact space probe was launched from Cape Canaveral on Jan 12
at 1847 UTC. The Boeing Delta 7925 rocket reached a 167 x 167 km x 29.7
deg parking orbit at 1856 UTC, and then restarted at 1911 UTC to enter a
163 x 4170 km orbit. The third stage separated and burned at 1914 UTC,
and after separation at 1921 UTC there were four objects on an Earth
escape trajectory: the PAM-D third stage, two despin weights, and the
Deep Impact probe. By Jan 19 the probe was 1.9 million km
from Earth and on track to enter a 0.981 x 1.628 AU solar orbit
inclined 0.6 deg to the ecliptic. On 2005 Jul 3 the 601 kg flyby
spacecraft will release the 372 kg impactor spacecraft and on Jul 4 the
impactor will hit comet 9P/Tempel-1 at a relative velocity of 10.2 km/s.
The experiment, carried out 7.5 light minutes from Earth, will make a
crater and a plume of material, and observations by the flyby spacecraft
and from the Earth will improve understanding of the composition and
structure of cometary nuclei.

Deep Impact is the Discovery-8 mission; the Discovery program was
begun in the early 1990s as the planetary counterpart to the Explorer
missions. One mission (CONTOUR) failed soon after launch and another
(Genesis) had a rough landing but may still return results; NEAR,
Mars Pathfinder and Lunar Prospector were very successful and the
remaining missions are still in play.

Genesis
-------

After the Genesis capsule slammed into Earth last Sep 8, the Genesis bus
was left on a deep Earth orbit. It reached apogee  at 1.28 million km on
Oct 7, and fell back in to a 60670 km perigee on Nov 6 when its orbit
was tweaked to ensure departure from the Earth-Moon system on Nov 17. It
is now in a 0.896 x 0.990 AU orbit around the Sun inclined 0.28 deg to
the ecliptic, according to data on JPL's Horizons system.

SMART-1
-------

ESA's SMART-1 lunar probe entered lunar orbit on Nov 15 in a 4962 x
51477 km x 81.1 deg orbit. Its ion engine has now lowered the orbit to
1014 x 5204 km x 87.9 deg.

Kosmos-2414
-----------

The Russian Defense Ministry's Kosmos-2414 satellite was launched on Jan
20 by a Kosmos-3M rocket from Plesetsk. The satellite is in a 912 x 966
km orbit, somewhat lower than the usual Parus navigation satellite
launches - corresponding to a small underspeed of about 27 m/s. The
satellite was launched into the same plane as Kosmos-2239, orbited in
1993.

A 30 kg student satellite for radiation studies, "Universitetskiy", was
ejected from Kosmos-2414. The satellite was built by students at MGU
(Moskovskiy Gosudarstvenniy Universitet) for the university's 250th
anniversary, and is nicknamed 'Tatyana' since the university's
anniversary day is St. Tatyana's day (Thanks to Tony Vitek for this
information). The MGU web page
indicates that a second microsatellite called 'Kompass-2/Tatyana' is
also planned.

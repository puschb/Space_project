Space Station
-------------

Discovery was rolled back out to the pad on Jun 15 with its new
ET-121 external tank and RSRM-92 solid boosters. Launch is scheduled
for July.

NOAA 18
-------

A new NOAA POES (Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellite) weather
satellite was launched on May 20 at 1022 UTC. The 1442 kg NOAA-N
satellite, built by Lockheed Martin using the Advanced Tiros-N bus,
became NOAA 18 after reaching orbit. NOAA, the National Oceanographic
and Atmospheric Administration, is the US weather agency. Earlier NOAA
satellites were launched by surplus Atlas E and Titan II missiles, but
these have now been retired and so a Boeing Delta 7320 was used for this
mission. The satellite entered a 846 x 866 km x 98.8 deg orbit. It
carries weather imagers, microwave sensors, particle detectors, an
infrared sounder, and the SARSAT-10 search and rescue transponder.


DirecTV 8
---------

DirecTV 8 was launched on May 22 by International Launch Services aboard
a Krunichev Proton-M/Briz-M from Baykonur. The satellite carries Ka-band
and Ku-band communications payloads for US domestic television
broadcasting. By June 2, DirecTV 8 was in a 35772 x 35792 km x 0.1 deg
orbit drifting over 102.9W towards its 101W location where it will
join DirecTV 1/1R, 2, and 4S.

DirecTV satellites launched so far:
  DirecTV 1   1993 Dec 18   Hughes HS-601          GEO 101.1W
  DirecTV 2   1994 Aug  3   Hughes HS-601          GEO 100.8W
  DirecTV 3   1995 Jun 10   Hughes HS-601          GEO  91.1W
  DirecTV 6   1997 Apr  7   Loral LS-1300          GEO 109.8W
  DirecTV 1R  1999 Nov  9   Hughes HS-601HP        GEO 100.9W
  DirecTV 4S  2001 Nov 27   Boeing BSS-601HP       GEO 101.1W
  DirecTV 5   2002 May  7   Loral LS-1300          GEO  72.5W
  DirecTV 7S  2004 May  4   Loral LS-1300          GEO 119.1W
  DirecTV 8   2005 May 22   Loral LS-1300          GEO 102.9W drifting

DirecTV also owns the Spaceway 1 satellite launched in April, now
in a 28255 x 43325 km x 0.2 deg orbit. It reached a 26062 x 45473 km
orbit with 24 hr period on May 11 and since then has been making small
maneuvers to decrease eccentricity, possibly using its XIPS-25 electric
propulsion system.

Foton
-----

The second Foton-M satellite was launched on May 31. The Foton
satellites, built by TsSKB-Progress in Samara, are modified versions of
the Vostok/Zenit design and have a recoverable spherical pressurized
module used for microgravity and life science experiments. A lot of the
capacity on this flight is taken up with European Space Agency
experiments, including an exterior 2 kg reentry capsule called Fotino
which will separate during reentry on Jun 16 and  land uprange.

This is the first Foton launch from Baykonur and it entered a 258 x 291
km x 63.0 deg orbit. The first 12 Foton satellites were launched from
Plesetsk into more eccentric 215 x 350-390 km x 62.8 deg orbits;  they
were followed by launch of Foton-M No. 1 from Plesetsk on 2002 Oct 15,
which failed seconds after launch falling back on the pad and causing
one fatality. 


HAMSAT
------

AMSAT-VU's HAMSAT has been assigned an international OSCAR amateur satellite
number: it is VO-52 (VUSat-Oscar 52). (AMSAT-VU is the Indian branch of AMSAT,
and VU is the international amateur callsign prefix for India.)

Cassini
-------

Cassini made another pass through the inner Saturnian system on Jun 8
with a 156400 km periapsis at 1037 UTC. On this pass, there were distant
encounters with the small moons Calypso (Saturn XIV) and Pallene (Saturn XXIII). 
Cassini has already made a lot of close approaches to Saturnian moons,
not all of which involved science observations.

Here are Saturnian moon encounters to date within 120000 km (for
non-science encounters, I calculated the approaches from JPL Horizons,
and these may be off by 20000 km or more because of inconsistent
trajectory data - best I can do right now. Horizons doesn't have any
Pallene ephemeris data so I don't know how close that approach was, and
for the same reason I don't have a time for the Polydeuces pass.)

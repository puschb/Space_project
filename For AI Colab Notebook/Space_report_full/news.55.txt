Discovery landed on Oct 10 on Runway 22 at Edwards, successfully
completing mission STS-41, launched on Oct 6. The ESA Ulysses probe
is in solar orbit on its way to Jupiter. The PAM-S final stage,
and the second stage of the IUS, as well as associated adapters,
also are in solar orbit. STS-38/Atlantis is due for launch around 
Nov 7, and even Av Leak has not revealed the nature of its DoD 
payload - yet.

Gennadiy Manakov and Gennadiy Strekalov continue in orbit aboard the
Mir/Kvant/Kvant-2/Kristall/Soyuz TM-10/Progress M-5 complex.  
Progress M-5 carries a VBS (Vosvrashchaemaya Ballisticheskaya Kapsula)
ballistic recovery capsule which will carry the results of materials
processing experiments carried out in the Kristall module back
to a landing in Kazakhstan. Progress M-5 used its engine to raise
the Mir complex orbit on Oct 1 from  370x406 km to 373x420 km.
The Salyut-7/Kosmos-1686 complex continues to decay slowly; its
orbit is now 344x346 km high.

A Soviet electronic intelligence satellite was destroyed on Oct 4 
when the first stage of its Zenit launch vehicle exploded seconds
after launch from Kosmodrom Baykonur. This is the first failure
of a Zenit to reach orbit, although the upper stage of Kosmos-1714
failed to restart. The satellite would have been Kosmos-2102 had
it reached orbit.

Kosmos-2101 was launched on Oct 1 into an inital 170x296 km orbit by
Soyuz from Baykonur.  It is a photographic imaging recon satellite
operated by the GRU (Soviet military intelligence).  Kosmos-2101 will
remain in orbit until about Nov 14; unlike the high-resolution
Kosmos-2089, which reentered the same day, it has maneuvered into a
relatively high perigee 210x290 km orbit, suggesting that it is a
mapping flight.  The only other Soviet imaging satellite now in orbit is
Kosmos-2072, an advanced digital imaging satellite which was in a
237x277 km orbit on Oct 2.

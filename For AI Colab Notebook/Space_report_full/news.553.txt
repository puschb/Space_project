OICETS
------

The Japanese OICETS and INDEX satellites were launched by the Russian
Kosmotras company on a Dnepr rocket from Baykonur on Aug 23.

OICETS, the Optical Inter-Orbit Communications Engineering Test
Satellite, carries a laser communications experiment that will
be used in conjunction with ESA's Artemis geostationary satellite.
The satellite was renamed Kirari after launch. Kirari means
something like 'glitter' or 'twinkle', in an obvious reference
to the laser (Japanese speakers help me out with the translation here?).

INDEX, renamed Reimei ("Dawn") after launch, is a 70 kg ISAS/JAXA
in-house test satellite with  new lightweight satellite components, and
a demonstration auroral imager payload.

Kosmotras reported (and I reproduce here without comment):
 "Along with the satellites, the launch vehicle delivered into orbit a
 special container that hosted the state symbols of Turkmenistan - the
 National Flag and the Book of Rukhnama - historical and philosophical
 work of Saparmurat Niyazov, the President of Turkmenistan, devoted to
 the past, present and the future of the Turkmen state."

I'm guessing the container remained attached to the insertion stage.

Four objects were initially cataloged associated with the launch. My best
guess at identifying the objects suggests that Kirari is in a 602 x 603
km x 97.8 deg orbit; Reimei is in a 601 x 621 km orbit; and the Dnepr
gas-dynamic shield is in a 572 x 607 km orbit. The fourth object, in a
higher apogee 595 x 1197 km orbit, is the insertion stage, which
continues thrusting after it has dispensed its payloads.

It's unusual for Japanese government satellites to launch on non-Japanese
rockets. OICETS was originally intended for the now-abandoned J-1
light launch vehicle.

Hayabusa
---------

On Aug 24, Japan's Hayabusa was 8880 km from asteroid Itokawa; by Sep 2
it was at only 1550 km. Hayabusa will rendezvous with Itokawa and
return a sample of it to Earth.


Monitor-E
---------

The Russian Krunichev company, best known for the Proton rocket,
launched the first Monitor Earth observing platform on Aug 26 on one of
its Rokot/Briz-KM rockets. Monitor-E No. 1 is a prototype carrying
8-meter and 20-meter resolution cameras. The satellte's Yachta bus is
1.2m high at launch (I don't know the solar panel span, probably about
4m). A mockup was launched on an earlier Rokot flight in 2003.

Kosmos-2415
-----------

A Russian Defense Ministry satellite, with the cover name Kosmos-2415,
was launched on Sep 2 from Baykonur into a 197 x 284 km x 64.8 deg
orbit. It is believed to be an 11F660 Kometa mapping satellite, and the
initial orbit is consistent with this. I expect it will raise its orbit
to about 210 x 270 km within one day. The last Kometa mission was in
2000. Kometa is built by TsSKB-Progress of Samara, who also build
the Soyuz-U rocket.

FSW satellites
--------------

China's FSW 21 recoverable satellite returned to Earth on Aug 29,
the same day that FSW 22 was launched on a CZ-2D rocket from China's
Jiuquan Space Center. Neither the FSW 21 landing time nor the
FSW 22 launch time were announced; from analysis of orbital data
I estimate an FSW 22 launch time of 0845 UTC, and an FSW 21 landing
time of 2335 UTC on Aug 28 (which is Aug 29 Chinese local time).

The FSW (Fanhui Shi Weixing, Experimental Recoverable Satellite) program
began in 1974; the program went through several versions until launches
stopped in 1996, performing both military imaging and commercial
microgravity missions. 

In 2003, a new series of FSW satellites (some sources believe their
military code-name is Jian Bing 4) came into service, starting with FSW
18. With FSW 22, there are five launches in this series and we can now
see two subgroups. The low perigee subgroup uses the older Long March 2C
rocket and flies for 26 days in 168 x 550 km orbits - presumably for
high resolution imaging. The high perigee subgroup uses the Long March
2D launch vehicle and its satellites operate in 200 x 320 km orbits,
with recovery after 18 days. Their orbits are similar to the
8-day-duration FSW-1 series of 1987-1993. They are launched in pairs: a
low-perigee mission followed soon after by a high perigee mission. It's
not clear whether the vehicles are two different spacecraft designs or
just different mission profiles for the same spacecraft, but the longer
life for the lower-perigee (and therefore higher fuel use) mission
suggests that it's probably two different designs.

Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter
---------------------------

Aerojet provided me with more details on the MRO propulsion system:
Mars orbit insertion is provided by six MR-107N engines with 270N thrust
each (not 170N as I said in JSR552), salvaged from the backup Mars Polar
Lander. The system also has six MR-106E engines with 22N thrust and
eight small MR-103D engines with 1N thrust.

The propulsion system made a 7.8m/s course correction on Aug 27.

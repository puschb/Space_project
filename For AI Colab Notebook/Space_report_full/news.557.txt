Station
-------

The Expedition 12 crew - Bill McArthur and Valeriy Tokarev - boarded the
Soyuz TMA-7 ferry ship on Nov 18 and undocked from the Pirs module at
0846 UTC, backing off and then redocking with the Zarya module at 0905
UTC. The procedure allows spacewalks to be made from the Pirs module.

Venus Express
-------------

Europe's latest space probe was launched from Baykonur on Nov 9
and is now in solar orbit en route to Venus.

Venus Express (VEX) was built as a cheap copy of the Mars Express
design, which itself used the basic bus developed for the Rosetta comet
probe. VEX carries the VMC Venus Monitoring Camera, the VIRTIS
ultraviolet-visible-infrared imaging spectrometer, the SPICAV
solar-stellar ultraviolet/infrared spectrometer, the PFS infrared
planetary fourier spectrometer, the ASPERA plasma instrument, the VERA
Venus Radio Science instrument, and a magnetometer. The mission
will study the atmosphere and environment of Venus.

VEX was launched by a Starsem Soyuz-FG/Fregat from Baykonur. (Starsem is
a French company closely related to Arianespace which markets the Soyuz
in its Europeanized FG/Fregat version). The first three stages of Soyuz
fired to reach a marginal orbit of about 30 x 190 km x 51.6 deg; the
third stage reentered over the Pacific at perigee at around 0410 UTC.

Meanwhile the Fregat stage made a small 50 m/s burn to circularize the
orbit, raising perigee to 190 km. After a coast period, Fregat burned
again with Fregat/VEX separation at 0511 UTC; Venus Express and Fregat
each had a perigee of 344 km and an eccentricity of 1.132, putting them
on hyperbolic orbits out of the Earth-Moon system.

Venus Express passed lunar orbit on Nov 10 at 1010 UTC and by Nov 24 was
in a 0.702 x 0.993 AU orbit around the Sun with an inclination of 0.26
deg to the ecliptic. It will arrive in Venus orbit on 2006 Apr 11 at
around 0840 UTC. The first orbit will be around 250 x 326550 km x 89.7
deg. It will arc out to apogee on Apr 15. Manuevers between then and Apr
30 will put it in a 24-hour Venus orbit of 282 x 66911 km x 90.0 deg,
synchronizing it with Earth-based tracking stations.  (These figures are
derived by analysis of data on the JPL Horizons web site.)

Inmarsat 4F-2
-------------

Boeing Sea-Launch orbited Inmarsat's latest satellite on Nov 8.
The Yuzhnoe Zenit-3SL with its Energiya Blok DM-SL upper stage
lifted off from the equatorial floating Odyssey platform. Stages
1 and 2 flew eastward into a -2271 x 186 km x 3 deg trajectory;
the first DM-SL burn boosted to a 180 x 294 km x 3 deg parking
orbit, and the second burn put the payload in a
322 x 35803 km x 3.0 deg transfer orbit. 

The payload, Inmarsat 4 F-2, is an Astrium/Toulouse Eurostar 3000
satellite with a large 10-meter diameter antenna for mobile 
communications. Launch mass was 5958 kg. The satellite entered
the geostationary region on around Nov 13.

Hayabusa
--------

Japan's Hayabusa probe approached asteroid Itokawa on Nov 12 to within
55 m. The MINERVA lander was released, but floated away from the
asteroid instead of falling to its surface. Hayabusa then retired to its
safe parking distance at about 5 km. The first of three 10-cm target
markers was released on Nov 9, also into solar orbit.

On Nov 19, the probe again approached Itokawa. Release of the second
target marker happening around 2030 UTC with impact on the surface at
2036 UTC. The Hayabusa probe landed on Itokawa at 2110 UTC, bounced, and
settled on the surface at 2130 UTC. Because an obstacle sensor had been
triggered, the sampler did not operate although some dust may have
entered it. The probe took off again at 2158 UTC. A safe-mode command
sent it around 100 km from the asteroid and it is now heading back to
the rendezvous position for another possible landing. 

Ariane
------

Arianespace launched an Ariane 5ECA (vehicle 522) on Nov 16; it placed
two communications satellites in orbit. The EPC core stage flew a
low-altitude -1047 x 161 km x 6.5 deg suborbital trajectory with impact
in the Gulf of Guinea. The ESC-A upper stage then burned to
geostationary transfer orbit. This was the third flight of ESC-A, which
is a fatter version of the Ariane 4 upper stage; it also flew on vehicle
517 (a failure) and vehicle 521. 

The upper payload on flight 167/vehicle 522 was DirecTV's massive
Spaceway-2 broadcasting satellite. With a launch mass of 6116 kg, the
Boeing/El-Segundo seres 702-2000 satellite is at the upper end of
geostationary payload masses. Spaceway-1 was launched earlier this year
on a Sea Launch Zenit-3SL. Underneath the Sylda-5 adapter flew Telkom-2,
a factor of three lighter and using Orbital's Star 2 small geostationary
satellite bus. Telkom-2 is an Indonesian communications satellite,
continuing the series serving the archipelago that began with Palapa-1
in 1976. Spaceway 1 was drifting east over 117E by Nov 23; Telkom 2
raised itself to a supersynchronous transfer orbit of 563 x 41473 km x
6.6 deg by the same date.

NCUBE-2
-------

It now seems likely that the Norwegian student sub-satellite NCUBE-2
did not eject from its SSETI-Express parent spacecraft.

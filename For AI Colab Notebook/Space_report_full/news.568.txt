Shuttle and Station
--------------------

The STS-121 mission has concluded successfully, putting the Shuttle
program back on track for further Station assembly missions.

Discovery completed its rendezvous with the International Space Station
on Jul 6 and docked with the PMA-2 adapter on the Destiny module at 1452
UTC.

On Jul 7 the Leonardo Multipurpose Logistics Module, MPLM-1, was grappled
by the Station robot arm at 0942 UTC, unberthed from the Shuttle payload
bay at 1012 UTC and connected to the Unity (Node-1) module at around 1150 UTC.
The MPLM contains supplies which will be transferred to the station via
the large diameter hatch between it and Unity.

On Jul 8, astronauts Piers Sellers and Mike Fossum made a spacewalk from
the Station's Quest airlock using US spacesuits EMU 3006 and 3015. The
airlock pressure reached 50 mbar at 1311 UTC. Hatch open was at 1316
UTC, with Sellers and Fossum emerging at 1325 and 1335 UTC.  The
astronauts tested the dynamic response of the OBSS robot arm extension
to check it out for possible use on future missions to send an astronaut
underneath the Shuttle for tile repairs. The spacewalkers reentered the
airlock at 2025 (Fossum) and 2033 (Sellers), closing the hatch at 2042
UTC. The airlock was repressurized at 2048 UTC.

EVA-2 began on Jul 10 at 1209 UTC with depressurization of the airlock
below 50 mbar, with hatch open at 1213 UTC. The astronauts helped with
installation of a spare pump module on the ESP-2 platform used as a
place to stash spare parts for ISS; they also replaced an umbilical
cable assembly for the Mobile Transporter, making the MT ready to
support installation of new Station solar panels on later Shuttle
missions. The hatch was closed at 1852 UTC and the airlock was
repressurized at 1901 UTC.

EVA-3 on Jul 12 saw airlock depressurization at 1115 UTC and hatch open
at 1119 UTC. Fossum and Sellers worked at the rear of Discovery's
payload bay, playing with repairing heat shield samples in a test box
on the LMC (Lightweight MPESS Carrier) in the bay. The hatch was closed
at around 1821 UTC with repressurization at 1831 UTC.

On Jul 14, the station SSRMS arm was used to disconnect the Leonardo
logistics module from Unity at around 1308 UTC and stick it back in
Discovery's payload bay around 1450 UTC.

On Jul 17 at 1207 UTC Discovery fired its engines for a 92 m/s deorbit
burn, with landing on runway 15 at Kennedy Space Center at 1314 UTC.

The ISS Expedition 13 crew on board the station now consists of Pavel
Vingradov, Jeffrey Williams, and ESA's Thomas Reiter.
 

GSLV
----

India's GSLV-F02 rocket failed seconds after launch on Jul 10
and crashed into the sea. It was to have launched the Insat-4C satellite
into geostationary orbit.

One of the strapon motors failed to develop thrust, sending GSLV off
course; by 40s after launch it was outside the planned corridor and it
broke up at 60s; following a command destruct, the debris fell in the
Bay of Bengal not far from the Satish Dhawan Space Center launch site.
This was the second launch from the SDSC's second launch pad.

Genesis 1
---------

Russia has made its first orbital launch from the Dombarovskiy
launch site, previously just an intercontinental missile base.
The Dnepr converted ICBM orbited a US commercial satellite, Bigelow
Aerospace's Genesis 1 inflatable spacecraft. Genesis 1 is a pathfinder
for future human-occupied space station modules. It was launched
to a 555 x 561 km x 64.5 deg orbit. The module inflated from 1.9
to 3.8 meters diameter once on orbit and deployed a pair of solar arrays.

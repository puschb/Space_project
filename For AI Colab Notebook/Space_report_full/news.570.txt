Shuttle and Station
--------------------

OV-104 Atlantis was launched at 1514:55 UTC on Sep 9 on mission STS-115.
The RSRM-94 solid rocket boosters separated at 1517 UTC and the
Orbiter's main engines shut down at 1523 UTC, followed by separation of
external tank ET-118. ET-118 and Atlantis were then in a 58 x 220 km x
51.6 deg orbit. ET-118 made one partial orbit of the Earth, reentering
over the Pacific. Atlantis fired its OMS engines at apogee at 1552 UTC
to raise the orbit to 228 x 285 km.

Atlantis will carry the P3/P4 truss segments to the Station, including
a large new set of solar panel arrays. P3 carries a rotary joint
to rotate the solar arrays, and an attachment point for external payloads.
P4 carries two Solar Array Wings, and an Integrated Equipment Assembly
with batteries and controllers as well as a thermal control system
radiator. P3 and P4 were attached to each other on the ground and
form a single  unit; P3 will be connected to the end of the P1 segment
on the Station (P2 was the name for a segment which was intended for
an earlier version of the Station design but was never built).

 Note: NASA uses a different definition of "cargo".
 Note: OBSS serial number from Bill Harwood's page,
       http://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/current.html
 SPDU is a (Shuttle?) power distribution unit. The OBSS
 is the Orbiter Boom Sensor System, which can be attached to the
 RMS (Remote Manipulator System).

Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter
---------------------------

MRO was inserted into a 426 x 43000 km x 93.3 deg orbit around Mars on
2006 Mar 10. During aerobraking the periapsis was lowered to only 105
km, and friction with the atmosphere lowered to apoapsis. On Aug 30
several months of aerobraking were completed and MRO riased its
periapsis to 210 km. After another burn on Sep 5, the spacecraft was in
an approximately 289 x 440 km x 92.5 deg orbit around Mars, close to
its final science orbit.


Voyager 1
---------

On 2006 Aug 13 at 2113 UTC, Voyager 1 reached 100 AU from the Sun.
Pioneer 10 is at 91.2 AU, Voyager 2 is at 80.4 AU, Pioneer 11 at 70.4 AU.


SJ-8
----

China launched the Shi Jian 8 satellite on Sep 9 from the Jiuquan space
center into a 177 x 445 km x 63.0 deg orbit. SJ-8, unlike earlier SJ
satellites, is a recoverable satellite derived from earlier FSW
reconnaissance and microgravity satellites. It will study the exposure
of seeds to microgravity and radiation.  The Xinhua news agency reports
that the launch vehicle was a CZ-2C. Both CZ-2C and uprated CZ-2D
rockets are used for the recoverable satellites.

Based on orbital data, I estimate that the launch time was 0700 UTC.

H-2A
----

Japan's H-2A F8 second stage, which was used to launch the Daichi (ALOS)
remote sensing satellite in January, appears to have exploded.
21 debris objects were cataloged around Sep 8.


Koreasat
--------

Koreasat 5 (also called Mugunghwa 5) was launched on Aug 22
by a Sea Launch Zenit-3SL into equatorial geostationary transfer
orbit. The Alcatel Alenia Spacebus 4000C1 satellite will provide
Ku-band capacity for Korea Telecom and Ka-band and SHF band 
transponders for the South Korean government's Agency for Defense Development.

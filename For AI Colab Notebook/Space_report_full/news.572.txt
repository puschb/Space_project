Shuttle and Station
--------------------

With the return of mission STS-115 and Soyuz TMA-8, the Expedition 14
crew of Mikhail Tyurin, Mike Lopez-Alegria, and Thomas Reiter continue
on board the International Space Station.
Note that the record number of people in space at once is still 13;
on 1995 Mar 14 with the launch of Soyuz TM-21 there were 13 people in space:

STS-67       Steve Oswald, William Gregory, John Grunsfeld, Wendy Lawrence,
             Tammy Jernigan, Sam Durrance, Ron Parise
Mir (Ex18)   Aleksandr Viktorenko, Yelena Kondakova, Valeriy Polyakov
Soyuz TM-21  Vladimir Dezhurov, Gennadiy Strekalov, Norm Thagard

The record for the largest number of people on a single spacecraft is
10, which happened for the first time aboard the Mir/Atlantis/Soyuz TM-21
complex on 1995 Jun 29 and has been repeated numerous times since
on Mir and the ISS.

Soyuz TMA-8 undocked from Zarya on Sep 28 at 2153 UTC, carrying
Vinogradov, Williams and Ansari. It landed in Kazakstan at 0113 UTC
on Sep 29. On Oct 10 Soyuz TMA-9 was undocked from Zvezda at 1914 UTC
and redocked with Zarya at 1934 UTC.

Progress M-58 was launched on Oct 23 carrying supplies for the Station.

Erratum: Atlantis undocking was of course on Sep 17, not Sep 20.
Thanks to Alexander Anikeev for pointing out this goof.


SOLAR-B
-------

Japan successfully launched the SOLAR-B satellite on Sep 22.
It carries a large optical telescope and an X-ray telescope.
The X-ray telescope was built by Leon Golub's group
at Smithsonian Observatory.

JAXA's Japanese web site has announced that the post-launch name
for SOLAR-B is "Hinode", meaning 'sunrise'. Hinode took
its first high-quality X-ray image on Oct 23; the optical
telescope door opening is scheduled for Oct 25.

Two small secondary payloads were carried by the M-V rocket
final stage: HIT-SAT, a cubesat from Hokkaido Inst. of Technology
and SSSAT, an ISAS-JAXA solar sail experiment. JAXA has released
almost no information about SSSAT - I do not know its dimensions,
mass, or whether it deployed correctly.

Cataloging of the Hinode objects is confused; A is the payload, launched
into a 271 x 678 km x 98.3 orbit and now in a 674 x 695 km x 98.1 deg 
orbit after three perigee raise burns. B is the M-34 rocket casing. F is
HIT-SAT; C and D decayed rapidly - maybe pieces of insulation, or
possibly the solar sail experiment.  A number of other debris objects
are in slowly decaying orbits.


IGS O-2
-------

Japan's secret spy satellite, launched in September, is being tracked by
hobbyist observers in a 484 x 491 km x 97.3 deg orbit.


GPS 58
------

Navstar GPS Block IIR-M satellite SVN 58 was launched on Sep 25 as Blok
IIR-15(M). The Boeing Delta 7925 put it in a transfer orbit with a 20000
km apogee. The GPS satellite's solid apogee motor was ignited on Sep 28
and put the payload in a 20252 x 20471 km x 54.9 deg orbit.


SJ-8 and Kosmos-2423
--------------------

The SJ-8 seeds satellite was recovered in Sichuan province
at 0243 UTC on Sep 24.  The Russian Kosmos-2423 (Don) imaging satellite
remains in a 205 x 300 km x 64.9 deg orbit as of Oct 23.

SJ-6-2A/B
---------

China has launched two more Shi Jian 6 satellites, designated SJ-6 Group
2 satellites A and B. They replace the SJ-6 Group 1 satellites A and B.
China reports the purpose of these satellites is to measure the space
environment, but to my knowledge no scientific results have been published,
and an intelligence role seems possible.

The SJ-6 Group 2 satellites were launched into a 592 x 600 km x 97.1 deg
orbit.


Ariane
------

Arianespace launched Ariane 5ECA vehicle 533, flight V175 on Oct 13.
DirectTV is a Loral 1300 satellite for US television broadcasting; Optus
D1 is an Orbital Star-2 for  the Australia (Singapore-owned) Optus
system. The upper stage carried an ASAP5 secondary payload structure
with a JAXA payload called LDREX-2. LDREX-2 deployed and
then ejected a 6.5-meter antenna as a rehearsal for Japan's ETS-8
experimental satellite (LDREX-1 on 2000 Dec 20 failed to deploy
correctly). 

Ariane 533 took off at 2056 UTC and the core stage separated into a
-1105 x 159 km x 6.7 deg sub-orbit at 2105. The ESC-A upper stage then
reached a 250 x 35780 km x 6.9 deg geostationary transfer orbit at 2140
UTC. DirecTV 9S, the Sylda 5 dual-payload adapter, and the Optus D1
satellite separated between 2142 and 2148 UTC and deployment of the
LDREX experiment was meant to start at 2158 UTC, with separation of the
antenna scheduled for 2224 UTC.

METOP
-----

Europe's METOP A (METOP 2) polar weather satellite was launched
on Oct 19 by a Starsem Soyuz-2-1A/Fregat with an ST fairing from
Baykonur. It inaugurates the Eumetsat Polar System, a European
equivalent of NOAA's polar satellites (just as Eumetsat's METEOSAT
series are the analog of NOAA's GOES geostationary weather platforms).
METOP A carries a wide range of advanced instruments
including ozone monitors, a GPS atmospheric sounding device,
and a wind scatterometer, as well as the usual visible and IR
imagers and sounders. It also carries a search and rescue package.

Soyuz-2-1A consists of an improved stage 1/2 'packet', still
similar in overall external design to the 1957-era 8K71 (R-7) ballistic
missile. The Blok I third stage has the same propulsion system
as that used on the existing Soyuz-U and Soyuz-FG; it will be replaced
with a new engine in the forthcoming Soyuz-2-1B variant.
Soyuz-2-1A was tested on a suborbital mission in Nov 2004, but this
was its first orbital launch and the first use with Fregat.

The Soyuz vehicle third stage reached a -2280 x 230 km x 98.7 deg orbit;
the Fregat upper stage (S/N 1011) ignited at 1638 UTC and shut down at
1645 UTC in a 170 x 820 km transfer orbit. Reignition at 1731 UTC was
followed by separation of METOP at 1737 UTC into a 818 x 826 km x 98.7
deg orbit. The Fregat made its third burn at 1815 UTC into a -31 x 824
km orbit with reentry over the Pacific at around 1855 UTC.

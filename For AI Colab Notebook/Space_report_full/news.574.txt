Shuttle and Station
--------------------

A spacewalk and a Shuttle launch highlighted the past month in the
International Space Station program.

The Expedition 14 crew of Mike Lopez-Alegria, Mikhail Tyurin and Tomas Reiter
continues work aboard the International Space Station. On Nov 22-23
Lopez-Alegria and Tyurin made a spacewalk from the Pirs airlock module.
They used spacesuits Orlan M-25 and M-27 respectively, according to
Andrey Krasil'nikov, who also provided some of the times below.
The airlock was depressurized by 2346 UTC on Nov 22, but the crew had problems
opening the outer hatch; this was finally accomplished at 0017 UTC on Nov 23.
At 0057 UTC, Tyurin launched a 3-gram spherical passive satellite
for the Element 21 Golf Company of Canada, with the help of a swing from
a golf club. The astronauts moved to the aft end of Zvezda. They inspected
but failed to free a stuck antenna on the Progress M-58 cargo ship, and
then relocated the WAL2 antenna on Zvezda which is to be used for docking
of the European ATV cargo ship. At around 0330 UTC they jettisoned
two small cleaning towels. Moving forward to the Zvezda PKhO compartment
they installed the BTN-M1 neutron flux experiment; at 0528 they jettisoned
three soft thermal covers with masses of less than 1 kg. The astronauts
returned to Pirs and closed the hatch at 0555 UTC, repressurizing the
airlock at 0559 UTC for a depressurized duration of 6 hours 13 min.


Space Shuttle OV-103 Discovery was launched at 0147 on Dec 10 on mission
STS-116, Station flight 12A.1, using solid rocket boosters RSRM-95 and
external tank ET-123. Target orbit was 58 x 220 km x 51.6 deg; the OMS-2
burn at 0225 UTC raised this to 225 x 250 km. By Dec 11 at 1000 UTC
it was in a 298 x 347 km orbit closing in on ISS; Discovery docked
with the Station at 2212 UTC on Dec 11.

Discovery will dock with Station and install the P5 truss. During a
series of spacewalks, the crew will retract the port P6 solar array wing
(SAW-4B) and activate the truss electrical and cooling system. They will
also stow debris protection panels on the Station for installation on
the Zvezda module. After undocking, Discovery will deploy five small
satellites from launchers on the ICC cargo carrier in the payload
bay. Astronaut Sunita Williams will replace Thomas Reiter on the
long-stay Expedition 14 crew.

Below I give my usual estimated cargo manifest for the mission;
thanks especially to Kim Campbell from Spacehab for proving some
good numbers.

Ave Atque Vale
--------------

The Mars Global Surveyor probe has fallen silent after 10 years in
space, the longest operating Mars probe in history. MGS was launched in
1996 Nov, entered Mars orbit in 1997 Sep, and  after an extended
aerobraking phase began its primary mission in 1999 Mar. The last
definite signals from MGS were received at around 0h UTC on Nov 3; the
spacecraft's solar array mechanism appears to have run into problems.

Fengyun
-------

China launched its fourth Fengyun-2 ('Wind and Cloud 2') geostationary weather satellite
on Dec 8 at 0053 UTC. The Chang Zheng 3A rocket put FY-2D in geostationary
transfer orbit and the spacecraft made its FG-36 apogee motor burn at
1807 UTC the same day. The apogee motor was then probably ejected from
the spinning satellite, which carries a visible-IR radiometer.
The payload has been cataloged as 2006-53B, in a 35786 x 36478 km x 2.6 deg
geosynchronous drift orbit; the final stage is in a 226 x 36221 km x 24.9 deg
geostationary transfer orbit and is currently cataloged as 2006-53A,
although Space Command may change these designations.

Ariane 
-------

Arianespace launched Ariane 5ECA vehicle L534 from Kourou on Dec 8. This
flight V174 mission carried two communications satellites. WildBlue 1
for the WildBlue Communications broadband internet company is a Loral
1300 Ka-band satellite with a dry mass of 2000 kg and a fuelled mass of
4735 kg. The lower satellite on V174 is AMC 18 for SES Americom. This
smaller C-band cable TV distribution satellite is a Lockheed A2100A with
a dry mass of 918 kg and launch mass of 2081 kg. The EPC core stage
reached a -1282 x 233 km x 6.9 deg insertion orbit; the ESC-A upper
stage then fired to put the payloads in geostationary transfer orbit
of 265 x 35700 km x 2.0 deg.

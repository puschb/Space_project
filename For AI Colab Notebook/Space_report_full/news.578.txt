STP-1
-----

The US Air Force STP-1 mission was launched on Mar 9 at 0310 UTC on
Atlas V flight AV-013. It carries the Orbital Express mission with the
two linked satellites ASTRO (Autonomous Space Transporter and Robotic
Orbiter) and NextSat. The satellites will carry out refuelling
experiments and undocking/docking experiments. Astro/Nextsat were
deployed to a 490 x 498 km x 46.0 deg orbit. STP-1 also carried the
first ESPA (EELV Secondary Payload Adapter) ring with four smaller
satellites attached.  The US Naval Academy's Midstar-1 carries
experimental spacecraft systems and was ejected into a 494 x 498 km x
46.0 deg orbit. The Centaur stage then made two burns to raise the
orbit, entering a 397 x 3435 km x 44 deg 'fast transfer' orbit 34 min
after launch and then a 557 x 560 km x 35.4 deg orbit  13 min later. The
remaining three satellites were then deployed.

STPSat, built by AeroAstro (hi, Rick...) carries experiments to study
the Earth's atmosphere, ionosphere and radiation environment. The Los
Alamos Lab CFESat, built by Surrey Satellite (hi, lads...)  carries the
Cibola Flight Experiment to survey the radio spectrum and study the
ionosphere and lightning. Falconsat 3 is a USAF Academy student
satellite  with ionospheric experiments and plasma atttiude control
thrusters.   STPSat will also eject two small MEPSI picosatellites for
the Aerospace Corp.

Finally the Centaur stage was disposed of in a 500 x 545 km x 35.7 deg
orbit.



IGS
---

Makoto Kamada and other sources report the following information 
from Japanese newspapers:

The Optical-3 Verification satellite is an experimental satellite on a
six-month engineering mission to test out improvements to the earlier
Japanese optical spy satellites, which performed less well than hoped.
The true Optical-3 satellite will fly in 2009, followed by launch
of Radar-3 and Optical-4 in around 2011. After an initial checkout phase
by JAXA, the satellites are operated by the Cabinet Satellite
Intelligence Center (CSICE, Naikaku Eisei Joho Center) of Tokyo
via its main Kitaura Fuku Center ground station in Ibaraki prefecture.

Ariane
------

Ariane vehicle L535, flight V175 was launched on Mar 11. The EPC first
stage entered a -1251 x 157 km x 7.2 deg suborbital path; the EPS upper
stage delivered the payloads to geostationary transfer orbit.

Payloads were Skynet 5A and Insat 4B. 

Insat 4B is an ISRO communications satellite with C and Ku band
channels, and a dry mass of 1335 kg.  Insat 4B was in a 261 x  35749 km
x 4.5 deg transfer orbit.

Skynet 5A is an EADS Astrium Eurostar 3000S communications satellite
with a dry mass of 2170 kg. It is owned and operated by Paradigm Secure
Communications to provide military comms for the UK Ministry of Defence
and NATO. The first Skynet satellite was deployed in 1969 as an
outgrowth of the US Initial Defense Satellite Communications System. By
Mar 14 Skynet 5A was in a 32876 x  35734 km x 0.19 deg. 

Europe now has an extensive history of military communications satellites,
summarized below.

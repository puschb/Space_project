Erratum: ZX-6B launch date is Jul 5, not Jul 4.


Shuttle and Station
-------------------

Yurchikin, Kotov and Anderson continue the Expedition 15 mission on
board the Station.  Launch of Endeavour on mission STS-118 is scheduled
for Aug 8.

The Progress M-59 cargo ship undocked from the Pirs module on Aug 1 at 1407 UTC
and was deorbited over the Pacific at 1842 UTC. Progress M-60 remains docked
to Zvezda. Progress M-61 was launched from Baykonur at 1733 UTC on Aug 2
and reached orbit at 1742 UTC; it is scheduled to dock with the Station at
the Pirs module.

On Jul 23 Anderson and Yurchikin made a spacewalk
from the Quest airlock using EMU suits 3008 and 3006. The spacewalk
began a little before 1024 UTC and ended at 1805 UTC. A camera stand
('video stanchion') that was being stored on an FSE/FRAM (Flight Support
Equipment/Flight Releasable Attach Mechanism)  on the ESP-2 spares
pallet was retrieved and installed on the truss.  The FSE/FRAM was then
removed from ESP-2 and jettisoned overboard at 1321 UTC; the empty VSSA
FSE/FRAM is 96 kg in mass and 1.4 x 1.2 x 0.9m in size.  The ESP-2 was
launched on STS-114 and attaced to Quest on 2005 Aug 3; the VSSA FSE
carried four VSSAs, all now installed on the truss on 2005 Nov 4, 2006 Aug 3,
2007 Jun 17 and 2007 Jul 23. The second jettison during the spacewalk was that of
the Early Ammonia Servicer (EAS); it was removed from the P6 truss and
jettisoned overboard at 1437 UTC; the EAS is  2.4 x 1.1 x 1.7 meters in
size and has a mass of 640 kg. It was launched on Discovery on 2001 Aug
10 during mission STS-105, and attached to P6 on 2001 Aug 16. Also
during the spacewalk, the Node 1 nadir berthing port was cleaned in
preparation for the installation of the PMA-3 docking adapter there
later this summer.

Jens Wehrmann has kindly sent me a detailed description of the camera
positions on the truss, listed below. Some stanchions carry the ETVCG
external cameras, but some just carry WETA comm relays for wireless video
(such as the spacewalk helmet cameras) as well as UHF and S-band comm relays.
At CP2 is a stanchion carrying the Floating Potential Measurement Unit
(FPMU) which monitors electrical charging.

There is also a set of CETA lights for the spacewalk equipment carts,
near but not at CP5, installed 2003 Apr 8. Thanks Jens!


Phoenix to Mars
---------------

The first Mars Scout mission was launched at 1026 UTC on Aug 4. Phoenix
is a Mars lander mission based on the hardware from the cancelled Mars
Surveyor 2001 Lander and instruments developed for the failed Mars Polar
Lander, and is intended to land in the Martian Arctic, Vastitas
Borealis, at 68.4N 233.0E areocentric (68.6N 127.0W areographic) near
the Scandia Colles hills.

Total Phoenix mass is 680 kg including a 350 kg lander; the remaining
mass includes a cruise stage, aeroshell, backshell, parachute system
and propellant - I haven't managed to find a detailed mass breakdown.
The lander carries a robotic arm, soil analysis instruments, 
meteorology instruments, and cameras. 

Launch was by Boeing/ULA Delta 7925-9.5 from pad 17A at Cape Canaveral;
the Delta second stage burned to a 166 x 167 km x 28.5 deg parking orbit
at 0935 UTC, and again at 1140 UTC to a 163 x 5651 km x 28.5 deg
intermediate orbit. The ATK solid PAM-D (Star 48) third stage fired at
1044 UTC and shut down at 1045 UTC; at 1050 UTC two 'yo-yo' weights on
cables were deployed to despin the stage, and the stage separated from
Phoenix. The PAM-D, the two weights, and Phoenix were then on a
hyperbolic Earth escape orbit with a perigee of 195 km and an asymptotic
specific energy of C3= 29.080 km^2/s^2. Phoenix will pass lunar orbit at
0445 UTC on Aug 5 and leave the Earth's gravitational sphere of
influence early on Aug 6, into a solar orbit of 0.975 x 1.668 AU with an
ecliptic inclination of 3.4 deg. The probe is targeted for Mars arrival
on 2008 May 25; the other three objects will fly past Mars.

Cataloging
----------

The miscreant catalog number 29676 has been assigned to 2005-049F,
the MSG 2 SEVIRI baffle cover, which was previously listed with
my auxiliary catalog number A05861 in my geosync objects list.

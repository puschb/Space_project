Shuttle and Station
-------------------

The Progress M-61 cargo ship, which undocked on Dec 22, was
deorbited over the Pacific on Jan 22 after a month of free flight
carrying out the Plazma-Progress experiment.

On Jan 30, Whitson and Tani made a spacewalk to replace a motor
on the starboard truss beta gimbal and carry out further inspections
of the failed solar array alpha rotary joint.

The Progress M-63 cargo ship was launched on Feb 5 and docked with the
Pirs module on Feb 7 at 1438 UTC. Progress M-62 undocked on Feb 4 at
1032 UTC and carried out Earth observations for 10 days before being
deorbited on Feb 15 at 0944 UTC.

Space Shuttle Atlantis was launched at 1945 UTC on Feb 7 on mission
STS-122, ISS flight 1E, with the Columbus module. It reached a 58 x 230
km orbit at 1954 UTC; the OMS-2 burn at 2023 UTC raised this to 215 x
233 km. Atlantis docked with the PMA-2 port on the Station at 1717 UTC
on Feb 9.

The ESA Columbus Orbital Facility was unberthed from Atlantis at 1956
UTC on Feb 11 and bolted to the Harmony module at 2144 UTC. Astronauts
Walheim and Love made a spacewalk on Feb 11 with depressurization of
Quest at 1412 UTC and repressurization at 2212 UTC, assisting the
installation of Columbus; they removed a grapple fixture from the
payload bay at 1602 UTC and installed it on Columbus at 1659 UTC. On Feb
13 Walheim and Schlegel began a spacewalk with depress of Quest at 1421
UTC and repress at 2112 UTC; they swapped out a nitrogen tank assembly
(NTA) on the P1 truss. On Feb 15 Walheim and Love installed the SOLAR
and EUTEF experiments on the exterior of Columbus and stashed a failed
CMG (Control Moment Gyro) in the payload bay of Atlantis;
depress/repress was 1306 UTC to 2033 UTC.

Dan Tani will return to Earth on Atlantis; the new Expedition 16 crew
is NASA's Peggy Whitson, Russia's Yuriy Malenchenko and ESA's Leo Eyharts.

Kosmos numbers
--------------

Russia's Globus military communications satellite launched on
Dec 9 was originally reported with the cover name Kosmos-2434,
with the three Uragan-M satellites launched on Dec 25 getting
cover names Kosmos-2435 to 2437.

According to information from Richard Langley, the Uragan satellites are
now Kosmos-2434 to 2436 instead; we believe that the Globus satellite
has been reassigned the cover name Raduga-1 (like the other satellites
in that series). The satellites have not yet been registered with the UN
so this information is tentative; I'll keep you all posted.

USA 193
-------

The NRO's experimental USA 193 surveillance satellite, which was
reported to be crippled soon after its launch on a Delta II in Dec 2006
into a  351 x 365 km  x 58 deg orbit, is approaching reentry. Orbital
data from independent observers show that the satellite's trajectory has
slowly decayed since launch due to friction with the atmosphere; by Jan
22 it was in a 275 x 279 km x 58 deg orbit dropping about 1 km a day,
and the decrease in height will soon accelerate catastrophically. The
satellite is thought to have been intended to test prototype instruments
for future spy satellites, possibly including a radar sensor; it was
reportedly developed by Lockheed Martin (LM-Sunnyvale has experience in
recon satellites, but LM-Denver is involved in the Space Radar area;
both groups could be involved). 

Reports of 'dangerous material' on board the satellite refer to
hydrazine orbit adjust propellant; mass of the spacecraft is probably
around 2000 to 4000 kg. It's fairly rare for satellite payloads of this
mass to have an uncontrolled reentry - only one or two a year - but 
empty rocket stages as heavy as this come down about once every three
weeks. (Some reports claim this reentry is the 'second largest'
uncontrolled reentry, after Skylab. This, of course, is complete
nonsense.) The spacecraft carries about 1000 kg of hydrazine, which has
frozen; about 500 kg is expected to survive reentry as a slushy lump
giving off toxic fumes. The US government has announced plans to launch
Aegis SM-3 ballistic missile interceptors to destroy the satellite, in
the first US antisatellite test since 1986. The US Department of Defense
states that the danger of the falling hydrazine is the motivation for
this test. However, some observers suggest that the danger is not large
enough to justify such extreme measures.


TecSAR
-------

Israel's TecSAR (Polaris) experimental  radar reconnaissance satellite
was launched at 0345 UTC on Jan 21 by an Indian Polar Satellite Launch
Vehicle, flight PSLV-C10, from the First Launch Pad at Satish Dhawan
Space Centre on Sriharikota Island. At 19 min 45 s after launch the
satellite was deployed into a 469 x 585 km x 41.0 deg orbit; the PS4
final rocket stage is in a 403 x 581 km x 41.0 deg orbit. The 300 kg
satellite carries an X-band dish antenna for synthetic aperture radar
(SAR) imaging. 

PSLV-C10 was the variant of PSLV with no strapon boosters used for
light weight payloads.

Ekspress AM-33
--------------

The Ekspress AM-33 communications satellite for the Russian 
domestic satellite company Kosmicheskaya Svyaz was launched on
a Krunichev Proton-M/Briz-M on Jan 28. AM-33 is built by NPO Prikladnoi
Mekhaniki, with a communications payload developed by Thales Alenia.
It has a mass of 2540 kg. The spacecraft entered a 405 x 35550 km x 46.2 deg
transfer orbit before being placed in geosynchronous orbit; an object
tracked in that orbit is probably the Briz DTB propellant tank.

Thor 5
------

Telenor's Ku-band Thor 5 satellite was launched on Feb 11 by a Proton-M/Briz-M
from Baykonur. The satellite is an Orbital Star-2 light geostationary spacecraft.
Telenor Satellite Broadcasting is a Norwegian satellite company.

Rascom
------

The RASCOM-QAF-1 satellite has now reached geostationary orbit at 2.8 deg E,
after a month-long delay due to propulsion system difficulties.

Iranian rocket
--------------

On Feb 4 the Islamic Republic of Iran held a ceremony to inaugurate a
space launch center as part of a program to develop a satellite launch
vehicle, and launched a suborbital rocket. The Iranian news agency
IRNA says in its English language version:

 "The president said the launch of the first space research unit would be
great stride to serve the mankind and would lead to Iran's exaltation
and progress.
 He inaugurated Iran's first space terminal this morning."

I interpret "space terminal" as meaning "launch site", and "space research unit"
as meaning "research rocket". But any Persian-speaking readers who have read the
reports in their original language are encouraged to send clarifications.

According to most of the reports, the rocket is called Kavoshgar-1
('Explorer' or 'Researcher'); an Israeli news report calls the rocket
Safir-1 ('Emissary'), and a photograph of a (possibly the) rocket
has the Safir name written on the side, together with "IRILV", which
presumably stands for "Islamic Republic of Iran Launch Vehicle".
It may be that the photo is a mockup of the satellite launch version,
and Kavoshgar is the rocket or mission name for the suborbital version.

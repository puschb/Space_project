Shuttle and Station
-------------------

Endeavour landed on Mar 27 after a successful STS-123 mission.

On Mar 15 Linnehan and Foreman carried out the second spacewalk of the
flight, leaving the Quest airlock with depressurization at 2343 UTC,
hatch open at about 2348 UTC and egress just after 0000 UTC on Mar 16.
During the spacewalk they assembled the Dextre robot manipulator, in its
Spacelab pallet attached to the Station truss. Quest was repressurized
at 0657 UTC following hatch closure at 0654. On Mar 17 Behnken and
Linnehan performed EVA-3, depressurizing Quest at 2246 UTC and opening
the hatch at 2251. They completed assembly of Dextre, installed the
LWAPA adapter plate on the External Payload Facility of Columbus,
and transferred spare equipment from Endeavour's payload bay to 
External Stowage Platform 2. However, attempts to install the MISSE 6
sample exposure experiment on the LWAPA were not successful on this EVA;
this was eventually completed on EVA 5.

On Mar 20 Behnken and Foreman made another spacewalk, with depressurization
to 0.7 psi  by 2159 UTC and hatch open at 2203 UTC. They replaced a
power control box on the truss and carried out the T-RAD experiment to
repair sample damaged heat shield tiles using a putty-like material.
Hatch closed at 0425 UTC and repress at 0428 UTC.
Behnken and Foreman made EVA-5 from 2030 UTC Mar 22 to 0236 UTC Mar 23
(depress/repress; 2034 to 0231 hatch open/close). They helped install
the OBSS arm, used to inspect the underside of the Shuttle, on the
Station truss. It will be left there until STS-124, since that mission
can't fit the OBSS in its payload bay. They also made further inspections
of the damaged SARJ (Solar Alpha Rotary Joint).

Endeavour undocked at 0025 UTC on Mar 25, leaving Garrett Reisman aboard
the station with Whitson and Malenchenko. After a flyaround completed at
0136 UTC they prepared for reentry, with deorbit at 2333 UTC on Mar 26
and landing at 0039 UTC on Mar 27, touching down on Runway 15 at
Kennedy Space Center.


AMC 14
------

The Russian federal space agency reports that AMC 14's Briz M stage
second burn was short by 2 min 13s. On Mar 16 it was in a 770 x 26447 km
x 49.2 deg orbit. 

AMC 14's orbit is now being raised; on Mar 20 the satellite was moved to
a 767 x 32333 km x 49.1 deg orbit and on Mar 21  to a 772 x 35576 km x
49.0 deg orbit. 

AMC 14 had a total mass at launch of 4140 kg of which 2130 kg was
propellant; a rough calculation suggests that reaching geostationary
orbit will be difficult.


DirecTV
-------

Sea Launch fired a Zenit-3SL from the Odyssey platform in the Pacific
on Mar 19. The payload was a television satellite for DirecTV.
The satellite reached a 267 x 36473 km x 0.1 deg transfer orbit.


GPS
---

A Boeing Delta 2 was launched at 0610 UTC on Mar 15 carrying a
Navstar GPS navigation satellite, SVN 48 (IIR-19/M6). The second
stage first cutoff was at 0620 UTC in a 174 x 205 km orbit.
The GPS satellite was delivered to a 188 x 20325 km x 40.0 deg transfer
orbit. GPS SVN 48 fired its apogee motor at about 0921 UTC on Mar 17,
reaching a 20134 x 20152 km x 55.1 deg orbit.

SAR-Lupe 4
----------

Germany's fourth SAR-Lupe radar recon satellite was launched
on Mar 27 by a Russian Kosmos-3M from Plesetsk into a 470 x 508 x 98.2 deg
orbit.

 On 2008 Mar 28.0 the orbits of the four satellites were:
 SAR-Lupe 1   2006 Dec 19   466 x 501 x 98.1  NodeRA = 204 deg
 SAR-Lupe 2   2007 Jul  2   472 x 496 x 98.2  NodeRA = 304 deg
 SAR-Lupe 3   2007 Nov  1   473 x 494 x 98.2  NodeRA = 142 deg
 SAR-Lupe 4   2008 Mar 27   470 x 508 x 98.2  NodeRA = 334 deg


The Mystery of 1971-00E - progress
----------------------------------

Mike Waterman and TS Kelso have kindly sent me element sets for 1971-00E
(5310) which I have converted to pseudo TLE format at 
http://www.planet4589.org/space/elements/05300/S05310 They show that the
object was drifting slowly over the Pacific in 1973-1974 and that its
elements are identical with those archived for the Tacsat 1 satellite
(03691, 1969-13A).

USA 200
-------

The USA 200 satellite has been found by independent observers in
a 1112 x 37580 km x 63.6 deg orbit.

Errata
-------

The forward pallet on Spacelab 2 was F004, not F002. Information
from Robert Pearlman, quoting Scott Higginbotham, suggests that
F004 was renamed MD002 and was used on STS-100 and STS-123.


Friend of JSR Pete Young points out that the Space Test Program
is a Dept. of Defense program, not a USAF program, although it is
managed by USAF. I thank him for drawing this fine distinction.

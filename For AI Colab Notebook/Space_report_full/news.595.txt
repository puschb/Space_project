Shuttle and Station
-------------------

Endeavour landed on Mar 27 after a successful STS-123 mission.
Progress M-63 undocked from Pirs at 0849 UTC on Apr 7 and was
deorbited over the Pacific later the same day.

Soyuz TMA-12 was launched on Apr 8. Aboard are the EO-17 crew of Sergey
Aleksandrovich Volkov, Oleg Dmitreevich Kononenko, and the EP-14 crew
consisting of Dr. Yi Soyeon of South Korea's KAIST (formerly the Korea Advanced
Inst. of Science and Technology). Volkov is the son of former cosmonaut
Aleksandr Volkov. Dr. Yi is flying as a 'spaceflight participant'
(uchastnik kosmicheskovo poleta) under the Korean Astronaut Program,
managed by Korea's KARI space agency. KARI is the Korea Aerospace
Research Institute (Han-guk Hanggong Uju Yeon-guwon), based in Daejeon.

TMA-12 docked at the Pirs module on 2008 Apr 10  at 1257 UTC.
Malenchenko, Whitson and Yi undocked from the Zarya module aboard Soyuz
TMA-11 at 0506 UTC on Apr 19. The deorbit burn was at 0740 UTC and
following an anomalous (partly ballistic) reentry they landed in
Kazakstan 470 km short of the target point at around 0829 UTC. There may
have been a separation problem between the descent and propulsion
modules. According to the Novosti Kosmonavtiki forum the actual landing
site was at 50 31 N 61 07E. Volkov, Kononenko and Garrett Reisman 
remain on board ISS; the Jules Verne ATV remains docked at the Zvezda
port.


AMC 14
-------

SES has announced that AMC 14 is to be declared a total loss. It
currently remains in a 778 x 35570 km x 49.0 deg orbit, with its future
unclear.

Erratum

Russell Eberst pointed out that I messed up the orbital planes for
the SAR-Lupe satellites in JSR 594.
Here are the correct values for 2008 Mar 28:

 SAR-Lupe 1   2006 Dec 19   466 x 501 x 98.1  NodeRA = 143 deg 
 SAR-Lupe 2   2007 Jul  2   472 x 496 x 98.2  NodeRA = 208 deg 
 SAR-Lupe 3   2007 Nov  1   473 x 494 x 98.2  NodeRA = 272 deg
 SAR-Lupe 4   2008 Mar 27   470 x 508 x 98.2  NodeRA = 143 deg

So, the satellites are spaced about 65 deg apart and the new satellite
SAR-Lupe 4 is in the same plane as the first one.


ICO G1
------

The ICO G1 satellite was launched by a Lockheed Martin Atlas 5 model 421
(serial AV-014) on Apr 14. The satellite is a Loral 1300 with a launch
mass of 6600 kg and will provide mobile communications services for ICO
Global Communications (Holdings) Ltd based in Reston, Virginia. ICO is a
successor company to Teledesic and to the old ICO Global Communications
of London, which lost one satellite to a launch failure in 2000. ICO
launched a second Hughes satellite in 2001 to a medium altitude orbit,
and keeps ten more in storage. Meanwhile, ICO is switching to a more
conventional geostationary service; the new G1 satellite was in a 35772
x 35836 km x 6.0 deg geostationary drift orbit on Apr 25.

C/NOFS
------

The DoD Space Test Program's P00-3 space weather forecasting mission,
C/NOFS (Communication/Navigation Outage Forecasting System) was launched
by an Orbital Sciences Pegasus on Apr 16. The L-1011 carrier plane took
off from Kwajalein atoll in the Pacific. Planned orbit was 375 x 720 km
x 13 deg. C/NOFS is a research satellite carring ionospheric
instruments, including the Aerospace Corp.'s CORISS receiver which uses
GPS signals to determine electron densities in the ionosphere, and NRL's
CERTO ionospheric radio beacon. The spacecraft was built by General
Dynamics C4 Systems (former Spectrum Astro) and is managed by DoD-STP
and AFRL (the Air Force Research Lab). It will forecast ionospheric
scintillation which causes problems with communications and GPS signals;
the satellite will deploy six 10-meter booms.

The one previous Pegasus launch from Kwajalein used a launch vehicle
drop point of 167.7E 7.65N. I don't have any information about the drop
point for this mission, and an accurate launch time has not been
released.

Star One/Vinasat
----------------

Another Arianespace launch with Ariane 5ECA serial number 539 placed two
communications satellites in orbit. The EPC core stage reached a -1405 x
211 km x 7.4 deg sub-orbit, and the ESC-A upper stage delivered the
payloads to a 272 x 35677 x 2.0 deg transfer orbit, a record low
inclination for an Ariane launch. The upper payload is Star One C2, for
the Brazilian operator Star One. Star One C2 has C, Ku and X-band
transponders and was built by Thales (Cannes) using the Spacebus 3000B3
bus. The lower payload is Vinasat 1, the first satellite owned by
Vietnam. The VNPT (Vietnam Post and Telecom Corp) satellite is an A2100
built by Lockheed Martin (Newton) with C and Ku band payloads.
Vinasat 1 is currently being tracked as object D (32770) but will
probably be redesignated soon. Star One C2 may be object C (32769).

Tian Lian 1
------------

China's first Tian Lian data relay satellite was launched on Apr 25 into
a 218 x 41817 km x 18.1 deg transfer orbit. The launch vehicle was the
CZ-3C, a new variant of the CZ-3A series with 2 strapons (compared to
the basic CZ-3A with no strapons and the heavy CZ-3B with 4 strapons).

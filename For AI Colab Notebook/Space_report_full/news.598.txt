STS-125 (Hubble Servicing Mission 4)
------------------------------------

Preparations for launch of Atlantis to refurbish the Hubble Space
Telescope are advancing. External Tank ET-127 and solid boosters
RSRM-103 (stack BI-135) are assembled in Vehicle Assembly Building High
Bay 3. Orbiter 104 (Atlantis) is in Orbiter Processing Facility bay 1.
Atlantis will carry the SLIC (Super Lightweight Interchangeable
Carrier), with Wide Field Camera 3 , batteries and a
radiator; the ORU Carrier with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph and FGS-3R
instruments; the FSS (Flight Support Structure) for berthing HST, and
the MULE (Multi-Use Lightweight Equipment carrier, for support equipment).


Ariane 5ECA
------------

Ariane 5 vehicle L541, flight V184 was launched from Kourou on
Jul 7. It carried Protostar 1 and Badr 6 into orbit.

Protostar 1 is an SS/Loral LS-1300 satellite with a mass of 1774 kg
dry 4191 kg fuelled. It is owned by Protostar Ltd. of Bermuda and
its subsidiary Protostar Satellite Systems of San Francisco. I believe
the launch contract is with the US subsidiary, and I am therefore counting
Protostar as a US satellite (I imagine the Bermuda address is just
for some kind of tax reason).

Badr 6 is an Astrium Eurostar 2000+ satellite for Arabsat of Riyadh;
it is also known as Arabsat 4AR, and replaces Arabsat 4A which was lost
in a 2006 Proton launch failure.

Falcon 1
--------

Falcon 1 flight 003 was launched from Omelek Island at 0334 UTC on Aug
3, but two minutes after launch the mission failed.  According to information
released by SpaceX, the problem occurred when stage 1 failed to separate
from stage 2. The improved Merlin 1C first stage engine 
completed its burn successfully, but a longer than expected first stage
shutdown meant that the stage was still thrusting when stage 2 tried to
separate, and the two stages briefly recontacted.
The stages fell in the Pacific; SpaceX boss Elon Musk reports that
the first stage reached 217 km altitude, the second stage ignited
correctly, and the fairing separated - which was due to happen at 3min 13s 
after launch, implying that the stage
remained intact at that point. Musk was reported by spaceflightnow.com
as saying that 'Neither stage exploded. They just got a little bit cooked.'
Presumably the recontact caused the second stage to tumble during 
the burn.

The rocket carried the 83 kg Trailblazer satellite, a test of a new
SpaceDev bus as part of the DoD's Operationally Responsive Space
program. Two 3 kg nanosatellites from NASA Ames Research Center were
also aboard, and two Celestis burial capsules containing cremated remains
were attached to the second stage.

Echostar 11
-----------

The Echostar 11 satellite was launched on Jul 16 by a Sea Launch Zenit-3SL.
The satellite will provide television broadcasting for the Dish Network.
By Jul 24 it was in a 35685 x 35791 km x 0.1 deg orbit drifting over 140W.

SAR-Lupe 5
-----------

Germany's fifth SAR-Lupe radar satellite was launched by a Russian
Kosmos-3M on Jul 22 into a 470 x 500 km x 98.1 deg orbit.

Kosmos-2440
------------

According to correspondents on the nasaspaceflight.com site,
the upper stage used to launch Kosmos-2440 was an old 11S861 Blok DM-2,
redesignated DM-3 (or DM3) for reasons that are unclear.

Kosmos-2441
-----------

Kosmos-2441 was launched from Plesetsk on Jul 26 by a three-stage
Soyuz-2-1b rocket into a 195 x 726 x 98.3 deg orbit. It is believed to
be the first in a new series of Russian military imaging recon
satellites, reportedly designated Persona. On Jul 31 the orbit
was raised to 714 x 732 km.

Erratum
--------

Carl Rigg points out that the Zhongxing 9 (Chinasat 9) launch was
Jun 9, not Jun 10.

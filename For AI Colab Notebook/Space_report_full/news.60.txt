----------------------------------------------------
STS-38/Atlantis was launched on Nov 15 and reportedly deployed the
AFP-658 recon satellite into a 28 degree inclination orbit.  Atlantis
landed at the Kennedy Space Center on Nov 20. 

STS-35/Columbia is due for launch in early December.
Crew are Vance Brand, commander; Guy Gardner, pilot; 
Mike Lounge, Dr. Jeffrey Hoffman, Dr. Robert Parker, mission
specialists; Dr. Ron Parise and Dr. Sam Durrance, payload
specialists. This will be the last spaceflight by an Apollo astronaut;
Brand first flew on the last Apollo mission, the 1975 Apollo-Soyuz flight.

The EO-5 (5th long stay) crew, Gennadiy Manakov and Gennadiy Strekalov
continue in orbit aboard the Mir/Kvant/Kvant-2/Kristall/Soyuz TM-10/
Progress M-5 complex.  Soyuz TM-11 is due for launch on Dec 2, carrying
the replacement EO-6 crew, Viktor Afanas'ev of the Soviet Air Force and
Musa Manarov of NPO Energiya (the organization that operates the
civilian cosmonaut team).  The third seat will be filled by passenger
Toyohiro Akiyama of the Tokyo Broadcasting System, who will return with
the EO-5 crew on board Soyuz TM-7. 

Kosmos-2103 was launched on Nov 14 by a two-stage version of the
Tsiklon from Baykonur, It is a Soviet Naval Intelligence ferret
satellite which listens to the electronic emissions from ships;
it is in a 400 km circular orbit at 65 degrees to the equator.

Kosmos-2104 was launched on Nov 16 by Soyuz from Plesetsk. It is
a GRU (Soviet military intelligence) imaging recon satellite.

Kosmos-2105 was launched on Nov 20 by Molniya from Plesetsk.  It is a
PVO (Soviet Air Defence Command) missile early warning satellite in a
600x39300 km x 63 degree orbit. 

Two US comsats, Satcom C1 and GSTAR 4, were launched by Ariane 42P on
Nov 20.  Satcom C1 is a C-band (6/4 GHz) cable TV relay satellite
operated by GE American Communications (formerly RCA Americom).  GSTAR 4
is operated by GTE Spacenet as part of its Ku-band (14/12 GHz)
communications network. Both satellites were built by GE Astro Space.

--- Hubble Space Telescope update ----

At a workshop at the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) on Nov
16, HST observers and STScI staff started to revise the telescope's
observing program.  The Orbital Verification period is now essentially
complete and Science Verification is beginning (lots of calibration
observations and test exposures).  Proper scheduled observing will begin
around July '91.  Contrary to initial expectations, it seems to me that
programs using the cameras are in better shape than the spectrographs. 
Because of the aberration, HST can't see extremely faint objects, or
moderately faint objects which are right next to rather bright ones
(they get lost in the fuzzed out image of the bright one, and if the
brightness of your faint object is comparable to the uncertainty in the
shape of the point spread function of the bright object, no amount of
deconvolution will help you).  But it can do very good imaging of groups
of bright objects very close to one another, like the R136 cluster, or,
with some extra observing time, of a point source on a diffuse
background (like the core of NGC 7457).  Deconvolution techniques seem
to work pretty well; relative to radio astronomy, you have a a much
better sampled point spread function, but it varies in shape from one
part of the detector to another in nasty ways, so it's not an easy task. 
FOC seems to be working really well and will get nice UV pictures.  The
spectrographs, however, have the problem that because of the fuzzed out
images, not all the light goes down the spectrograph slit.  If you can
open up the aperture to let more light in, that's no problem, but that
can lose spectral resolution or let in light from a nearby object.  If
that's a problem for you, you're stuck with integrating for 5 times as
long, and the time reallocation committee is going to take a lot of
convincing. The Faint Object Spectrograph itself seems to be working
fine except for substandard shielding against the Earth's magnetic field,
but that shouldn't be too bad for most programs. The telescope's
pointing software and the solar array jitter are still giving problems,
but in a few months things should improve enough for most purposes.
All in all my impression is that while the telescope is not what it
might have been, and some of the key projects (particularly the distance
scale) are dead in the water until the repair mission, most observer's
projects really can still be done without too much loss of science - I'm much
more optimistic than I was a month or so ago.

Shuttle and Station
--------------------

The Expedition 18 crew of Michael Fincke, Yuiry Lonchakov and Greg
Chamitoff continued work on board ISS until the arrival of STS-126;
after its departure and return to Earth with Chamitoff, Expedition 18
consists of Fincke, Lonchakov, and NASA's Sandy Magnus.

Soyuz TMA-13 is docked to the Zarya port. Progress M-65 undocked from
Zvezda at 1620 UTC on Nov 14, and remained in orbit until Dec 7 to
continue ionospheric experiments. Progress M-01M was
launched on Nov 26; the new spacecraft, serial no. 401, has a modernized
digital control system. It docked with the Pirs module on Nov 30.

Endeavour entered in a 158 x 230 km orbit following launch on Nov 15 on
mission STS-126,  and docked with the PMA-2 unit on the Harmony module
at 2201 UTC on Nov 16.

At 1709 UTC on Nov 17 the ISS robot arm (SSRMS) unberthed the MPLM-1 Leonardo
module from Endeavour's bay and by 1804 UTC it was attached to the Harmony
module nadir port.

On Nov 18, Heidi Stefanyshyn-Piper and Steve Bowen made a spacewalk from
the Quest module using EMU suits 3005 and 3003. Quest reached 50 mbar at
around 1805 UTC, and the hatch was opened around 1808 UTC. The
astronauts transferred an empty airlock nitrogen tank from the ESP-3
stowage pallet on the Station to the LMC carrier in Endeavour, and
brought back to ESP-3 a new spare part, the Flexible Hose Rotary
Coupler. They then began the major outdoor work of the mission, the
cleaning and maintenance of the Solar Array Rotary Joint (SARJ) on the
S3 truss segment. Trundle Bearing Assembly units were replaced and the
SARJ 'race ring' was lubricated. At 2038 UTC Stefanyshyn-Piper's 14 kg
tool bag accidentally floated away; the work continued with spare tools.
The astronauts returned to the airlock around 0050 UTC on Nov 19, with
hatch closed at 0057 UTC and repressurization at 0101 UTC. The crew lock
bag was cataloged as object 33442, 1998-067BL, and is in a 348 x 353 km
orbit. One other ISS debris object is still aloft, a jettisoned thruster
cover from EVA-20A on 2008 Jul 11; its orbit is 309 x 320 km.

EVA-2 was on Nov 20 by Stefanyshyn-Piper at Kimbrough, wearing EMU suits
3005 and 3018. They moved the two CETA equipment carts from the starboard
to the port side of the Mobile Transporter, and carried out more SARJ
maintenance. Depressurization to 50 mbar was at 1752 UTC and
the hatch was open at 1757 UTC; hatch was closed at 0039 UTC on Nov 21
with repressurization at 0042 UTC.

The third spacewalk was on Nov 22 by Bowen and Stefanyshyn-Piper,
wearing suits 3003 and 3005. Quest reached 50 mbar at about 1758 UTC
with hatch open at 1800 UTC. The astronauts continued servicing the SARJ.
Hatch was closed at 0052 UTC on Nov 23 with repressurization beginning
at 0058 UTC.

EVA-4 was on Nov 24; Kimbrough and Bowen completed the SARJ work
and installed an external TV camera and a GPS antenna to support
docking of JAXA's HTV cargo ship. Airlock depress was around 1819 UTC
with hatch open at 1822 UTC; hatch close at 0029 UTC on Nov 25
with repressurization at 0031 UTC.

On Nov 26 the Leonardo module was returned from Harmony to Endeavour.
Endeavour undocked at 1447 UTC on Nov 28. At 2033 UTC
on Nov 29, the 7 kg PicoSat Solar Cell Testbed Experiment, PSSC Testbed,
was deployed. It is a pathfinder for a later PSSC mission to geostationary
transfer orbit to study radiation degradation of solar cells.

On Nov 29 at 2019 UTC Endeavour fired its OMS engines to reduce velocity
by 89 m/s, putting it on a reentry path. The Shuttle landed on temporary
runway 04L at Edwards AFB in California at 2125 UTC. (The main runway 04R/22L
is being refurbished, and a new, shorter temporary runway is in place
as 04L/22R.) On Dec 10 Endeavour began its trek back to Florida atop
Shuttle Carrier Aircraft NASA 911.


Kosmos-2445
-----------

Kosmos-2445 raised its orbit to 194 x 347 km on Nov 17.

Yaogan Weixing si hao
---------------------

The YW 4 satellite (Remote Sensing Satellite No. 4) was launched from
China's northern Jiuquan space center on Dec 1 into a 633 x 652 km x
97.9 deg orbit. As for YW 2, no launch vehicle stage was cataloged; it
seems  probable that the CZ-2D second stage makes a depletion burn after
payload separation and reenters within a few orbits.


Kosmos-2446
------------

The Russian Defense Ministry launched an Oko (US-KS) elliptical orbit
early warning satellite on Dec 2; it was given the cover name Kosmos-2446.

Ciel-2
------

A Proton was launched from Baykonur on Dec 10 into a -497 x 175 km x 51.5
deg orbit. The Briz-M upper stage then reached orbits of
184 x 184 km, 277 x 5007 km, 334 x 16721 km, 421 x 35621 km and, after
an inclination change to 19.5 deg, 5580 x 35612 km, where the Ciel-2
payload separated.

Ciel-2 is a Thales Alenia Spacebus 4000C4 with a mass of around 5600 kg,
owned by Ciel Satellite Group, an Ottawa-based satellite TV operator.
Ciel is currently using Echostar V. Control of Ciel-2 will be from
Saskatoon, Saskatchewan.

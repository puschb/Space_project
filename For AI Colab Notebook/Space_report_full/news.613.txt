Shuttle and Station
--------------------

Gennadiy Padalka (Commander, Russia), Mike Barratt (Flight Engineer 1,
NASA), Koichi Wakata (FE2, Japan-JAXA), Roman Romanenko (FE3, Russia),
Frank DeWinne (FE4, European Space Agency) and Bob Thirsk (FE5, Canadian
Space Agency) are aboard the station as Expedition 20. Soyuz TMA-15 and
Soyuz TMA-14 are also docked to the Station.

The Progress M-02M cargo ship undocked at 1820 UTC on Jun 30. Padalka,
Barratt and Wakata boarded TMA-14 on Jul 2 and undocked from the Zvezda
aft port at 2129 UTC, redocking at Pirs at 2155 UTC. Soyuz TMA-15 is
docked at Zarya nadir.

On Jul 12 at around 1600 UTC Progress M-02M returned to the Station
and carried out a close approach to the newly active zenith docking port
on Zvezda to test the rendezvous equipment installed on the port in
recent spacewalks. Progress M-02M approached to a distance of about 10m 
at 1707 UTC and then returned to an independent orbit. The next day,
at 1543 UTC on Jul 13, the cargo ship fired its engines to reenter
over the southern Pacific Ocean.

Space Shuttle Endeavour was launched from Kennedy Space Center on Jul 15,
carrying the Kibo Exposed Facility and the Kibo ELM Exposed Section.
The flight is Shuttle mission STS-127, Station mission 2J/A.
Launch was at 2203 UTC; at 2211 UTC, Endeavour and external tank ET-131
reached a 58 x 230 km x 51.6 deg orbit. At 2241 UTC Endeavour
fired its engines to raise its orbit to 155 x 232 km x 51.6 deg.

Crew of Endeavour are Mark Polansky, Doug Hurley, Dave Wolf, Chris
Cassidy, Julie Payette, Tom Marshburn and Tim Kopra. Kopra will join the
Ex 20 crew on ISS, replacing Wakata.

The Kibo Exposed Facility and Experiment Logistics Module (Exposed
Section) will be addeed to the Station. On the ELM-ES the  Japanese MAXI
(Monitor of All Sky X-ray Image) experiment will be installed, which
should replace the aging Rossi XTE All Sky Monitor as an early warning
system for flaring X-ray sources.

LRO and LCROSS
--------------

LRO, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter,
 entered a 220 x 3100 km x 90 deg lunar orbit on Jun 23. The four 80N
thrusters burned from 0947 to 1026 UTC. On Jun 24 at 1056 UTC a 12 min
LOI-2 burn reduced the orbit to 200 x 1680 km; at 1032 UTC on Jun 25
LOI-3 sent LRO to a 199 x 740 km x 89.93 deg path; and LOI-4 at 1225 on
Jun 26 resulted in a roughly 200 x 200 km orbit. On Jun 27 it entered
the commissioning orbit of 31 x 209 km x 90.5 deg, and its first high
resolution images of the lunar surface are now being returned. By Aug 3,
when the commissioning orbit will have been perturbed to 43 x 197 km x
89.7 deg,  LRO will be ready to go lower, entering an orbit which ranges
from 47 x 53 km at its most circular to 35 x 66 km at its most
elliptical.

LCROSS flew 3270 km from the Moon at 1030 UTC on Jun 23 and now
is in an orbit that will take it out to 582000 km from the Earth.
It will impact the Moon in October.


USA 193
-------

It had been thought that all the debris from the USA 193 satellite,
destroyed by an Aegis SM-3 missile on 2008 Feb 21, had reentered.
However during a routine update of debris found in orbit, a new
piece of the satellite has been found in a 234 x 934 km x 56.1 deg
orbit and cataloged as 2006-057GH.

GOES 14
------

A new Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite is in orbit. The
GOES satellites provide wide-area weather imaging and solar flare
monitoring. GOES O, which became GOES 14 after reaching geostationary
orbit on Jul 9, went up on a Delta 4 Medium+ variant with a 4-meter
fairing and two strap-on solid boosters. The three Delta burns put it
sucessively in 187 x 554 km x 28.5 deg, 268 x 34603 km x 26.6 deg, and
6634 x 35155 km x 12.0 deg orbits. The on-board R-4D apogee engine
raised the orbit to geostationary. GOES O is a 601 class satellite built
by Boeing (El Segundo). Early orbit checkout is done by NASA Goddard,
and then it will be controlled by the NOAA satellite center in Suitland,
Maryland.

Sirius FM5
----------

Sirius XM Radio's FM5 satellite was launched on Jun 30 from Baykonur.
The Loral 1300-class satellite with a launch mass of 5976 kg and a dry
mass of 2900 kg flew aboard an ILS/Krunichev Proton-M/Briz-M. The Proton
reached a suborbital trajectory (unusually, the coopi.khrunichev.ru site
did not give the parameters, which were probably around -750 x 150 km x
51.6 deg) and separated from Briz. The Briz burns reached 179 x 179 km x
51.6 deg, 270 x 5000 km x 50.3 deg, 325 x 14534 km x 49.6 deg, 425 x
35818 x 49.2 deg and 4201 x 35975 km x 23.0 deg. The Briz propellant
tank was jettisoned into the third orbit of this sequence. Briz
separated from Sirius FM5 at 0423 UTC on Jul 1. By Jul 13 FM5
was drifting past 96 deg W in a 35773 x 35781 km x 0.1 deg orbit.

Terrestar 1
-----------

The second launch of a Loral 1300 satellite in two days was the most
massive communications satellite to date, the 6910 kg Terrestar 1,
which carries an 18-meter deployable antenna for S-band mobile communications.
Ariane 5ECA vehicle 547 reached an initial -1159 x 176 km x 11.8 deg
trajectory and then a 235 x 35901 km x 6.0 deg transfer orbit.
(The suborbital part of the trajectory, quoted in the EADS press kit,
has an unusually high inclination for a Kourou launch and may be a typo).
Terrestar Networks is based in Reston, Virginia.

The histories of Terrestar Corp, its subsidiary Terrestar Networks, and
the related L-band companies SkyTerra Communications and SkyTerra LP are
very tangled. As far as I understand it - which is not very far - it
goes like this:

1995-1996: AMSC (American Mobile Satellite Co) launched AMSC-1, and TMI (Telesat
           Mobile, Canada) launched M-SAT 1, two similar L-band M-SAT satellites.
2000:      AMSC becomes Motient
2001:      Motient and TMI spin off MSV (Mobile Satellite Ventures) as a
           joint venture to operate the M-SATs
2001?      Motient creates Terrestar Networks to build S-band system,
            with other investors.
2003?:     SkyTerra Communications (SkyTC) is an 
           investor in MSV and to some extent in Terrestar.
2006:      Big ownership swap.
           - MSV becomes a subsidiary of SkyTC
           - Terrestar Networks becomes a subsidiary of Motient
2007:      Motient renamed Terrestar Corp.
2008:      MSV renamed SkyTerra LP, planning launch of SkyTerra 1 and 2.

DICE
----

The University of Colorado's suborbital Diffuse Interstellar Cloud
Experiment was launched from White Sands on Jun 29. DICE, flown on Black
Brant 9 rocket flight NASA 36.244UG, carried a high-resolution far
ultraviolet spectrograph intended to study the O VI line along two lines
of sight towards Sco.

Kosmos-2450
-----------

Russia's Kobal't-M class spy satellite, Kosmos-2450, had been in orbit
for 65 days on Jul 3, when it was in a 177 x 325 km x 67.1 deg orbit.
Typical lifetimes for this time of satellite range from 75 to 120 days.
In an unusual maneuver, on Jun 7 at 2332 UTC Kosmos-2450 raised its
orbit from 181 x 325 km to 247 x 381 km and then 26.5 hours later
lowered it again to 178 x 357 km, presumably shifting the ground track
to cover a different set of targets. Regular orbit raising burns were
carried out on May 2, May 14, May 27 and Jun 21.

Kosmos-2451/2452/2453
---------------------

Three military communications satellites were launched from Plesetsk by
a Rokot launch vehicle on  Jul 6. According to Bob Christy, at least two
of them are of the Strela-3 type, based on their radio transmissions.
Rokot is a converted UR-100N two-stage missile with a Briz-KM third
stage. The Kosmos satellites were inserted into a 1500 x 1505 km x 82.5
deg orbit; the Briz-KM then lowered itself to a 1204 x 1504 km orbit.
The satellites have a mass of around 225 kg each.

Razaksat
--------

The Malaysian RazakSat imaging satellite was launched from Omelek Island
in the Pacific by SpaceX's Falcon 1 rocket on Jul 14 at 0336 UTC. 
By 0345 UTC RazakSat, attached to the Falcon 1 second stage, was
in parking orbit, probably around 200 x 685 km. The second burn at 0424
UTC was followed by separation of the satellite into an orbit of 665 x
688 km x 9.0 deg. The second stage ended up in a slightly lower
616 x 687 x 9.1 deg orbit.

Shuttle and Station
--------------------

On Aug 7 the Station SSRMS arm grappled the PMA3 docking port 
and removed it from the Unity module's nadir berth at around 1000 UTC.
At around 1200 UTC the PMA3 was attached to Unity's port berth,
leaving the nadir berth free for a new module.

OV-103 Discovery was launched on Aug 29 on mission STS-128.
It carries Multipurpose Logistics Module FM-1 - the MPLM 'Leonardo' -
and other cargo carriers.

Discovery docked with Station at 0054 UTC on Aug 31 and undocked at 1926
UTC on Sep 8. During the mission, the Leonardo module was attached to
the nadir port on the Harmony node (from Aug 31 2135 to Sep 8 0001) and
experiments and equipment were transferred to the Station from it,
including the Combined Operational Load  Bearing External Resistance
Treadmill (COLBERT), a crew quarters rack, materials science and fluids
experiment racks, and a freezer system.

During three spacewalks the EUTEF and MISSE 6 experiments were
retrieved from Columbus, an ammonia tank assembly (ATA) was replaced
on the P1 truss, and the S3 payload attach system was deployed.
Cables were laid along the station in preparation for activating
the Tranquility node when it arrives, although one cable could not
be properly connected.

Spacewalk details were as follows:
                           EMUs         Depr. H.Open OnBat     H.Close Repress
EVA-1 Olivas, Stott     3015,3005 Sep 1 2144? 2148  2149  Sep 2 0419    0424

EVA-3 Olivas, Fuglesang 3015,3009 Sep 5 2035? 2038  2039  Sep 6 0334    0340

EMU 3005 will be returned to Earth aboard Discovery (it was launched on STS-126);
EMU 3009 replaces it on the Station.

A small object was released from the payload bay at some point during
EVA-3; Discovery made an orbit adjust burn on Sep 10 to avoid it.
The object was cataloged as 1998-067BV. Another small object
floated out of the payload bay on Sep 9; it has not been cataloged.

The Japanese H-II Transfer Vehicle, HTV-1, was launched on Sep 10.


STSAT-2/Naro-1
--------------

The first launch of South Korea's KSLV-1 'Naro' rocket ended in failure
with the reentry of the STSAT-2 satellite payload over the Pacific.
Early reports suggest that the Russian-built Angara first stage operated
correctly, and the Korean solid-motor second stage also fired, but half
of the payload fairing failed to separate. STSAT-2 reached 387 km in
altitude, but the extra mass of the fairing prevented  the system from
reaching orbital velocity. The orbit was around -3100 x 387 km x 80 deg,
and reentry was probably somewhere over New Guinea.

Asiasat 5
---------

An ILS/Khrunichev Proton-M launched the Loral-1300-class Asiasat 5
satellite on Aug 11. Asiasat 5 is owned by Asiasat, a Hong Kong based
company, and provides C-band and Ku-band communications services.

GPS 50
------

The final Block IIR-M Global Positioning System satellite, space vehicle
number SVN 50, was launched from Cape Canaveral on Aug 17.
It is the 21st IIR launch, and will replace a Block IIA series
satellite. The Delta II launch vehicle passed through
intermediate orbits of 174 x 206 km x 37.5 deg and 191 x 1241 km x 38.0 deg
to reach a (planned) 188 x 20256 km x 40.1 deg transfer orbit.
GPS SVN 50 will fire its ATK Star 37 solid apogee motor to
circularize the orbit at 20000 x 20000 km  x 55 deg.

Block IIR satellites were built by Lockheed Martin at its Valley Forge,
Pennsylvania site near Philadelphia. The factory opened in 1961 as
General Electric's Missiles and Space Division to build the Nimbus
weather satellites and possibly the Orbital Control Vehicles for the
KH-7 spy satellites (although one knowledgeable correspondent disagrees
with this last statement). Does anyone know if GE's "King of Prussia"
plant was the same as the Valley Forge one, or a separate one nearby?
(The two towns are next to each other).


IRVE-II
-------

The second Inflatable Reentry Vehicle Experiment, IRVE-II/NASA 36.254NR,
was launched from Wallops Island on a Black Brant IX on Aug 17. It
deployed an experimental 3-meter diameter inflatable heat shield; the
spacecraft survived reentry but was not designed to be recovered, and
fell in the Atlantic. A smaller precursor, IRVE-I/NASA 41.055NP, was
launched on a Terrier Orion in 2007.

PAN
---

United Launch Alliance launched an Atlas V 401, mission AV-018, from
Cape Canaveral on Sep 8. It carried the PAN communications satllite to a
13544 x 35400 km x 23.1 deg geostationary transfer orbit. PAN/P360 is a
Lockheed Martin A2100 satellite described as being for 'a US Government
customer'. It seems that LM operates the satellite on behalf of the
unidentified agency. 

The satellite has been given the US government designation USA 207, used
for secret government-owned satellites, so it is probably not a
contractor-owned leased-capacilty system like the Hughes Leasat
satellites operated for the Navy in the 1980s (which did not get USA numbers).

As first reported by spaceflightnow.com's Justin Ray, Ted Molczan 
suggests that PAN may be a satellite providing services for the CIA
replacing channels hosted on the US Navy's UHF/EHF communications
network, to bridge the gap between the old UHF Follow-On series and the
planned MUOS system, and Greg Roberts has tracked a beacon signal from
the satellite on a frequency used by the UHF Follow-On satellites.


Palapa D
--------

Indosat's Palapa D satellite was launched by a Chinese Chang Zheng 3B
rocket on Aug 31. The CZ-3B reached a low parking orbit, and the third
stage reignited for a second burn towards geostationary transfer
orbit. However, the engine shut down early leaving the Palapa D
in a 217 x 21138 km x 22.4 deg orbit. The satellite on Sep 2 used its
own on-board propulsion to reach the correct 216 x 35687 km x 22.2 deg
transfer orbit; this maneuver will however reduce its operational life.
By Sep 8 the satellite orbit was 9616 x 35670 km x 7.8 deg.

Indonesia has one of the developing world's more extensive satellite
fleets. The early Palapa satellites were owned and operated by
Indonesia's state telecom agency Perumtel, later Telkom. In 1996 a
privatization move put the Palapa satellites in the hands of the
Satelindo company, and in 2003 that company was absorbed by Indosat.
Meanwhile, Telkom operates a new series of satellites (Telkom 1 and 2);
Media Citra Indostar and Paskifik Satelite Nusantara  (with its ACeS
joint venture) also operate telecom satellites, and the LAPAN space
agency launches sounding rockets and operates the LAPAN-TUBSAT low orbit
satellite built with German assistance.

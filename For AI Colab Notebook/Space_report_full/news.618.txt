Shuttle and Station
--------------------

Japan's HTV-1 cargo vehicle has left the Station. It was released at
1731 UTC on Oct 30 and deorbited on Nov 1 at 2125 UTC over the S Pacific.

The Poisk module (Maliy Issledovatel'ny Modul'-2, MIM-2) was launched on
Nov 10. Poisk is the successor to the Pirs docking module and the Mir SO
module:

       Article         Spacecraft  Name    Mass       Cargo tug
1995   316GK No. 1     SO         -        4000 kg    None (STS-74)
2001   240GK No. 1L    SO         Pirs     3676 kg    Progress M-SO1 No. 301    
2009   240GK No. 2L    MIM-2      Poisk    3670 kg    Progress M-SO2 No. 302

Poisk is launched attached to a Progress propulsion module, Progress
M-MIM2 No. 302 (or M-SO2 No. 302). Poisk has the factory designation
240GK No. 2L and is loosely derived from the Soyuz BO (orbital module).
The module docked with the zenith docking port on Zvezda at 1541 UTC on
Nov 12. The propulsion module will be discarded in December.


Atlantis was launched on Nov 16 on mission STS-129. It docked with the
Station at 1651 UTC on Nov 18. Two Express Logistics Carrier pallets,
ELC-1 and ELC-2, were transferred to the station truss. The pallets
carry external spares such as gyros, which will be hard to get to the
station once the Shuttle is retired; two more ELCs will be delivered on
a later mission. On the first spacewalk on Nov 19, astronauts Foreman
and Satcher installed a spare S-band antenna on the Z1 truss segment and
lubed the robot arm fixtures on the mobile transporter and the Kibo arm.
 On the second spacewalk on Nov 21, Foreman and Bresnik installed
antennas on Columbus and relocated an electrostatic charging monitor
from S1 to P1, as well as deploying truss fixtures where equipment will
be mounted in future. The third spacewalk on Nov 23 by Satcher and
Bresnik began with airlock depressurization and hatch opening around
1322 UTC; they installed the MISSE 7 exposure experiment and a new
oxygen tank for the Quest airlock before closing the hatch at 1904 UTC
and repressurizing 2 min later.

The Atlantis crew of Charles Hobaugh, Barry Wilmore, Leland Melvin,
Randy Bresnik, Michael Foreman and Robert Satcher, supplemented by
Nicole Stott completing her tour as a station crew member, undocked on
Nov 25 at 0953 UTC. They returned to Earth on Nov 27 with the deorbit
burn at 1337 UTC lowering the orbit from 336 x 348 km to about 16 x 347
km. STS-129 landed on runway 33 at Kennedy Space Center at 1444 UTC.

Aboard the station with commander Jeff Williams (NASA) are Frank De
Winne (ESA/Belgium), Robert Thirsk (CSA/Canada), Roman Romanenko
(FKA/Russia), and Maksim Suraev (FKA/Russia). Expedition 22 began at
1500 UTC on Nov 24; Williams assumed command at 1812 UTC.

SMOS/PROBA-2
------------

Khrunichev launched a Rokot (UR-100N missile with Briz-KM upper stage)
from Plesetsk on Nov 2 and placed the European SMOS and PROBA-2
satellites in orbit. SMOS is the Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity
mission, obtaining climate-related data using a microwave
aperture-synthesis interferometer. PROBA-2 is a techology mission. SMOS
is in a 758 x 759 km x 98.4 deg orbit, PROBA-2 slightly lower at 709 x
728 km.

Shijian 11-1
------------

China has launched a test satellite 'Shijian shi yihao 01 xing', SJ-11-01,
which can be translated as 'Practice Sat 11-01' or 'Experiment Sat 11-01'.
SJ11-01 is in a 689 x 703 km x 98.3 deg orbit.

Kosmos-2455
-----------

A Russian Defense Ministry satellite was launched on Nov 20 and given
the cover name Kosmos-2455. It is probably the first Lotos-S electronic
intelligence satellite. Lotos-S satellites are built by TsSKB-Progress
Samara Space Center (Samara) and KB Arsenal (Sankt-Peterburg) for the
Russian Defense Ministry. Initial orbit is 199 x 904 km x 67.2 deg.
After a small perigee tweak on Nov 22, a major burn by the onboard
propulsion unit circularized the orbit at 903 x 906 km on Nov 23.

NASA 36.252UH
-------------

Webster Cash's latest X-ray spectroscopy payload was launched from White
Sands on Nov 14 to take a look at the Cyg Loop. This is probably a
reflight of the CyXESS payload first launched in Nov 2006.

TEXUS 46
--------

ESA and DLR launched a TEXUS microgravity rocket from Kiruna in
Sweden on Nov 22, carrying European and Japanese experiments.


IS-14
------

Intelsat IS-14 was launched on Nov 23 using a United Launch Alliance/
Lockheed Martin Atlas V rocket, model 431, serial AV-024. IS-14, a Loral
1300 class satellite with a launch mass of 5663 kg and dry mass of 2517
kg, will replace IS-1R at 24W over the Atlantic. Centaur AV-024 entered
an initial 175 x 25998 km x 25.0 deg orbit and then deployed IS-14 into
a 6157 x 39094 km x 22.5 deg transfer orbit at 0853 UTC.

W7
---

Eutelsat W7 was launched Nov 24 by ILS/Khrunichev Proton-M; it will
replace SESAT-1 with broadcasting and data services to Russia and Africa.


Erratum
--------

Michel Laliberte pointed out to me that the recent Centaur was not the
first solar orbit launch from Vandenberg - NRL's Clementine space probe
preceded it, in 1994.

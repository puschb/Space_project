Editorial
---------

This issue completes the first 21 years of JSR. I began the newsletter
in January 1989, at the request of friends who needed a compact summary
of space activities with all the technical details. After a few issues
of email distribution I started making available on the sci.space
newsgroups and  ftp. After the invention of the Web, I added the html
page in 1994 (sorry I haven't had the time to update it since then! I'll
learn CSS sometime in the next few years, I promise.) I'd like to thank
my thousands of loyal readers for listening to my ramblings, correcting
my mistakes, and sending me great technical information that I've been
able to share. I hope you continue to find the JSR useful.

Shuttle and Station
--------------------

The Expedition 22 crew currently consists of Jeff Williams, Maksim
Suraev, Oleg Kotov, T.J. Creamer and Soichi Noguchi. Astronauts Suraev
and Williams undocked from the Zvezda aft port in Soyuz TMA-16 at 1003
UTC on Jan 21, and flew the spacecraft around the station to dock with
the new Poisk module on the zenithal side of Zvezda. Soyuz TMA-17 is
docked with the nadir port on Zarya, Progress M-03M is at the Pirs port,
and the PMA-2 ports is empty. 

On Jan 11 the SSRMS robot arm was used to move the ESP-3 spare parts pallet
from the P3 truss to the S3 truss on the other side of the station.

On Jan 14 at 1005 UTC astronauts Suraev and Kotov, in Orlan-MK spacesuits
No. 4 and No. 5, emerged from the Pirs airlock to prepare the Poisk module
for use. Two bundles of thermal insulation were jettisoned at around
1200 and 1410 UTC. The astronauts returned to the airlock and closed the
hatch at 1549 UTC, completing Russian ISS spacewalk 24.

Beidou
------

China launched the third geostationary Beidou navigation satellite (di
san ke beidou daohang weixing) on Jan 16, the world's first orbital
launch of 2010. The CZ-3C rocket put Beidou DW3 in a 196 x 35620 km x
20.5 deg transfer orbit. The satellite is also called COMPASS-G1.

WISE
----

The WISE survey is beginning, with the first light image of a region
in Carina presented at the AAS meeting last week.

The initial mass of WISE was 661 kg full,
645 kg dry. JPL's Whitney Clavin reports to me that the ejected cryo
cover has a mass of 17 kg. The spacecraft is a Ball Aerospace RS-300,
with heritage from the NextSat satellite launched as part of the Air
Force's Orbital Express mission. Ball, based in Colorado, has been
building astronomy satellites since Orbiting Solar Observatory 1 in
1962.

2010 AL 30
----------

An apparently asteroidal object cataloged as 2010 AL 30 passed 130000 km
from the Earth on Jan 13. The object has a solar orbital period of exactly
one year, but is in an elliptical path which makes repeated close approaches
to Earth and Venus. Analysis by ESA's Michael Khan suggested that
it could be the Fregat stage from the Venus Express launch, which passed
close to Venus in early 2006.  The current orbit for 2010 AL 30 in JPL
Horizons suggests a pass 1.6M km from Venus on 2006 Feb 26, which would
not be close enough to be a match. The alternative explanation,
preferred by the Minor Planet Center, is that it's just a very lucky
passing rock.

Solar Eclipse
-------------

The Indian Space Research Organization launched  five RH-300 and two
RH-560 suborbital rockets on Jan 14-15 to study the solar eclipse of Jan
15. Four RH-200 mesospheric rockets were also flown. The RH-560 is
India's largest sounding rocket and is flown from the same Sriharikota
Island launch site used for India's orbital launches. The other, smaller
rockets used the Thumba Equatorial Rocket Launch Station (TERLS) site at
Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala; TERLS was India's first rocket launch
site, inaugurated in 1963.

Deep Space Probes Status
-------------------------

On 2010 Jan 1 Voyager 1 was 112.1 AU from the Sun and Voyager 2 was 91.0 AU from
the Sun. New Horizons is 15.5 AU from the Sun, between the orbits of Saturn and Uranus.

The Cassini spacecraft is in a 155000 x 2300000 km orbit around Saturn,
after 5.5 years in the Saturnian system. On Dec 28 at 0017 UTC it made
flyby 123TI/T64 of Titan at a height of 955 km; on Jan 12 at 2310 UTC it
made Titan flyby 124TI/T65 at a height of 1073 km. Flyby 125TI/T66 is
scheduled for Jan 28.

The Dawn asteroid probe is in a 1.50 x 1.94 AU x 6.5 deg solar orbit and
was 1.75 AU from the Sun on Jan 1. It continues to use its ion engines
to enlarge its orbit and is expected to reach Vesta in 2011. Rosetta is
in a 0.98 x 5.09 AU x 4.4 deg solar orbit moving outward from the Earth
towards its Jul 10 flyby of (21) Lutetia. 

Mars Odyssey, Mars Express and the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter remain
operating in Mars orbit, with the Spirit and Opportunity rovers sending
back data from the surface. The Mars Express orbit is 353 x 10333 km x
86.6 deg; Mars Odyssey is in a 387 x 450 km x 93 deg orbit and  MRO is
in a 225 x 320 km x 93 deg orbit.

Japan's Hayabusa spacecraft is in solar orbit between Mars and Earth,
and is targeting a midyear Earth return. The Deep Impact Flyby
Spacecraft, in a 0.97 x 1.02 AU x 6.7 deg orbit, will encounter comet
103P/Hartley-2 on Oct 11. Stardust is in a 0.97 x 1.73 AU x 8.5 deg
orbit and will pass comet P/Tempel 1 in Feb 2011.

The research craft Kepler, STEREO A, STEREO B, and Spitzer are also operating
in solar orbit close to the Earth, while WMAP, Herschel and Planck are at
Earth-Sun L2 and SOHO, Wind and ACE are at Earth-Sun L1.

Inside 1 AU, Venus Express continues operating in a 223 x
66589 km x 90.1 deg Venus orbit, and Messenger is in a 0.31 x 0.57 AU x
7.0 deg solar orbit setting up for Mercury arrival in Mar 2011.

The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter is in a roughly 40 x 60 km x 90 deg orbit around
the Moon. ARTEMIS P1 (formerly THEMIS P1) was in a 47058 x 356845 km x 59.5 deg
lunar transfer orbit by Jan 7. ARTEMIS P2 (formerly THEMIS P2) was in a 5518 x 258042 km
x 6.5 deg high Earth orbit, and will join P1 en route to the Moon. The IBEX
spacecraft is in a 8038 x 307710 km x 30.3 deg orbit almost at lunar distance.

Japan's small Ouna spacecraft was in low lunar orbit in 2009 but I haven't been able
to find up-to-date information on it; updates from readers would be welcome.

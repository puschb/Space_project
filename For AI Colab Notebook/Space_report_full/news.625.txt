Shuttle and Station
--------------------

The Soyuz TMA-16 ferry spaceship landed in Kazakhstan at 1124 UTC on Mar
18. Maksim Suraev and Jeff Williams returned to Earth aboard the
spacecraft, completing Expedition 22. With the undocking of TMA-16, the
remaining station crew of Oleg Kotov, TJ Creamer and Soichi Noguchi 
were deemed to become Expedition 23.

Soyuz TMA-18 was launched at 0404 UTC on Apr 2 with additional
Expedition 23 members commander Aleksandr Skvortsov, flight engineer 1
Mikhail Kornienko and flight engineer 2 Tracy Caldwell Dyson.
The flight is ISS mission 22S; the spacecraft is production article
11F732A17 No. 228. TMA-18 docked with the Poisk module at 0525 on Apr 4.
Soyuz TMA-17 remains docked to the Station at the Zarya nadir port, with
the complex in a 342 x 350 km x 51.6 deg orbit following a Mar 24-25 reboost
by the Progress M-04M tanker ship docked at the Zvezda port. Progress M-03M
is docked to the Pirs module. With the forthcoming docking of Discovery
there will be a full house at the Station with all active docking ports
in use (not counting the reserve PMA-3).

Space Shuttle OV-103 Discovery was launched at 1021 UTC on Apr 5 on
flight STS-131, ISS mission 19A. Discovery reached a 57 x 227 km orbit
at 1030 UTC and with the OMS-2 burn at 1100 UTC raised the perigee out
of the atmosphere to 227 x 259 km x 51.6 deg. After a further burn (NC1)
at 1307 UTC Discovery was in a 252 x 337 km orbit. Mission STS-131 will
carry the Leonardo MPLM logistics module and the Lightweight MPESS
carrier, to deliver cargo and supplies to the Station. A malfunction of
Discovery's Ku-band antenna system means that there will be less live
video than usual, but the problem will not prevent the Shuttle from
completing its mission.

The crew of Discovery are Commander Alan Poindexter, Pilot James Dutton,
and Mission Specialists Richard Mastracchio, Dorothy
Metcalf-Lindenburger, Stephanie Wilson, Naoko Yamazaki, and Clayton
Anderson. The thirteen astronauts of STS-131 and Expedition 23  equal
the record for humans in space at one time with Caldwell-Dyson,
Metcalf-Lindenburger, Wilson and Yamazaki breaking the record for the
number of women in space at once, and Yamazaki and Noguchi marking the
first time two Japanese astronauts have flown simultaneously.

Echostar XIV
------------

The Echostar XIV satellite took off from Baykonur on Mar 20. The
Proton-M rocket put the upper stage package in a -490 x 170 km x 51.5
deg suborbital path. The first Briz-M burn reached a 173 x 173 km x 51.5
deg orbit. Later burns went to 270 x 4999 km x 50.3 deg, 430 x 35805 km
x 49.1 deg,  and 3121 x 35785 km x 26.7 deg. Echostar separated from the
Briz-M at 0336 UTC on Mar 21. By Apr 4 it was on station at 138.6W in a
35784 x 35788 km x 0.1 deg geostationary orbit.

Echostar XIV is a Loral LS-1300 satellite with a dry mass of
3223 kg, and 6379 kg fully fuelled. Solar panels are probably
around 31.0 m span.


Yaogan Weixing 9
----------------

It is now clear that YW-9 is accompanied by two manueverable
subsatellites, and is indeed presumably in some way analogous to the
US ocean surveillance satellite triplets which used similar orbits.
The three satellites are in a 1080 x 1100 km x 63.4 deg orbit.

SDO
---

SDO reached geosynchronous orbit at 102.9W on Mar 18. Orbit
is now 35781 x 35790 km x 28.1 deg, and SDO's telescope doors
are open to the Sun with all instruments undergoing checkout
and so far looking healthy.

Robert White
-------------

Gen. Robert White died on 17 Mar at the age of 85. White was the first
of the X-15 pilots to reach the 80 km level which I count as the
boundary of space. On 1962 Jul 17 he flew X-15-3 from Delamar Dry Lake,
Nevada to Edwards Air Force Base on a 10-minute suborbital flight
reaching 96 km altitude.

Cassini
-------

The Cassini spacecraft made a 7461 km flyby of Titan at 1550 UTC on Apr
5, and is on course to pass Dione at an altitude of 500 km at 0516 UTC
on Apr 7. The Titan flyby raised the height of Cassini's orbit
from 114700 x 2383000 km x 0.37 deg to 152400 x 2646000 km x 0.37 deg.

Suborbital flights
-------------------

MAXUS 8 was launched from ESRANGE, Kiruna, Sweden on Mar 26 lofting an
807 kg European Space Agency microgravity payload to 700 km. The rocket
was launched by Rymbdbolaget (the Swedish Space Corp.) and Astrium.

NASA 12.067GT was launched from Wallops Island on Mar 27 to test the new
Terrier/Improved Malemute sounding rocket. Two student cubesats,
Frontier I and CP-1U, were carried on the suborbital flight. Launch was
from the 50K launcher at Launch Area 1 and the flight reached 270 km.

The Indian Prithvi missile and its Dhanush naval variant were tested
within a few minutes of each other at India's Integrated Test Range in
Orissa on Mar 27. Later the same day the larger Agni I ballistic
missile, derived from the first stage of India's original Satellite
Launch Vehicle-3, was also tested from ITR into the Bay of Bengal.

Shuttle and Station
--------------------

Space Shuttle Discovery docked with the PMA-2 port on the Harmony node
on Apr 8. Astronauts Mastracchio and Anderson made three spacewalks in
suits EMU 3017 and 3008) from the Quest airlock on Apr 9, 11 and 13.
During the spacewalks they replaced an ammonia tank assembly (ATA) on
the S1 truss.

The ammonia is used as a coolant fluid in the truss thermal control
system. In EVA-1 the station robot arm (SSRMS) moved the new ATA  from
the LMC carrier in the Shuttle bay to the ESP-2, where the astronauts
attached a temporary handle. Then the ATA was moved to the Mobile Base
System (MBS) on the truss. During EVA-2 the astronauts removed the old
ATA from S1 and handed it to the robot arm which temporarily placed it
on one of the truss CETA carts. The SSRMS then picked up the the new ATA
from the MBS, moved it to near S1 and handed it to the astronauts who
bolted it to the truss. The old ATA was then moved from the CETA cart to
the MBS. During EVA-3 the astronauts hooked up fluid lines to the newly
installed ATA; then the SSRMS moved the old ATA to the Shuttle payload
bay where Mastracchio and Anderson fixed it to the LMC for the trip home
to Earth, where it will be refurbished. Some stubborn bolts made all of
this take longer than expected and some other tasks were cancelled,
notably the return to Earth of the MISSE-LWAPA adapter  plate fixture
attached to Columbis (the plate had held the MISSE 6 experiment which
was returned to Earth on an earlier mission). The crew did retrieve the
SEEDS experiment from the Kibo Exposed Facility and replace a gyro in
S1, among other minor tasks.

Meanwhile, the Leonardo module was moved from the payload bay
to the zenith CBM port on the Harmony module between 0322 and 0424 UTC
on Apr 8. Among the cargo transferred from Leonardo was the Crew Quarters 4
rack, the MELFI-3 freezer, the WORF (Window Orbital Research Facility)
which will be placed over Destiny's window to host observation experiments,
the MARES exercise device, and EXPRESS Rack 7. On Apr 15 at 2025
the SSRMS unberthed Leonardo from Harmony; it was left hanging overnight
and then berthed back in Discovery's bay at 0708 UTC Apr 16.

The hatches between Discovery and PMA-2/Harmony were closed at 1030 UTC
on Apr 17 and the Shuttle undocked at 1252 UTC. It made a loop around
the Station at about 160m distance and then departed at 1401 UTC.
On Apr 20 Discovery fired its OMS engines at 1203 UTC to reduce its velocity by
92m/s, changing its orbit from 322 x 345 km to around 13 x 344 km. 
Orbiter OV-103 landed on runway 33 at Kennedy Space Center at 1308:35 UTC
after 15 days 2 hours 47 min 10s of flight of which 15 days 2 hours 20 min
were in space (above 80 km).

Leonardo has made 7 flights into space; its sibling MPLM (Multi-Purpose
Logistics Module) Raffaello has made 3. The module is about 4400 kg
empty but launch masses have ranged from 8300 to 12750 kg. Here's my
best guess for the launch and landing masses of the MPLM (this does not
include the ROEU umbilical which is attached to the payload bay sidewall
to provide power while MPLM is in the bay and which I believe has a mass
of 127 kg.) However, different sources give different masses, so don't
take this table as definitive. (Figures for 2001-2006 are from Capararo
et al 2007, IAC-07-B3.3.04).

Leonardo will be converted to become the PMM (Permanent Multipurpose Module)
and will be left on the station on its next flight.

The remaining flights currently on the Shuttle manifest are:
 STS-132  with the Rassvet docking and cargo module
 STS-133  with the Leonardo PMM
 STS-134  with the AMS-02 particle physics experiment


CryoSat-2
----------

ESA's CryoSat-2 made it to orbit on Apr 8 aboard a Dnepr launch vehicle.
Dnepr is a refurbished R-36MUTTKh missile; it was launched by MK Kosmotras
from LC109/95, an underground silo at the Baykonur spaceport. The two
main stages put the payload module on a suborbital trajectory; the final
stage MIRV bus then performs the low-thrust orbit insertion burn,
dragging the payload behind it ino a 710 x 726 km x 92.0 deg orbit.  The
final stage ended up in a higher orbit of 716 x 1119 km.

CryoSat-2 will study the thickness of the polar ice caps. It replaces
CryoSat-1, which inspected the polar ice cap rather too closely in 2005 when
the Rokot launch vehicle malfunctioned and dumped it in the Arctic.
The satellite carries a Ku-band radar.

GSLV
----

The first flight of India's GSLV Mk II failed on Apr 15. The GSLV-D3's
new CUS12 third stage engines did not operate and the vehicle tumbled
after second stage separation, remaining in a suborbital -4400 x 137 km
x 19 deg trajectory above the Bay of Bengal. The vehicle reentered 8
minutes after launch at 1105 UTC, probably over the Andaman Sea. The
previous GSLV model used a Russian-built upper stage; this flight had
the ISRO CUS12 using the Indian Cryogenic Engine. The ICE has a 69.5 kN
LOX/LH2 main engine and two 2 kN vernier steering engines. The main
engine reportedly ignited for one second but then the turbopump failed
and the vehicle started falling back to Earth.

Payload was GSAT-4, with a Ka-band communications system and a GPS-augmentation
navigation transmitter.

 
Kosmos-2462
------------

A new Russian Defense Ministry satellite, Kosmos-2462, was launched on
Apr 16 into a 169 x 327 km x 67.2 deg orbit. It is probably a Kobal't-M
recoverable imaging spy satellite built by KB Arsenal. 


Suborbital flights
------------------

The US Air Force Research Lab and Australia's Defense Science and Technology
Organization launched the HIFiRE-1 hypersonic test flight on Mar 22 from
Woomera. Launch vehicle was a Terrier Mk 70/Improved Orion and planned
apogee was 288 km. The flight follows a HIFiRE-0 precursor test last year.

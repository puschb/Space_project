Columbia returned to KSC on Dec 20 and will be stored in the VAB prior
to processing for STS-40.  Discovery is being prepared for the STS-39
mission.  The STS-39 external tank was mated to the solid rocket
boosters in the Vehicle Assembly Building this week. 

STS schedule:
STS-39  February  Discovery  AFP-675 and IBSS
STS-37  April     Atlantis   Gamma Ray Observatory
STS-40  May       Columbia   Spacelab Life Sciences 1

Afans'ev and Manarov continue in orbit aboard the
Mir/Kvant/Kvant-2/Kristall/Soyuz TM-11 complex.

Kosmos-1631 reentered on Dec 8. It was a radar calibration satellite.

The Pakistani amateur radio satellite BADR-A reentered on Dec 8.

The Kosmos-2102 recon satellite reentered on Dec 12, completing its 2
month mission as predicted in issue 57. 

Kosmos-2109, 2110, and 2111 were launched on Dec 8 by a single Proton
vehicle from Baykonur. They are GLONASS navigation satellites, the
Soviet version of the American Navstar GPS system, in 20000 km high
orbits at 65 degree inclination.

Kosmos-2112 was launched on Dec 12 by the R-14 based Kosmos launch
vehicle from Plesetsk. It is in a 700 km orbit at 74 degrees inclination,
and believed to be a store-dump communications relay satellite used
by the Soviet military or the KGB.

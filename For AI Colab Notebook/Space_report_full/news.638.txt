Shuttle and Station
-------------------

Space Shuttle Discovery was launched on Feb 25 on mission STS-133.
Discovery's  main cargo is Leonardo, the Permanent Multipurpose Module
(PMM), a cargo storage unit to be added to the station. The ELC-4
logistics carrier is also aboard.

Expedition 26 is now underway with crew commander Scott Kelly,  flight
engineer-2 Aleksandr Kaleri, flight engineer-3 Oleg Skripochka, flight
engineer-4 Dmitri Kondratev, flight engineer-5 Paolo Nespoli and flight
engineer-6 Cady Coleman aboard the Station. Soyuz TMA-01M is docked at
Poisk, Progress M-07M at Zvezda, and Soyuz TMA-20 at Rassvet.

Kounotori 2 arrived at the Station on Jan 27. It was grappled by the
SSRMS arm and berthed on the nadir port of the Harmony module at 1451 UTC. 
Progress M-09M was launched from Baykonur on Jan 28. According
to nasaspaceflight.com, the cargo ship carries Energia's 30 kg Kedr amateur
radio minisatellite. It docked with Pirs on Jan 30 at 0239 UTC.

Skripochka and Kondratev made another spacewalk, Russian EVA 28, on
Feb 16. Pirs airlock hatch open/close was 1330 UTC to 1821 UTC, with one small
piece of debris floating away at 1330 UTC and the Ferrozond foot restraint
jettisoned at 1654 UTC. The Molniya-Gamma and SVCh-Radiometria experiments
were installed on the Russian segment of the station, and two experimental
insulation panels were retrieved. The astronauts used spacesuits Orlan MK-4
and MK-5 respectively.

On Feb 16 the European Space Agency's second Automated Transfer Vehicle,
ATV 2 "Johannes Kepler" was launched by Ariane 5ES vehicle 544 from
Kourou. The core stage flew to a -1274 x 139 km x 51 deg orbit; first
EPS burn reached a 142 x 256 km orbit at 2208 UTC, followed by
circulazation at 268 x 271 km at 2250 UTC and ATV separation at 2254 UTC. The
EPS third burn at 0015 UTC on Feb 17 was used to deorbit the stage. The
separated ATV has a mass of 19712 kg.
ATV 2 docked with the Station's Zvezda module on Feb 25.


Geo-IK-2
--------

Russia's Geo-IK-2 No. 11 satellite, built by ISS Reshetnev, was stranded
in transfer orbit when the Rokot launch vehicle's Briz-KM upper stage
failed to restart for its second burn on Feb 1. The payload and rocket
are being tracked in 355 x 933 km  and 319 x 1053 km x 99.5 deg orbits.
The model 14F31 satellite is based on the Glonass-M bus and so probably has a mass
around 1400 kg.

RPP
---

The National Reconnaissance Office's Rapid Pathfinder Program technology
satellite was launched on Feb 6. No details are available; it presumably
ended up in a polar orbit between 500 and 1500 km.

Suborbital launches
-------------------

The Far-ultraviolet Imaging Rocket Experiment (FIRE) was launched from
the Poker Flat Research Range in Alaska on Jan 28. The telescope,
developed by Jim Green's group at U Colorado/Boulder, imaged the nearby
galaxy M51 in the 900-1100A far ultraviolet band.

The Polar NOx payload was also launched from Poker Flat in early Feb,
but failed to return science data.

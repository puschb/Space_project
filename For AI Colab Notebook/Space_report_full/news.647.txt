UARS
----

NASA's UARS satellite reentered on Sep 24. The Upper Atmosphere Research
Satellite was deployed in 1991 from the Space Shuttle Discovery on
mission STS-48. UARS studied the depletion of the ozone layer, confirming
that CFCs cause the `ozone hole', and improved models of upper atmosphere
chemistry, including studies of methane in the Antarctic, sulphur dioxide
from volcanoes, and global wind measurements.

UARS reportedly began entering the atmosphere over the Pacific but  the
exact time and location are not known. Reports of debris entry over
Canada are unconfirmed, and my best conclusion bast on these estimates
and the absence of confirmed observations over the west coast is that
entry was probably over the Pacific SE to E of Hawaii around 0410-0415
UTC with the debris falling over a several hundred km range in the ocean
falling short of the Oregon/Washington coastline.

The official USSTRATCOM report says: "24 September. 04:16 UTC +/- 53
minutes ascending 30.9 N 218.9E over the Pacific." Be very careful with
this - they don't really mean that it reentered over the Pacific, just
that that is the midpoint of the range of uncertainty. So this
translates to 0323 UTC to 0509 UTC. At the NASA press conference, Nick
Johnson said he thought a +/- 20 minute range was probable so 0356 to
0436 UTC. During that period of time UARS would have passed from the
Pacific near New Zealand (0352), over the Pacific south of Hawaii
(0407), crossing into N America over Portland, Oregon (0418) and then up
over Canada, crossing the Labrador coast (0428) and then SE over the
Atlantic to Mauritania (0440).

I would have expected the DSP missile early warning satellites to have
detected infrared radiation from the entry - they do keep a close watch
on the eastern Pacific in case of a submarine-launched missile attack on
the US. It is a bit surprising to me that there's apparently no
information from that source - or at least none that's been admitted.

Note that ROSAT, which will reenter later this year, is much less massive
overall but has larger parts that will survive reentry. 


Large Uncontrolled Reentries 
-----------------------------

Here's a list of big things falling from orbit - excluding
controlled deorbits - in order of mass (my best estimate of mass at reentry time).

Some of the above list represent rocket stages that got stranded in low orbit
with all their fuel aboard. It's possible that in some cases the fuel got vented before
reentry, in which case the mass would be much less. Kosmos-1917-1918-1919 is
one example.  A few examples, like Polyus, were propulsive deorbits done
accidentally, which I count as 'uncontrolled'.

International Space Station
---------------------------

Soyuz TMA-21 undocked from the Poisk module at 0038 UTC on Sep 16
carrying Aleksandr Samokutyaev, Ron Garan and Andrey Borisenko.
Expedition 29 began at 0038 UTC on Sep 16 with Mike Fossum as commander,
and with flight engineers Sergey Volkov and Satoshi Furukawa.

Soyuz TMA-02M remains docked at the Station. Progress M-13M is scheduled
for launch Oct 31; Soyuz TMA-03M on Nov 12.


Soyuz statistics
-----------------

A reader has asked me to clarify that the Soyuz/Fregat which failed to
reach the correct orbit was due to procedures error (incorrect fuelling)
and was not a Fregat manufacturing or hardware failure. In general, I
have noticed anecdotally (small number statistics) that an increasing
number of failures have been due to procedural mistakes at launch time
(wrong amount of fuel, wrong software command, etc.), compared
to the old-school method of blowing the rocket up by getting the
plumbing wrong during manufacture. Another metric that would
be interesting to generate is to distinguish operator from manufacturer
errors, although this could be difficult - maybe inadequately clear
manufacturer's documentation is the root error for some operator
failures?

ZX-1A
-----

Following last month's launch failure, China has resumed successful flights.
The military communications satellite Zhongxing 1A (Chinasat 1A) was
launched on Sep 18 into geostationary transfer orbit using a Chang
Zheng (Long March) 3B.

Kosmos-2473
-----------

The first Garpun military communications satellite was launched on Sep
20 from Baykonur and given the cover name Kosmos-2473. Garpun is thought
to be a data relay satellite built by ISS Reshetnev. As of Sep 24 an
object from the launch (perhaps the Briz-M DTB tank) was being tracked
by the US in a 402 x 35586 km x 48.6 deg transfer orbit; it is reported
from Russian sources that the payload is actually in geosynchronous orbit.

Ariane 5
--------

The Arabsat 5C and SES-2 satellites were launched on Sep 21 by vehicle
561. Arabsat 5C is an Astrium/Thales Eurostar 3000 C-band/Ka-band
communications satellite  for Arab countries. SES-2 is an Orbital
Star-2.4 satellite for SES World Skies. The satellite carries a
communications payload with 24 C-band and 24 Ku-band transponders, and a
US Air Force infrared surveillance sensor experiment. The satellites
were deployed into a 250 x 35700 km x 1.9 deg transfer orbit.

IGS O-4
-------

On Sep 23 JAXA launched the IGS Optical-4 (Jouhou shuushuu eisei kougaku
4 gouki)  satellite to replenish Japan's imaging spy satellite
constellation.

Atlantic Bird 7
---------------

Eutelsat's Atlantic Bird 7 communications satellite, an Astrium Eurostar
3000, was launched into geostationary transfer orbit on Sep 24 by a
Zenit-3SL rocket. This was the first launch by the new Sea Launch
company, which is 95 percent owned by RKK Energia. The old Sea Launch,
which declared bankruptcy, was a joint venture led by Boeing involving
Yuzhnoe, who build the Zenit-2SB core vehicle, Energia who build the
Blok DM-SL third stage and Kvaerner who built the floating launch
platform. There were 30 Sea Launch missions between 1999 and 2009.

Space Station
-------------

Expedition 30 continues with Soyuz TMA-22 docked at Poisk and Soyuz
TMA-03M docked to the Rassvet module. Ex-30 commander is Dan Burbank;
flight engineers 1 to 5 are Anton Shkaplerov, Anatoliy Ivanishin, Oleg
Kononenko, Andre Kuipers, Don Pettit. The Progress M-14M cargo ship
is docked at the Pirs module. On Mar 17 the International Space
Station was in a 378 x 400 km x 51.6 deg orbit.

The European Space Agency is preparing for the launch of the ATV cargo
vehicle 'Edoardo Amaldi' from Kourou. The ATV-3 vehicle will dock at the
Zvezda module.


REQUEST
-------

I'm looking for TLE data for Soyuz TM-5 (19204) for 1988 Sep 1 to Sep 7
(a time period that includes the multiple reentry attempts).
The online archive is missing this data, but I know some of you have
hoarded the paper copies...

Note
-----
For those of you in DC, I'll be giving an informal astronomy presentation on Fri
Mar 23, 2-4pm at my exhibit at the Natural History Museum 
 http://www.mnh.si.edu/exhibits/evolving-universe/


SES-4
------

The SES-4 communications satellite reached its checkout orbit
at the 26W Atlantic Ocean slot on Feb 29. At launch it was owned
by SES Satellite Leasing (Isle of Man); it will be operated by 
SES World Skies (den Haag).

Beidou
------

China launched the 11th Beidou Daohang Weixing on Feb 24.
The navigation satellite entered geostationary orbit over 58.7E
on Mar 1. On Mar 17 the orbit was 35777 x 35796 km x 1.9 deg
at 58.6E.

Four geostationary Beidou Daohang Shiyan Weixing (Experimental Beidou
Navigation Satellite) satellites were laucnhed in 2000-2007; since then
the operational Beidou Daohang Weixing system has included one medium
orbit satellite, five GEO satellites and five inclined-GEO satellites.

MUOS 1
------

The US Navy's first Mobile User Objective System (MUOS)
was orbited on Feb 24 by a powerful Atlas 551 vehicle, flight AV-030.
The MUOS payload was delivered to a 3463 x 35786 km x 19.0 deg transfer
orbit. MUOS 1 has a dry mass of 3812 kg and is about 6740 kg fully fuelled;
it is based on the Lockheed Martin A2100 spacecraft and will support
UHF communications.

Following UHF comms experiments with Lincoln Lab's LES satellites in the
1960s, the US Navy began using the UHF payload on the Tacsat satellite
(1969-1972). This was followed by the Marisat Gapfiller payloads (from
1976), the FLTSATCOM system (from 1978) and the 'UHF Follow-On' system (from
1993), which the MUOS system will supersede.


LARES
-----

The LARES satellite launched on the first Vega flight is the latest
in a series of passive, spherical, high (usually) mass-to-surface-area satellites
carrying mirrors and laser retroreflectors for geodetic applications.

The name of the attached payload on the Vega AVUM stage is the LARES
A&H/SS  (Avionics and Harness Subsystem) and consists of several boxes
on one `petal' (sector) of the LARES support system. The system is built
by Temis S.r.l. of Milano, while the overall support system is built by
the Milan company OHB CGS (formerly Carlo Gavazzi Space). Overall mass
of the LARES support system is probably 300 kg, and the dry AVUM is
around 660 kg for a total in orbit mass for the object of about 960 kg.

Suborbital flights
-------------------

Cornell's MICA (Magnetosphere-Ionosphere Coupling in the Alfven
resonator) auroral study payload, NASA flight 36.273UE, was launched on
Feb 19. The rocket reached 325 km and deployed a pair of payloads to
study auroral Alfven wave resonances; the aft payload carried wire
antennas measuring 12m tip-to-tip and had a mass of about 45 kg. The
forward payload was 303 kg.

US Global Strike Command launched a Minuteman III from Vandenberg on
Feb 25, carrying a single reentry vehicle which flew to a target
in the Pacific, probably near the Kwajalein Atoll test range.

On Feb 22 the US Navy launched a Trident II D-5 missile from the USS
Tennessee submarine, SSBN 734, off the coast of Cape Canaveral, as
flight DASO-23 (Demonstration and Shakedown Operation). The missile flew
southeast down the Eastern Test Range, inserting the post-boost bus onto
a suborbital trajectory. The bus probably deployed 8 reentry vehicles,
either Mk 4 or Mk 5 type, possibly for impact near Ascension Island.
This was the 137th consecutive success from Trident II; the previous
acknowledged launch was the 135th, mission DASO-22, in March 2011,
implying that an unacknowledged launch occurred sometime in the past
year from the Pacific coast by an unidentifed submarine. The Pacific
launches are not always announced even after the submarine in question
has completed its patrol,  for reasons that are not really clear. A
total of 5 launches between 2005 and 2011 have unknown dates: successful
flights nos. 112 (DASO?), 114 (FCET-35?), 115 (FCET-35?),  125
(FCET-40), and 136 (FCET-44?).

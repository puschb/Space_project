International Space Station
----------------------------

On the ISS, Expedition 32 continues with astronauts Gennadiy Padalka, Sergey
Revin, Joseph Acaba, Yuriy Malenchenko, Sunita Willams and Akihiko Hoshide.
Soyuz TMA-05M docked with the Rassvet module on Jul 17 at 0451 UTC.

Progress M-15M redocked with Pirs at 0101 UTC on Jul 29 in a successful test
of the new Kurs-NA automatic rendezvous system. The cargo ship undocked once
more on Jul 30 at 2119 UTC; on Aug 6 it was in a 402 x 440 km orbit.

Progress M-16M was launched on Aug 1 at 1935 UTC and tested a new fast
rendezvous profile, docking with Pirs only 5hr 43min after launch on Aug
2 at 0118 UTC. Europe's Edoardo Amaldi ATV remains docked to the
station; the Japanese HTV-3 was berthed on the Harmony node on Jul 27.
The SSRMS grappled the HTV Exposed Pallet on Jul 27, and unberthed it at
0709 UTC  on Aug 6. SSRMS transferred the EP to the JEM RMS arm, which
then installed the EP on the Kibo Exposed Facility at the EFU 10 slot at
1204 UTC Aug 6 for offloading of its cargo, the SCAN and MCE packages.

Curiosity at Mars
------------------

The Mars Science Laboratory 'Curiosity' landed successfully on Mars on
Aug 6 at 0517:57 UTC. The rover landed in Cydonia's Gale Crater at 
137.4402  deg longitude, -4.5918 deg latitude. Congratulations to the
MSL team! For the rest of us, I recommend the Martian Chronicles blog of
my friend Ryan Anderson, Earth's main expert on Gale Crater:
http://blogs.agu.org/martianchronicles/ and of course Emily at the PlanSoc
http://www.planetary.org/blogs/emily-lakdawalla/

Imaging by MRO has located the impact sites, of the Skycrane (1.2 km
away), heatshield, and parachute (0.6km away) and six EMBDs (10 km
away); I could probably calculate the lat/lon of these sites but I'm
hoping one of my readers has done it already (hint...). Impact location
of the CMBDs is not yet known. 

MSL was launched on 2011 Nov 26 into a 0.98 x 1.54 AU solar orbit with
an ecliptic inclination of 1.7 deg.  On Aug 4 it entered the Martian
gravitational sphere of influence on a hyperbola with an inclination of
5.1 deg and periares of -64 km; it entered the Martian atmosphere on Aug
6. The sequence of events, as best I have been able to determine them,
was: (updated Aug 8 based on the list by Patrick Blau at
spaceflight101.com and supplemented by my own research).

   0534       First images received showing rover wheel on surface.

  Previous Mars missions have typically dumped about 1 tonne each into the Martian atmosphere,
  with about half that as intact landed mass; MSL sent almost 4 tonnes in with 
  almost 1 tonne landing intact.

  Does anyone know the expected orbital lifetime of the abandoned MGS?
  
Rokot
-----

The Khrunichev Rokot launch vehicle returned to flight on Jul 28 putting
four satellites in low orbit. Kosmos-2481 is a Strela-3M military
communications satellite; two Gonets-M satellites are the civilian
counterparts of the Strela-3M; and MiR is a small technology satellite.
MiR, named after spacecraft designer Mikhail Reshetnyov (1924-1996),
carries student technology experiments from SibGAU, the Siberian State
Aerospace University in Krasnoyarsk. The satellites were deployed in a
1483 x 1506 km x 82.5 deg orbit; the Briz upper stage then made a
depletion burn to 1164 x 1504 km. Briz malfunctioned during the previous
Rokot launch in 2011, leaving the Geo-IK-2 satellite in the wrong orbit,
but this time appears to have operated correctly.

Arianespace
-----------

Arianespace flight VA208, probably using Ariane 5ECA launcher L564,
placed two communications satellites in geostationary transfer orbit on
Aug 2. Intelsat IS-20 will provide C and Ku-band comms to Asia, Africa
and the MidEast, replacing IS-7. It is a Loral 1300 satellite with a
mass of 6094 kg full 2989 kg dry. The much smaller Hylas 2, for Avanti
Communications, will support Europe, Africa and the MidEast with Ka-band
broadband communications; it is an Orbital Star-2.4E with a mass of 3311
kg full 1532 kg dry. By Aug 7 the payloads were in 30622 x 35780 km x 0.1 deg
and 18268 x 35774 km x 1.0 deg orbits (not clear which is which yet)
while the ESC-A stage and SYLDA were in a 252 x 35752 km x 5.9 deg orbit.


IGS Radar-1
-----------

Japan's Jouhoushushu eisei Reda 1 gouki satellite, known in English as
Information Gathering Satellite 1B, or IGS Radar-1, reentered on Jul 26
over the Pacific. The 1200 kg satellite lost power in 2007.

Proton failure
---------------

A Proton launched from Baykonur on Aug 6 placed a Briz-M upper stage with
two communications satellites in a suborbital path. The Briz-M burned to a 173 km
initial orbit, and then restarted to reach a 200 x 5000 km intermediate
orbit. However the third burn failed after only 7 seconds, leaving the
vehicle in a 266 x 5015 km x 49.9 deg orbit instead of continuing
towards geostationary altitude. The two payloads and the DTB drop tank
separated from the Briz, so there are four objects being tracked in this
orbit. They will probably reenter within one year.

Telkom-3 is an ISS Reshetnev Ekspress-1000H-class satellite for PT
Telkom of Indonesia; mass was 1903 kg full. Ekspress-MD2 is a Khrunichev
Yakhta-class satellite for Kosmicheskiya Svyaz, the Russian domestic
communications satellite operator; mass was 1140 kg full.

Tianlian
--------

The Chinese Tianlian-1(03) relay satellite was on station at 16.7E by Aug 6.


2012 Orbital launch summary to date
-----------------------------------

45 launches: 
Russia China USA  Europe Japan India Iran N Korea
  15    11   9     5      2     1     1    1(fail)

Suborbital flights
------------------

JAXA followed on from NASA's IRVE-3 flight, launching their own MAAC
(Membrane Aeroshell for Atmospheric Entry Capsule)
inflatable reentry vehicle test from the Uchinoura Space Center
on Aug 7. The 20 kg, 1.2-meter-diameter test vehicle reentered from 150 km.


Erratum
-------

The TET-1 satellite was built by Astro-und-Feinwerktechnik Adlershof GmbH,
not TUB; Kayser-Threde is the prime contractor, but the
satellite is owned by DLR, the German space research agency.

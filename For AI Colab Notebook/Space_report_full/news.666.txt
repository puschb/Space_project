International Space Station
----------------------------

On the ISS, Expedition 32 continues with astronauts Gennadiy Padalka, Sergey
Revin, Joseph Acaba, Yuriy Malenchenko, Sunita Willams and Akihiko Hoshide.

On Aug 30 astronauts Williams and Hoshide made spacewalk US EVA-18 from
the Quest airlock using spacesuits EMU 3011 and 3015, to attempt
replacement of a failed Main Bus Switching Unit (MBSU) on the S0 truss.
The S0 carries four MBSUs designated MBSU-1 to MBSU-4; two spares are
stored on the ESP-2 pallet outside the Quest module. One spare was
delivered on STS-114 and a second on STS-120; they don't have publicly
known serial numbers. The failed MBSU-1 was removed from S0 and stowed
temporarily at ESP2; the STS-114 spare was removed from ESP-2 and moved
to S0, becoming the 'new MBSU-1'.  However, a problematic bolt stopped
the astronauts completing the installation. They left the new  MBSU-1
partly bolted to S0 and returned to the airlock, leaving the Station
with two of its eight large solar arrays out of the main station power
loop.

Quest was depressurized for EVA-18 at about 1205 UTC on Aug 30, with an EVA duration 
of 8h28m (depress/repress), 8h17m (NASA rule), 8h14m (hatch open/close).

On Sep 5 Williams and Hoshide tried again on US EVA-19. After problems
with EMU 3015 on EVA-18, this time the duo used spacesuits EMU 3010 and
3011 respectively. The astronauts removed the new MBSU-1, with some
difficulty unjamming the critical bolt, and then spent an hour  using
several techniques to clean out metal shavings and foreign matter from
the bolt. Between 1522 and 1550 UTC the installation of the new MBSU-1
was successfully carried out, and station power was mostly restored,
although in the meantime the failure of the DSCU-3A box has taken down
another of the arrays. The astronauts then replaced a CLPA camera on the
SSRMS robot arm and returned to the airlock. The old MBSU-1 remains in its `temporary'
stowage location on ESP-2.

Quest was depressurized at 1101 UTC Sep 5 for a duration of 6h33m (depress/repress),
6h28m (NASA rule), 6h25m (Hatch open/close).

I was wrong about some of the debris panel numbers in the last JSR:
my current best understanding is:

RBSP
----

NASA's two Radiation Belt Storm Probes were launched on Aug 30. Atlas V's Centaur AV-032 entered
a 167 x 600 km x 25.5 deg parking orbit at 0819 UTC, and a second burn at 0915 UTC
raised the orbit and lowered inclination for deployment of RBSP-A in a 597 x 30645 km x 10.0 deg
orbit at 0924 UTC. After a small orbit adjust burn by Centaur AV-032, RBSP-B was
deployed at 0936 UTC in a 601 x 30709 km x 10.0 deg orbit. A further orbit adjust at about 0948 UTC
put the Centaur in a  -220 x 36062 km x 10.3 deg orbit, and it reentered over the Atlantic at
about 1940 UTC.

The almost-identical RBSP satellites have a mass of 658 kg full, and will deploy a series
of booms include electric field antennae spanning 100 meters. The instruments study
energetic particles, thermal plasma, ionospheric composition and electromagnetic fields and waves.
The principal investigator for one experiment, the relativistic proton spectrometer,
is at the National Reconnaissance Office, and NRO put out a press release explaining why
operational agencies care about good radiation belt models too - all true, but I suspect
it might be just that they want their tame in-house space physicist to have some research time
to keep his hand in.

Vesta and Ceres
---------------

Dawn escaped Vesta's gravity at 0626 UTC on Sep 5 and is now in solar orbit on its way to Ceres,
which it should reach in 2015.


Mars
----

The Curiosity landing site in Gale Crater has been named `Bradbury Landing'
after writer Ray Bradbury (1920-2012).

Earth
------

On Aug 24 Neil A. Armstrong died of complications from heart surgery in
Columbus, Ohio, a few weeks after his 82nd birthday. Armstrong was born
in Wapakoneta, Ohio in 1930. After flying 78 missions as a US Navy pilot
in the Korean War he joined the NACA research agency which became NASA
in 1958 and made four flights in the X-1B rocket plane in 1957-58.  In
Apr 1962, while a NASA civilian test pilot at the Flight Research Center
at Edwards, Armstrong became a mesonaut, flying the X-15-3 rocketplane
into the Earth's mesosphere on flights 3-3-7 and 3-4-8, reaching apogees
of 55 and 63 km. He then joined the NASA astronaut office in Houston and
after serving as backup commander for Gemini 5 flew in space in March
1966 as commander of the historic Gemini 8 mission which saw the first
orbital docking and the first emergency orbital spin recovery and return
to Earth. After two more backup slots on Gemini 11 and Apollo 8, his
second and last spaceflight was as commander of Apollo 11. On 1969 July
19 the Apollo 11 crew of Armstrong, Aldrin and Collins became the 7th,
8th and 9th humans to leave Earth's gravitational sphere of influence
and enter the Moon's; on July 20 Armstrong and Aldrin became the first
humans to land on another world, as Armstrong brought LM-5 Eagle to a manual
landing with only 20 seconds of fuel left. On July 21 Armstrong was the first
human to walk on the lunar surface. In 1971 he left NASA and returned to
Ohio where he taught aeronautics for several years.

Of the 24 humans who have left Earth's gravitational sphere of influence, 17
remain alive today.

Mesonauts
----------

The mesosphere is the highest layer of the Earth's atmosphere that isn't
really `outer space', and lies between the stratopause at 50 km and the
mesopause at the base of the exosphere - `true 'space - at around 80-90
km, although I adopt 80 km as a good reference value. Starting with Ham
and Yuriy Gagarin, 2 pan troglodytes and 533 humans have  passed that 80
km exospheric boundary and become space travellers; they zipped through
the mesosphere on the way. 11 humans - the `mesonauts' - have made
flights that got as far as the mesosphere but not the exosphere. 10 of
those eleven mesonauts later went on to make higher `astronaut' flights.
Only 3 of the 11 are alive today. Here are details of the first
mesospheric flights of the mesonauts as well as their their first
exospheric flights.

John B. 'Jack' McKay and William 'Pete' Knight made the most mesoflights, 7 each.

Suborbital flights
------------------

It has been reported that China carried out a test launch of a missile
on Jul 24. A media report by W. Gertz claimed that it was a new longer-range
DF-41 ICBM but it is unclear if there is any evidence for this; 
I will record it as an unknown missile for the time being.

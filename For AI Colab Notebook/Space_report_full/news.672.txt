Happy perihelion to all my readers in the Earth-Moon system!

International Space Station
----------------------------

Expedition 34 is underway with commander Kevin Ford
and flight engineers FE-1 Oleg Novitskiy and FE-2 Yevgeniy Tarelkin.
Their ferry ship, Soyuz TMA-06M, is docked at the Poisk module.

Soyuz TMA-07M (spacecraft 704A, flight ISS 33S) went up on Dec 19 with
crew Roman Romanenko of Russia, Chris Hadfield of Canada, and Tom
Marshburn of the USA. Initial orbit was 194 x 236 km x 51.6 deg.
The spaceship docked with the Rassvet module at 1409 UTC on Dec 21.

Two cargo ships are also docked: Progress M-16M at the Pirs module
and Progress M-17M at the Zvezda aft port.

OTV-3
-----

Hobbyists have located the US Air Force X-37B spaceplane in a 343 x 360
km x 43.5 deg orbit.

North Korean satellite 
----------------------

Four objects have been cataloged in orbit associated with the NK launch:
the Kwangmyongsong-3 F2 satellite, the Unha-3 rocket stage and two
debris pieces.  Optical observations by Greg Roberts in S Africa show a
16-s periodic brightening indicating the satellite is spinning or
tumbling, which is the natural state of a satellite if its  size and
shape. The satellite was thought to carry reaction wheels or some
similar three-axis stabilization system, but this does not seem to be
working at the moment. News reports describing the satellite as 'out of
control' could be premature, as it is possible that the stabilization
system is designed to be activated some time after launch. However, the
failure to pick up signals at 470 MHz by independent observers in the US
and UK, including a long-time member of the Kettering Group, Bob Christy
of http://zarya.info, is strong circumstantial evidence that the
satellite's transmitter is not working and that the satellite is most
likely dead. At this point in early January, the continuing lack of
signal reports make this conclusion all the more likely.

On Jan 1 the orbits were
   A (satellite)  497 x 581 km x 97.40 deg
   B (rocket)     496 x 589 km x 97.40 deg
   C (debris)     497 x 571 km x 97.45 deg
   D (debris)     497 x 586 km x 97.36 deg


GRAIL
-----

The two GRAIL spacecraft, Ebb and Flow, completed their gravity mapping
mission and impacted the lunar surface at 75.62N 26.63W at 2229 UTC on
Dec 17. On Dec 6 their orbit was lowered to only 15 km above the surface
for a final low-altitude data take. NASA is giving the impact region
the unofficial (non-IAU) name of 'Sally Ride Impact Site'. The name appears
to apply to the general region of the impact, which consists of the two
impact points several km apart and any associated secondary debris.
The impact velocity was 1.7 km/s. Congratulations to MIT's Maria Zuber
on an outstanding science mission.


Chang'e-2
---------

China's Chang'e-2 space probe made a remarkable 3.2 km flyby of minor planet
(4179) Toutatis on Dec 13 at 0830:09 UTC and returned images of the asteroid.
Chang'e-2 is in a 1.02 x 1.03 AU x 0.2 deg solar orbit.


Gokturk 2
---------

Gokturk is an earth observing satellite for the Turkish Defense
Ministry. The CZ-2D rocket put it in a 669 x 689 km x 98.2 deg orbit and
then made a depletion burn to a 144 x 688 km orbit. The satellite was
built by Turk Havacikik ve Uzay Sanayii (Turkish Aerospace Inc) and the
TUBITAK research council.

Ariane
-------

Arianespace launched two communications satellites on Dec 19. Skynet 5D
is an Astrium/Paradigm satellite for UK military communications;
Mexsat-Bicentenario will provide domestic Mexican communications.
The satellites reached a 263 x 25821 km x 2.0 deg geostationary transfer orbit.
On Jan 1 Skynet 5D was in GEO over 24E and Mexsat was over 114.8W.

Iranian Launch Failures
-----------------------

Discussion on nasaspaceflight.com has drawn my attention to claims by
defense analyst publication IHS Jane's that Iran had a further launch
failure on or soon after Sep 22. The failure appears to have taken place
on the pad, so it is hard to be sure that an orbital launch was
intended. Nevertheless I will include it in my lists for the time being,
to give the possible launch some visibility, until further information
should come to light that affects my assessment of it.

Yamal-402
---------

On Dec 17 the Yamal-402 satellite was in a 35693 x 35764 km x 0.05 deg orbit
drifting at 1 deg per day over the Indian Ocean at 53E, completing the recovery
effort for the satellite. It had reached a lower than planned initial orbit
after the failure of its Briz-M upper stage.


Orbital Launch Stats 2012 
--------------------------

Total 78 attempts:
Russia 24, China 19, US 16, France/ESA 10, India 2, Japan 2, Iran 1 + 2 fail?, North Korea 1+1 fail
The Iranian launch failures, as noted above, are not confirmed. This is the first year in which
the number of Chinese launches has exceeded the corresponding US total.

Suborbital flights
-------------------

The IMAGER payload developed by U Mass. Lowell's Tim Cook and BU's Meredith 
Danowski was launched from White Sands on Nov 21 for ultraviolet imaging
of the nearby spiral galaxy M101 with a 0.5m telescope.

The DXL mission launched on Dec 13 studies soft X-ray emission from the solar
wind and the local interstellar medium. The project is led by M. Galeazzi of
Miami University.

International Space Station
----------------------------

Expedition 34 is underway with commander Kevin Ford and flight engineers
FE-1 Oleg Novitskiy, FE-2 Yevgeniy Tarelkin, FE-4 Roman Romanenko, FE-5
Chris Hadfield, and FE-6 Tom Marshburn. Ferry ship Soyuz TMA-06M is
docked at the Poisk module; Soyuz TMA-07M is at Rassvet; cargo ship
Progress M-17M is at the Zvezda aft port.

Progress M-16M undocked from the Pirs module at 1316 UTC on Feb 9 and
was deorbited over the Pacific Ocean at 1619 UTC with impact of its
debris at 1705 UTC. Progress M-18M is being prepared for launch.

Naro
----

Success for South Korea as the S Korean/Russian KSLV-1 (Naro-1) rocket takes off
from Naro Space Center. After two previous launch failures the rocket is
reported to have placed its payload, STSAT-2C, in orbit. Planned orbit
was 300 x 1500 km x 80 deg; US tracking shows the payload in a 292 x 1511 km x 80.3
deg orbit, essentially perfect given possible different definitions of the
reference sphere. The payload carries a laser reflector array
for geodesy, an ionosphere instrument, and technology experiments.

Naro-1 consists of an Angara-URM first stage built by the Russian
Khrunichev company, and a solid second stage built by South Korea.
KAIST, the Korea Advanced Institute for Space Technology (based in
Daejon) developed the satellite and KARI, the Korea Aerospace Research
Institute (Han-guk Hanggong Uju Yeon-guwon) led development the launch vehicle
and carried out the launch. 

The fact that a very significant part of the rocket is Russian rather
than S Korean has led to arguments over whether S Korea is now the 13th 
(or even just 11th) country to have its own capability to launch into
orbit, or just another tourist paying for the ride.

For the record, my take is that S Korea is nation no. 11-and-a-half,
counting the European Space Agency as a quasi-nation.

The Wikipedia page credits Ukraine with a 1991 launch of Soviet/Russian
satellites by a Ukrainian-built rocket integrated in the USSR and
launched by the Soviet UNKS space troops; I don't think this should
count. The Sich launch was a Ukrainian built and owned satellite
launched by a Ukrainian built rocket which was launched by space troops
of the Russian Federation - I am inclined to count this one to Ukraine
but it's still arguable.

I consider the Russian Federation as the successor state of the USSR and
don't count it separately. Sea Launch, of course, is another tricky case
- I would count it as mostly Russian.

France's first launch was from Algerian territory; its first orbital launch from
French territory was on 1970 Mar 10. The UK launch was from Australian territory.


TDRS 
----

NASA's new-generation Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, TDRS K, was
launched on Jan 31 by a Lockheed Martin/ULA Atlas V 401 from Cape
Canaveral. The new TDRS is based on the Boeing/El Segundo HS-601
spacecraft bus. Atlas flight AV-036 entered a 183 x 24854 km x 26.5 deg
parking orbit 18 min after launch, according to data provided by Justin
Ray (spaceflightnow.com). The second burn at 0328 UTC reached a 4336 x
35791 km x 25.7 deg orbit and the Centaur separated at 0334 UTC. TDRS K
will use its R-4D propulsion system to reach geostationary orbit and
become the operational TDRS 11. By Feb 10, TDRS K was in a 35422 x 35787
km x 7.1 deg orbit over 150 deg West, drifting east at 2 deg/day.

Sea Launch
----------

A major blow to Sea Launch as their Zenit-3SL launch vehicle failed on
Feb 1. The rocket took off from the Odyssey floating launch platform at
154W, 0N on the equator, but did not follow the correct trajectory
because of a hydraulic pump failure 4 seconds after launch. The
propulsion was shut down about 24 seconds after launch, with the vehicle
falling in the Pacific at 56 seconds after launch, according to
information on the Novosti Kosmonavtiki forum. Intelsat's IS-27
communications satellite was aboard. IS-27 carried Ku and C band comms
payloads as well as a UHF payload which was to be used by the Italian
government.

Globalstar
-----------

Six Globalstar low orbit mobile-phone satellites were placed in a 918 x
926 km x 52.0 deg orbit by an Arianespace/Starsem Soyuz-2-1A rocket with
a Fregat upper stage on Feb 6. The Soyuz third stage was suborbital,
and the Fregat stage was deorbited shortly after deploying the satellites.

The Globalstar satellite serial numbers are based on preliminary
information given on the website nasaspaceflight.com and are subject to 
revision.


Ariane mission VA212
--------------------

Arianespace flew Ariane 5ECA launcher L568 on mission VA212 from Kourou on Feb 7,
placing two communications satellite in geostationary transfer orbit. The EPC 568
core stage flew a -995 x 157 x 6.0 deg path into the Atlantic; the ESC-A
upper stage put the two satellites and the Sylda adapter into a 262 x 35830 km x 6 deg
GTO.

Amazonas 3 is a Loral 1300 satellite with a launch mass of 6265 kg,
providing C and Ku band Hispamar service. Hispamar Satelites SA is a
joint venture of the Spanish Hispasat company's Brazilian subsidiary
and Brazilian carrier Oi/Telemar; the satellite is owned by the Hispasat
Group based in Madrid and is considered a Spanish satellite.

Azerspace is operated by Azercosmos for the Azerbaijan Ministry of
Communications and Information Technologies; some capacity will also be
used by Measat of Malaysia to provide services to Africa, and Measat
calls the satellite Africasat-1A.

2012 DA14
----------

Minor planet 2012 DA14, a 45-meter rock in a 0.9 x 1.1 AU x 10.3 deg solar orbit,
will pass about 27700 km from Earth at 1926 UTC on 2013 Feb 15 in a hyperbolic
27673 x -61552 km x 86.2 deg orbit (the negative apogee is a formal value derived
from continuation of the standard definition). It will pass lunar orbit inbound
at about 0240 UTC Feb 15, and outbound at 1200 UTC Feb 16. 

I have compared the rock's trajectory with that of all tracked artificial Earth
satellites for which current orbital elements are available; no satellites are at
risk, with the closest approaches at 2000 km or more for inert space junk:

These calculations are approximate and I would welcome hearing from anyone who does more
accurate computations which could correct or improve these predictions.

Suborbital launches
-------------------

NASA launched a Terrier / Improved Orion from Wallops on Jan 29 to test new lithium
release experiments. The lithium clouds glow after release and allow scientists
to track upper atmosphere winds.

The VISIONS payload, the first launch of a Talos-Terrier-Oriole-Nihka rocket, 
was launched into an aurora on Feb 7 from the Poker Flat Research Range near
Fairbanks, Alaska. The rocket replaces the Black Brant XII (Talos-Terrier-Black Brant V-Nihka)
as the highest-apogee suborbital research vehicle in NASA's sounding rocket stable.

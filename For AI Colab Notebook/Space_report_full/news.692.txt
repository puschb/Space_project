International Space Station
---------------------------

The launch of the next Cygnus freighter was delayed to January as astronauts
on the ISS prepared for spacewalks on Dec 21 and 24 to repair the failed 
Loop A thermal control system.

US EVA-24 was carried out on Dec 21 with Rick Mastracchio in spacesuit
EMU3010 and Mike Hopkins in EMU3011 (the now-repaired suit which
malfunctioned on Luca Parmitano's spacewalk). Quest was depressurized at 1157 UTC,
with hatch open at 1159 UTC and the suits on battery power at 1201 UTC.
The astronauts went to the S1 truss segment and removed Pump Module S/N 
The hatch was closed at 1724 UTC and Quest was repressurized at 1729 UTC.

US EVA-25 followed on Dec 25, with Hopkins in EMU 3005 and Mastracchio
in EMU 3011. Mastracchio's old suit 3010 was sidelined beacuse a
misconfiguration of the sublimator  at the end of the previous spacewalk
left its status in doubt. The airlock was depressurized at 1149 UTC,
hatch open at 1152, and battery power at 1153. The astronauts went to
External Stowage Platform 3 and removed spare Pump Module serial number
0006. The SSRMS robot arm moved Hopkins and the PM to the S1 truss; it
was installed at 1456 UTC and bolted in place at 1508 UTC. The
astronauts then connected ammonia fluid lines and electrical cables. One
 ammonia line initially refused to disconnect from its previous location
and then did spill some NH3 flakes in the vicinity of the spacewalkers, 
requiring some decontamination precautions on return to the airlock. The
astronauts closed the hatch at 1904 UTC and, after a 15 minute hold to
check for contamination, repressurized the airlock slowly from 1923 to
1954 UTC.

Russian spacewalk VKD-37 began with depressurization of the Pirs airlock
around 1250 UTC Dec 27 and opening of the hatch at 1301 UTC. Oleg Kotov
in Orlan-MK No. 6 and Sergey Ryazanskiy on Orlan-MK No. 4 installed two
video cameras from the Vancouver-based company UrtheCast. After
struggling with the cabling on the medium resolution camera, the
astronauts jettisoned the UrtheCast MRC cable reel at 1646 UTC, and an
obsolete space science experiment, Vsplesk, at 1754 UTC. The new
Seismoprognoz experiment launched on Progress M-21M was installed on
Zvezda to replace Vsplesk. However, at 1816 UTC it was reported that the
UrtheCast cameras were not working correctly, and the astronauts were
ordered to dismount them and bring them back inside. The spacewalk
concluded with hatch closure at 2107 UTC and repressurization around
2109 UTC.



Gaia
----

The European Space Agency's Gaia observatory was launched on Dec 19. The
2000 kg Gaia spacecraft will measure the three-dimensional positions and
velocities of galactic stars. The  problem of accurate stellar distances
has been a limiting factor in astrophysics with big uncertainties
leading to uncertain masses, luminosities and other physical properties
for all but the nearest stars; the Gaia catalog, when it is available
early next decade, will put the whole field of astrophysics on a firmer
footing. Gaia will spin around, with its two 1.5 x 0.5m silicon carbide
primary mirrors sweeping starlight across its gigapixel detector array.
The array has 106 CCDs each with 4500 x 1996 pixels. The SkyMapper array
of 7 x 2 CCDs and the 7 x 9 array of Astrometric Field CCDs will measure
positions; the 7 x 2 array of the Blue and Red photometer will pass the
light through blue and red filters to measure accurate brightness and
color; and the 4 x 3 array of the Radial Velocity Spectrometer CCDs will
sit behind a spectrograph and use the 8500A Ca II triplet spectral lines
to measure the Doppler shift of the brighter stars along the line of
sight. The angular separation of the two mirrors is precisely monitored,
to create an accurate latitude-longitude grid across the sky by
measuring angular distances between widely separated pairs of stars.

Gaia was launched by a Soyuz ST-B with upper stage Fregat-MT No. 1039
from Kourou-Sinnamary. The Soyuz reached a -681 x 180 km x 15.0 deg
suborbital path; the Fregat made a first burn to 175 x 175 km and then
reignited for a long burn from 0933 to 0949 UTC to propel Gaia to a 344
x 962690 km x 15.0 deg orbit, on its way to the Sun-Earth L2 point Gaia
will fire its own propulsion system of 6 10-N thrusters to raise apogee
to around 1.5 million km towards midnight; in a few weeks it will enter
a Lissajous orbit around the L2 point and begin observations. Gaia's
data will take years to process and will result in the best yet catalog
of galactic stars.

Mars Express
-------------

On Dec 29 at 0709 UTC, ESA's Mars Express spacecraft made a flyby 45 km
from the surface of Phobos (58 km from its center). Mars Express is in a
318 x 10518 km x 86.9 deg Martian polar orbit; congratulations to its
friendly operations team which has just celebrated ten years around the
planet!


Tupac Katari
------------

Bolivia's first communications satellite was launched on Dec 20. Tupac
Katari is named after the historical Bolivian leader Julian Apasa Nina
(Tupac Katari, 1750-1781). The Tupac Katari satellite was built by
China's CAST using a DFH-4 bus and has a mass at launch of 5100 kg. It
was launched from Xichang on a CALT Chang Zheng (Long March) 3BE into a
200 x 43890 km x 24.8 deg geostationary transfer orbit, and will be
controlled by Chinese-trained Bolivian engineers at the Amachuma ground
station.

Rodnik
------

A Rokot launch vehicle took off from Plesetsk early on Dec 25 carrying
three Rodnik low orbit communications satellites for the Russian
military into a 1480 x 1509 km x 82.5 deg orbit. They are expected to
get the codenames Kosmos-2488 to Kosmos-2490. The Briz-KM upper stage
successfully deployed the satellites and made its depletion burn
to an 1150 x 1500 km orbit, in contrast to the previous Rodnik launch
in January.

Ekspress
--------

Russia's new Ekspress AM-5 communications satellite was launched from Baykonur
on Dec 26. AM-5 uses a Reshetnev Ekspress-2000 bus with C, Ku, Ka and L-band
communications payloads developed in collaboration with the Canadian company MDA.
The launch vehicle was a Proton-M with a Briz-M upper stage (serial numbers
93541 and 99543, according to Rui Barbosa's Em Orbita site zenite.nu).
The Briz-M made four burns to deliver Ekspress AM-5 to a sub-geostationary
orbit of around 33800 x 37800 km x 0.18 deg according to a posting on
the Novosti Kosmonavtiki forum; US tracking has not yet picked it up.
It will use its on-board electric propulsion system (ion drive)
to complete the trek to GEO.

Soyuz-2-1V
----------

Russia ended the year with the first launch of a new rocket, the
Soyuz-2-1V. This new, lighter version of the Soyuz is a major redesign,
abandoning the four side-mounted conical strapon boosters that were the
R-7 family's trademark since the ICBM and Sputnik launches in 1957. The
core stage's lower section has been slightly enlarged in diameter and a
new propulsion system used - the main engine is the NK-33A based on the
NK-33 first developed (but never used) for the N-1 moon rocket in the
1970s. (An Americanized version of the NK-33, the Aerojet AJ-26, is the
main engine for Orbital's new Antares rocket). The Soyuz-2-1V second
stage is the same Blok-I stage as the existing Soyuz-2-1B, with an
RD-0124 engine. This first flight carries the optional Volga third
stage, a low-thrust orbit positioning bus derived from a spy satellite
propulsion system.

The inaugural launch of the Soyuz-2-1V on Dec 28 carried the Aist
satellite and two SKRL-756 calibration spheres. These were deployed from
a long cylindrical adapter attached to the Volga stage into a 599 x 625
km x 82.4 deg orbit. The Volga stage with its adapter was expected to be
deorbited over the South Pacific. The Soyuz second stage was left in a
259 x 594 km x 82.4 deg orbit.

GSAT-14
-------

India launched its Geostationary Satellite Launch Vehicle (GSLV)
on Jan 5, placing the GSAT-14 satellite in geostationary transfer
orbit.



Orbital launch statistics 2013
------------------------------

Russia 33 (+2 fail), USA 19, China 14(+1 fail), Europe 5, Japan 3, India
3, South Korea 1 - for a total of 78 to orbit + 3 failures to orbit
(some of the 78 also failed to reach their intended orbits). I am
counting Soyuz-at-Kourou and the Sea Launch failure as Russian. The
story of recent years has been the strong rise of China as a launching
state; but this year the noticeable thing is the return of Russia to a
dominance of the launching statistics not seen since the fall of the
USSR. This includes nine Proton launches (all but two for non-Russian
customers) and 15 Soyuz launches including two from Kourou and 8 ISS-related ones.

The year also saw 209 payloads orbited thanks to the late surge of mass
cubesat deployments; this compares with 134 payloads launched last year.
  Countries of ownership, 2013 payloads:
    USA       87
    Russia    28
    China     18
    UK        9 (arguable, assuming formal ownership of
                 two SES satellites to SES Satellite Leasing UK.)
    ESA       7
    Germany   6
    S Korea   6
    Japan     5
    India     5
    Canada    4
    Spain     3
    Argentina, Austria, Denmark, Ecuador, 
     Netherlands, Peru, Vietnam -   2 each
    Azerbaijan, Bolivia, Estonia, France, Italy,  
     Israel, Luxembourg, Mexico, Norway, Pakistan,
     Poland, Qatar, Singapore, Turkey, UAE, Ukraine,
     South Africa:                  1 each
 These 209 payloads include 51 amateur/academic, 37 business/commercial, 74 civil, 47 defense
 (there is some overlap, of course). Six of the payloads (LADEE, MOM, Maven, Chang'e-3, Yutu, Gaia)
 are now beyond Earth orbit.

Suborbital launches
-------------------

The USAF launched a Minuteman III from Vandenberg on Dec 17; Russia launched
a Yars missile from Plesetsk to Kura on Dec 24. Yars carries multiple reentry
vehicles. On Dec 27 the Russian rocket forces rounded out the year
with a reentry vehicle test on a Topol' missile launched from Kapustin
Yar to Sary-Shagan.

Errata:
 -  In JSR691 I said that Yutu is the 6th wheeled vehicle on the Moon.
It is in fact the seventh - I forgot a hand cart used on the Apollo 14 mission,
the Modular Equipment Transporter. Thanks to Henry Spencer for catching the mistake.

 -  In JSR691 I gave the Kavoshgar 1 launch date as 2008 Feb, which is when it was
announced; Igor Lissov points out that the Kavoshgar web site says the launch
was in Aban 1385, which corresponds to 2006 Oct 22 to Nov 20.

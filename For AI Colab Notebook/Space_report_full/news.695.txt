International Space Station
---------------------------

Soyuz TMA-10M undocked from Poisk at 0002 UTC Mar 11, landing in
Kazakhstan at 0324 UTC with astronauts Kotov, Hopkins and Ryazanskiy.
The undocking marked the end of Expedition 38 and the beginning of
Expedition 39, with Koichi Wakata becoming the first Japanese ISS
commander. Russian Mikhail Tyurin and American Rich Mastracchio  round
out the crew.

On Mar 25 Soyuz TMA-12M was launched into a 193 x 244 km orbit carrying
Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Skvortsov, Oleg Germanovich Artem'ev and Dr.
Steve R. Swanson. The third planned rendezvous burn at 2348 UTC was
cancelled, apparently due to a software problem, postponing the ship's
rendezvous with ISS until Mar 27. The craft was in a 297 x 333 km x 51.7
deg orbit after the problem, and maneuvered to a 414 x 425 km orbit on
Mar 26. Docking with Poisk came according to the revised plan, at 2353
UTC Mar 27. Mass of the ISS after docking was about 409 tonnes.

Note: There have been two members of the Star City cosmonaut team called
"Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Skvortsov" - the one currently in orbit, born
1966 and active since 1997, and his father, born 1942, who was a trainee
cosmonaut from 1965 to 1967 and left without making any spaceflights.
Russian names, of course, do not use the American 'Junior' convention
which would disambiguate father and son.


MH370
-----

The search for the lost Malaysian airliner, flight MH370, has involved
several satellites. It has been reported that US infrared assets (i.e.
DSP and its relatives) did not see any infrared event that could be
associated with an inflight explosion. Australian
Geospatial-Intelligence Organization analysis of Worldview-2 commercial satellite
imagery led to candidate debris in the Indian Ocean on Mar 20; successive
candidate debris fields have been seen in images from China's Gao Fen 1,
France's Spot-6 and Thailand's Thaichote/THEOS satellite. As of Mar 27
none of these leads have panned out.

One constraint on the plane's location was obtained by measuring the
light-travel-time of two-way data communication between the Inmarsat 3F1
satellite in GEO at 64.5E and  equipment aboard the plane - this gives a
distance but not a direction, leading to a wide arc-shaped search locus.
Additional analysis using the Doppler shift of the frequency gave the
component of relative speed of satellite and plane along the line
joining them; combining the information allowed analysts to narrow the
search zone to an ocean region 2300 km southwest of Australia. 

Cassini
-------

The Cassini probe, approaching periapsis 202 in orbit around Saturn,
completed the T-99 Titan flyby on Mar 6, flying 1500 km from the surface
at 1628 UTC. The flyby changed the orbit to 0.80 x 2.96 million km x
45.5 deg.

Ekspress-AT1/2
---------------

Russia's Krunichev company launched a Proton rocket on Mar 15 carrying
two satellites built by ISS Reshetnev of Krasnoyarsk for Kosmicheskaya
Svyaz (Russan Satellite Communications Co.) The Ekspress-AT1 satellite
has a mass of 1672 kg. AT2 is smaller at 1326 kg.
The satellites carry Ku-band comm payloads and will be located at 56E and 140E.
On Mar 27 AT1 was in a 35701 x 35903 km x 0.1 deg orbit drifting over 70E;
AT2 was in a 35564 x 35859 km x 0.1 deg orbit over 78E.

Aist/SKRL
---------

The objects from the Soyuz-2-1V launch of Dec 2013 (2013-078) have been reassigned:
  Object originally cataloged as 39490 (78A) is now 39493 (78D). It is the second stage rocket.
  Object originally cataloged as 39491 (78B) is unchanged. It is thought to be the SKRL-756-2 calsphere.
  Object originally cataloged as 39492 (78C) is unchanged. It is thought to be Aist-1.
  Object originally cataloged as 39493 (78D) no longer exists (last TLEs Jan 14). 
      Its orbit of 601 x 625 km was similar to 78B and may have been a tracking error of some kind.
      The extra object was a mystery at the time, so its deletion makes things match what was expected.
  Object originally cataloged as 39494 (78E) is now 39490 (78A). Thought to be SKRL-756-1 calsphere.
  New object 39494 is the Briz-M stage from the Inmarsat 5 launch, previously untracked, and now
   discovered in a 2805 x 63785 km x 27.1 deg orbit.

Ariane L571
-----------

Arianespace put two communications satellites in a 260 x 35690 km x 3.0
deg GTO on Mar 22. Both satellites are carrying out orbit raising burns
on their way to geostationary orbit. Astra 5B is a 5724 kg Airbus
Defense and Space Eurostar 3000L for SES and was in a 15373 x 35665 km x
0.8 deg orbit on Mar 27. Amazonas 4A is a 2938 kg Orbital GeoStar-2.4
for Hispasat of Spain, and was in a 27450 x 35715 km x 0.3 deg orbit on
Mar 27.

Glonass
--------

Russia's Glonass-M No. 54 (Uragan-M No.  754) navigation satellite was launched from
Plesetsk on Mar 24. It has been given the codename Kosmos-2491. The satellite was placed in
a 19128 x 19153 km x 64.8 deg orbit by the Fregat upper stage. According to information
on the Novosti Kosmonavtiki forum, the Fregat stages are using a new scheme of serial
numbers; this one is No. 112-01 according to some reports. The '112' indicates that
it is a Soyuz launch from Plesetsk for the civilian Roskosmos agency.

Suborbital missions
-------------------

NASA Flight 36.287, the Ground-to-Rocket Electrodynamics-Electrons Correlative Experiment
led by M. Samara of SWRI, was launched from the Poker Flat range in Alaska on Mar 3.

North Korea carried out short range missile tests between Feb 21 and at least Mar 16.
Most of the launches were within the atmosphere, but Scud class launches on Feb 27 and Mar 2
were probably exoatmospheric. The missiles are assumed to have carried dummy reentry vehicles.
Two larger Nodong (Rodong) missiles were launched on Mar 25.

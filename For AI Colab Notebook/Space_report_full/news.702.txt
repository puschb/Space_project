International Space Station
---------------------------

The NanoRacks cubesat deployer package remains attached to the JEM RMS robot arm
while troubleshooting continues on electrical problems with the deployer.
Four more 3U cubesats remain in the deployers while another package of 8 deployers
with 16 x 3U equivialent of cubesats sits inside Kibo (more PlanetLabs Flock-1b
satellites plus the LambdaSat, GEARRS and MicroMAS payloads).

On Sep 10 at 2301 UTC Skvortsov, Artemev and Swanson undocked from the Poisk module
in Soyuz TMA-12M. The deorbit burn at 0130 UTC Sep 11 lowered the orbit to about
-22 x 418 km followed by module separation at 0158 UTC, atmosphere entry at 0201UTC
and landing in Kazakhstan at 0223 UTC.

Expedition 41 began with undocking of Soyuz TMA-12M; the remaining ISS
crew are commander Max Suraev and flight engineers FE-5 Reid Wiseman and
FE-6 Alex Gerst. Ferry craft Soyuz TMA-13M is docked to the station.

On Sep 21 SpaceX launched the sixth Dragon cargo ship on mission CRS-4
to the ISS. This was the 13th Falcon 9 launch and the 8th such launch within
a 1 year period. The Dragon Trunk carries two packages, the ISS
RapidScat radar scatterometer science instrument and the RapidScat Nadir Adapter, which
will be installed on the SDX nadir attach point of the Columbus module's
external payload facility. The Dragon cabin carries SpinSat, an 0.56m
spherical NRL satellite to be deployed by the Kibo JEM-RMS, and the
NASA-Ames Rodent Research 1 life sciences payload with 20 mice (mus
musculus). Neither SpaceX nor NASA has revealed the mass of Dragon CRS-4
but it is probably in the 9500-10500 kg range.

According to US tracking data, Dragon was inserted into a 203 x 358 km x
51.6 deg orbit; by 1400 UTC on Sep 22 it had decayed to 204 x 349 km due
to atmospheric drag, but had not begun significant orbit raising burns
to rendezvous with the ISS. However I'm not completely sure the object
being tracked (catalog 40212 until Sep 22 1300 UTC, then retagged as
40210) is actually Dragon. 

The Falcon 9 second stage was deorbited on the first Earth revolution
and reentered S of New Zealand at about 0655 UTC Sep 21.


Maven and MOS at Mars
---------------------

The NASA/JPL Maven space probe has arrived at Mars. MAVEN was in 0.96 x
1.45 AU x 2.0 deg solar orbit until entering Mars sphere of influence at
0100 UTC Sep 20, then in 537 x -15778 km x 74 deg hyperbola. At 0138 UTC
on Sep 22 the probe began a 33 minute burn to brake into a bound 380 x
44600 km x 75 deg Mars orbit (parameters not yet confirmed).

Meanwhile, the Indian Space Research Organization's Mars Orbiter Spacecraft
entered the Mars sphere of influence from its 0.98 x 1.44 AU x 2.5 deg solar 
orbit on Sep 22.

Kobal't
-------

It now appears that something went wrong with the recovery of a Russian Defense Ministry
Kobal't spy satellite on Sep 2. (The satellite is usually called Kosmos-2495 in the press,
although the confusion about Kosmos numbering means it may actually be Kosmos-2493).

Based on the knowledge that the satellite was no longer in orbit of Sep 2, I calculated
(using algorithms pioneered by Phil Clark) that if it landed in the usual area,
the deorbit would have been northbound over the Horn of Africa around 1805 UTC Sep 2
with entry around 1818 UTC and landing around 1828 UTC near Orenburg in Russia.
The descent module (SA) would separate from the service module (AO) after the deorbit
burn, with the AO burning up since it does not have a heat shield. The AO carries
the solar panels, which are likely to break off early in the descent.

Reentering debris overhead was observed by people in Kazakhstan at
around 1814 UTC Sep 2, exactly the expected time for the service module
entry. (but also close to a pass of the Chinese Yaogan 5 satellite
wich completed its reentry two orbits later. However, Ted Molczan reports that
he has ruled out Yaogan 5 as a possibility.)

In addition, large amounts of reentering debris were observed
northbound over Colorado and Wyoming at about 0430 UTC on Sep 3, which
is consistent with the projected path and timing of the satellite if no
deorbit burn was made.

I conclude that the SA landed successfully on the Sep 2 pass; possibly
after separation the AO bounced off the atmosphere and remained in a very low
orbit for 7 further revolutions before finally succumbing over US territory.
This is hard to match with the data since the timing suggests whatever reentered
over Colorado was in the original payload orbit - there are uncertainties but
other analysts like Ted Molczan believe that the small objects (payload covers?
solar panels?) ejected before the deorbit burn were responsible for the Colorado reentry.
I'm surprised that low mass objects could generate such a bright display.
Space-Track has not cataloged any additional objects associated with the mission.

Meanwhile, Bob Christy reports that NOTAMS (announcements of airspace
closures) suggest recovery dates for the two small SpK capsules. Based
on these I infer SpK landing times of Jun 20 0808 UTC and Jul 3 0402
UTC.


Asiasat 6
---------

On Sep 7 SpaceX launched the Asiasat 6 satellite. It reached a 175 x 202
km x 27.7 deg parking orbit and then was delivered to a 154 x 35752 km x
25.4 deg geostationary transfer orbit. Asiasat is a Hong Kong based
telecom company. The satellite has C and Ku band communications payloads
and an additional C-band payload for the Thai operator Thaicom; this
payload is marketed as Thaicom 7. The Loral-1300 satellite has a mass of
3700 kg according to the press kit, although Space News quoted 4428 kg. 
On Sep 20, Asiasat 6 had reached a 35773 x 35800 km x 0.1 deg GEO over
119.8 deg E.

Yaogan 21
---------

China's Yaogan 21 imaging satellite was launched to a 475 km, 1030LTDN SSO on Sep 8.
The mission continues a series begun with the Zi Yuan 2 satellites.

A small 67 kg subsatellite, Tiantuo-2 was also deployed. The Tiantuo
satellites are built by the National University for Defense Technology;
this one carries video imaging experiments.

Ariane 5
--------

Ariane 5 flight VA218, vehicle 573, placed two communications satellites in
geostationary transfer orbit on Sep 11. Measat 3b is a 5897 kg Airbus/Toulouse Eurostar 3000
satellite for Malaysia's Measat; part of the capacity is leased to NewSat (Melbourne)
to be marketed as the Jabiru-2 payload. Optus 10 is owned by Singtel Optus,
the Australian subsidiary of Singapore Telecome. It is a 3970 kg Loral LS-1300 satellite
with a Ku-band payload.

CLIO
----

United Launch Alliance launched a Lockheed Martin Atlas V 401, flight
AV-049, on Sep 17. The rocket placed the Lockheed Martin A2100 class
CLIO satellite (USA 257) in an unusual high-perigee geostationary transfer orbit,
possibly around 11800 x 36000 km, after coasting in an initial 174? x
28860 km x 28 deg orbit.


CLIO's owner is an unidentified US government agency - possibly the
National Reconnaissance Office although nowadays its satellites are
normally acknowledged. It may have a communications or signals
intelligence payload.

Cassini
-------

At 0525 UTC Sep 22, Cassini flew 1400 km from Titan on its T-105 flyby.
Cassini is now in a 626000 x 3133000 km x 40.3 deg Saturn orbit

Dawn
----

The Dawn probe, en route from Vesta to Ceres, safemoded due to a radiation
event on Sep 11. Ion engine thrusting resumed by Sep 16; the probe is currently
in a 2.45 x 3.03 AU x 9.6 deg solar orbit, reducing aphelion and increasing
inclination on its way to Ceres arrival in 2015.

Messenger
---------

The Messenger probe, in orbit around Mercury, reached a record low orbit
of 23 x 10610 km x 83.5 deg  on Sep 12. An engine burn then raised
periapsis, making the orbit 92 x 10610 km.

Suborbital missions
-------------------

Russia launched a submarine missile on Sep 10; India carried out a training launch
of its Agni I missile on Sep 11. Three Trident missiles were launched from off the
coast of Southern California Sep 12 towards the mid-Pacific, from an unidentified Trident submarine;
at least one of the launches was widely observed along the US west coast.

Israel carried out a missile defense test Sep 9; according to the Times of Israel the
target was a Blue Sparrow missile which is thought to fly a slightly exoatmospheric
trajectory, although the Arrow 2 interceptor itself would not have left the atmosphere.

LVDB

The orbital/suborbital launch vehicle database http://planet4589.org/space/lvdb/ has been updated.


International Space Station
---------------------------

Expedition 41 is underway with commander Max Suraev and flight engineers FE-5 Reid Wiseman and
FE-6 Alex Gerst. On Sep 25 at 2025 UTC the Soyuz TMA-14M ferry ship was launched
from Baykonur with the remaining Ex-41 crewmembers FE-1 Aleksandr Samokutyaev, FE-2 Elena Serova
and FE-3 Barry 'Butch' Wilmore. The port solar array failed to deploy after Soyuz separated
from the launch vehicle third stage, but this did not impact the rendezvous. Soyuz TMA-14M
docked with the Poisk module at 0211 UC Sep 26. Serova is the fourth Russian woman in space
and the first since 1997.

Dragon CRS-4 has arrived at ISS. The SSRMS Canadarm-2 grappled it at 1052 UTC Sep 23
and berthed it to the Harmony node at 1321 UTC.

The NanoRacks cubesat deployer package was returned to the Kibo airlock on Sep 16
following trouble with the deployments. The problems have been traced to incorrectly
tightened screws, and replacement deployers are expected to be sent to ISS.

Astronauts Wiseman and Gerst made US spacewalk EVA-27 on Oct 7. The airlock was depressurized
at about 1225 UTC and repressurized at 1843 UTC. The failed Pump Module, serial number 04, which was stowed
on the Mobile Base System's POA mount during an EVA on 2013 Dec 21, was relocated to External
Stowage Platform 2. A new unit called the Mobile Transporter Relay Assembly (MTRA) was
attached to the transporter to provide backup power. I'm not sure what flight the MTRA was launched on.
Wiseman used EMU 3010 and Gerst used EMU 3003.

On Oct 15 Wiseman and Wilmore made spacewalk EVA-28. They replaced the SSU (Sequential Shunt Unit)
on solar wing 3A, attached to the S4 truss, and worked on external cameras and electronics.
The replacement SSU has been on the ISS for some time; again, I'm not sure which launch it
went up on; I'm also not certain which EMUs were used for this EVA.

Kosmos reentry over Colorado
-----------------------------

Ted Molczan remarked on the discussion in the last JSR that his analysis shows
that a relatively small piece of debris (50-100 kg class compared to the multi tonne
Kosmos satellite) matches the visual observations from the Colorado area,
and that the timing is more consistent with an object ejected just prior to the
Sep 2 deorbit burn with drag properties similar to other Kobal't-M ejected
debris. I find his analysis convincing; it is still unclear exactly what the ejected debris
from Kobal't-M satellites is, but my best guess remains the solar panels.


X-37B
-----

The third X-37B mission, launched in 2012 Dec, is expected to land
shortly after almost two years in space. On May 5 it was observed to
still be in a 382 x 405 km x 43.5 deg orbit, similar to the parameters
achieved a few months after launch. However between then and early
October it made several orbit lowering burns; it was last observed on
Oct 6 in a 259 x 285 km orbit. As of Oct 17 its orbital lifetime was 674
days.

The record durations in space for vehicles that have been recovered on Earth are:

     Hayabusa               7.1 years
     Stardust               6.9 years

Luch
----

The Khrunichev Proton launch vehicle returned to flight Sep 27, launching the Luch
satellite for the Russian Defense Ministry. The satellite is built by ISS Reshetnev.
Earlier-generation Luch satellites were used for data relay, analogously to the NASA
TDRS and NRO SDS systems.  On Oct 16 Luch was in a 35796 x 35896 km x 0.0 deg orbit
drifting west over 54 deg E.

SJ-11
-----

China launched the 7th satellite in the Shi Jian 11 constellation on Sep
28 into a 686 x 705 km x 98.1 deg orbit. 'Shi Jian Shiyihao 07 xing' was
placed in an 1130 local time sun-synchronous orbit. This is one of the
larger Chinese military satellite constellations and remains mysterious;
the speculation that it carries infrared missile warning sensors remains
unconfirmed.

Himawari-8
----------

A Mitsubishi Heavy Industries H-IIA rocket placed the Japan Meteorological Agency's
Himawari-8 weather satellite in geostationary transfer orbit Oct 7. On Oct 15
the satellite was in a 35756 x 35813 km x 0.1 deg orbit over 140.8E.

IRNSS
------

India's PSLV-XL rocket launched the country's third dedicated navigation
satellite  on Oct 16. The 1425 kg  IRNSS-1C was launched to a
subsynchronous transfer orbit of 271 x 20600 km x 17.9 deg.


Ariane 5
---------

Ariane mission VA220, vehicle 574, launched two communications satellites to GTO on Oct 16.
Payloads were the Intelsat/DirectTV joint venture, IS-30/ISDLA-1; and Argentina's first domestic GEO
comsat, ARSAT-1. IS-30's Ku-band payload is leased to DirectTV as DLA-1 for broadcast to
Latin America.


Chinese UN registration
-----------------------

China recently submitted satellite registration information to the UN
for satellites launched between Jan 2012 and Mar 2014. They registered
33 satellites, but  failed to register 11: the two spaceflights Shenzhou
9 and 10, the secret military satellite Kuaizhou-1, the Hong Kong based
ABS-2, and several secondary payloads: Tiantuo-1, Fengniao-1, XY-1,
Yaogan 16 subsats 1 and 2, and Yaogan 17 subsats 1 and 2. This low level
of compliance is disappointing, since earlier Chinese registrations
were much more complete.

Galileo/Soyuz and Proton failures
---------------------------------

Russian officials report that the failure of the Fregat stage during
the Aug 22 Galileo launch was caused when a cryogenic helium line
installed too close to a hydrazine propellant supply
line caused the hydrazine to freeze. The root cause, according to Arianespace,
was a design error that failed to require thermal separation of the lines
(and so, specifically, not a quality control error as previously suggested).
The failure of a Proton third stage in May is reported to have occurred when a turbopump
attachment bracket suffered structural failure - the statement is less clear
this time whether or not the this was due to poor workmanship.

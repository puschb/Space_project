International Space Station
---------------------------

Expedition 41 is underway with commander Max Suraev and flight engineers 
FE-1 Aleksandr Samokutyaev, FE-2 Elena Serova,
FE-3 Barry 'Butch' Wilmore. FE-5 Reid Wiseman and FE-6 Alex Gerst.

The Dragon CRS-4 cargo ship was unberthed at about 1202 UTC Oct 25 and released by
the SSRMS at 1357 UTC. It made its deorbit burn at 1843 UTC and splashed down
in the Pacific at 1938 UTC off Baja California (near 34N 123.5W according to 
Bob Christy's zarya.info, 30.7N 121.3W according to estimates by user Avron
on nasaspaceflight.com based on maritime traffic; SpaceX have not revealed
an accurate splashdown location).

Progress M-24M undocked from Pirs at 0538 UTC Oct 27. Progress M-25M was
launched at 0709 UTC on Oct 29 and docked with Pirs at 1308 UTC the same
day.

The Orbital Cygnus Orb-3 cargo ship was destroyed during launch from the
Mid Atlantic Regional Spaceport (MARS) Pad 0A at Wallops Island,
Virginia on Oct 28. The lower end of the Antares 130 vehicle exploded 14
seconds after launch at an altitude of about 100 metres, and the vehicle
and payloads fell back to the pad, resulting in a large explosion. As
well as ISS cargo, the Orb-3 mission was carrying 26 PlanetLabs Flock-1d
3U cubesats, the JPL/U-Texas RACE 3U cubesat, the Arkyd-3 3U cubesat
from Planetary Resources, and also the GOMX-2 ship tracking
2U cubesat from GOMX of Aalborg, Denmark. All of the payloads were
destroyed. The first stage of Antares 130 is built by Yuzhnoe (Ukraine)
and derived from the Zenit tankage; the engines are Aerojet AJ-26
models, which are refurbished/modernized Kuznetsov NK-33s left over from
the Soviet N-1 human lunar landing program. It is not yet clear what the
cause of the failure was, although I note the rocket appeared to be
flying normally until a large flash was seen near the base of the
rocket, suggesting some kind of problem in the first stage propulsion
system as a likely suspect (although a first stage tank structural or plumbing
failure is also a possibility).

Since there seems to be some confusion on this point, I recall to
readers  that although commercial space station cargo ships (the thing
on top of the rocket) are something new, commercial space launch
vehicles (the rocket itself) are not, and indeed have been the norm in
the US civilian space program since the early 1990s when NASA
transferred Atlas and Delta launches to the private sector and retired
the Scout in favor of buying small satellite launches from Orbital's
Pegasus. There have been no orbital NASA launches since then with the
exception of the Shuttle.

Ekspress AM-6
--------------

The Russian Satellite Communication Company (Kosmicheskiya Svyaz)'s
Ekspress AM-6 satellite was launched from Baykonur on Oct 21. US
tracking confirms earlier  rumours on the Novosti Kosmonavtiki forum
that the final Briz-M burn was incomplete, leaving the satellite in an
orbit with a 1373 min period - significantly below the planned orbit,
but probably close enough for Ekspress AM-6 to reach its GEO destination
using extra xenon propellant from its own electric propulsion system at
the cost of operational lifetime.

Ekspress AM-6 orbit is 1373.2 min, 31307 x 37784 km x 0.7 deg; the
Briz-M's auxiliary SOZ thrusters disposed of the stage into a 1512.4
min, 34984 x 39549 km x 1.0 deg orbit.


Chinese lunar mission
----------------------

On Oct 23 a Chang Zheng 3C/G2 launch vehicle took off from Xichang and placed
a spacecraft in a 209 x 413000 km lunar transfer orbit. The spacecraft
is called 'Chang'e wu hao feixing shiyan qi', or CE-5 Flight Test Device.
The vehicle is a precursor to the planned Chang'e-5 mission and consists
of a satellite bus similar to the Chang'e-2 lunar orbiter, topped with
a reentry vehicle which appears to be a miniature Shenzhou landing module.
The craft will make an 8-day flight to loop around the Moon and return to Earth.
Calculations by user 'satwatcher' on the nasaspaceflight.com forum indicate
that lunar closest approach was Oct 27 1903 UTC at a height of 11300 km.
The vehicle is expected to land in China around 2230 UTC Oct 31.

LuxSpace's 4M (Manfred Memorial Moon Mission) amateur radio payload
is attached to the third stage of the CZ-3C. Following lunar flyby
on Oct 27, the stage is in a 141090 x 416326 km x 54.2 deg orbit.

SJ11-08
-------

The 8th and final satellite in the somewhat mysterious Shi Jian 11 series
was launched by Chang Zheng 2C on Oct 27 as China's October launch surge continues.
The satellite entered a 688 x 703 km SSO with 1315 local time descending node.
It is believed to be a military surveillance satellite of some kind.

Meridian
--------

The Meridian No. 17L communications satellite (7th in the series) for the Russian
Ministry of Defense was launched on a Soyuz-2-1a/Fregat from Plesetsk on Oct 30
into a 968 x 39750 km x 62.8 deg 'Molniya'-type orbit.


GPS
---

GPS satellite vehicle SVN 69, flight IIF-8, nicknamed Spica, was launched
on Atlas V serial AV-050 from Cape Canaveral on Oct 29. It reached a 167 x 20281 km
transfer orbit 17 minutes after launch; the Centaur restarted at 2040 UTC to
place the GPS IIF-8 mission in a 20456 x 20464 km x 55.0 deg orbit.


X-37B
-----

X-37B flight vehicle 1 completed its second flight on Oct 17, landing at
Vandenberg AFB at 1624 UTC after 674.9 days in space.

 Satellite Retrievals
 --------------------

In the last JSR I gave a list of spacecraft which landed back on Earth
after spending long times in space. Here I give a table of spacecraft or
parts of spacecraft which were brought back to Earth aboard other
spacecraft - so, not needing reentry systems of their own. All the
entries in this list were Shuttle retrievals, except for a few low-mass
recovered experiments on Soyuz missions (only the longest-duration two
are noted) and the leading entries are all parts of the Hubble Space
Telescope. 

(As usual, I solicit corrections and additions to this list).

UN Registration
---------------

Congratulations to Norway which has registered its remaining satellites with the
UN (except for the recently launched AISSat-2).  Norway's registered satellites are the
Thor 2,3, 5 and 6 communications satellites and the NCUBE-2 and AISSat-1 satellites in
polar orbit. I plan to update the on-line table of registrations once the UN Office
of Outer Space Affairs have made public recent outstanding filings by Russia and the USA.

International Space Station
---------------------------

Expedition 46 continues aboard ISS with Scott Kelly, Mikhail Kornienko, Sergey Volkov,
Yuriy Malenchenko, Tim Kopra and Tim Peake.

The AggieSat-4 satellite was ejected from the ISS on Jan 29 using the Kibo JRMS arm and the
SSIKLOPS deployer. The 55 kg AggieSat-4, developed by students at Texas A&M University, will
eject the 3U cubesat Bevo-2 (from students at U. Texas-Austin) and perform formation flying
experiments with it.

On Feb 3 astronauts Malenchenko and Volkov carried out spacewalk VKD-42 from the Pirs module.
The hatch was opened at 1255 UTC and closed at 1740 UTC. They retrieved the EXPOSE-R2
and SKK 2-M2 materials exposure experiments and installed SKK 3-M2 and two Vinoslivost panels.
They also jettisoned a small package consisting of a bag of towels attached to a commemorative
flash drive with videos about World War II to celebrate the 70th anniversary of 'Victory Day'.
The inert package will reenter in a few days or weeks.

Erratum: the Cygnus OA-4 cargo ship is berthed at the nadir port on Unity, not Harmony.

ASTRO-H
-------

Congratulations to my ISAS colleagues on the successful launch of the
ASTRO-H X-ray astronomy observatory on Feb 17. ASTRO-H rode H2A No. 30
from Japan's Tanegashima Space Center to a low Earth orbit. It carries
an array of five X-ray telescopes.

The SXT-1 soft-X-ray telescope operates in the 0.3-12 keV range and has the SXI
(Soft X-ray Imager) camera at its focus; this uses a conventional (but improved)
6.5-megapixel X-ray CCD imager similar to those used on Suzaku, Chandra and XMM.
SXT's angular resolution is about 100 arcseconds, compared to Chandra's
fraction of an arcsecond, so the pictures will be relatively blurry, although
SXT-1/SXI has better senstivity at higher energies than Chandra does.

The SXT-2 soft X-ray telescope has similar optics but at its focus is 
the SXS (Soft X-ray Spectrometer), which failed on its previous mission aboard
ASTRO-E-II/Suzaku. SXS is an X-ray calorimeter cooled to 50 milliKelvin to provide
super-high spectral resolution, and it's a technology that X-ray astronomers
have been trying to fly since the 1990s.

HXT-1 and HXT-2, two hard X-ray telescopes operating from 5 to 80 keV, have
a 12-metre focal length requiring their HXI cameras to be mounted on an extensible
optical bench which deploys after launch. The HXIs use a new technology, with a layer
of DSSD (double-sided silicon strip) and a layer of CdTe cross-strip detectors
to pick up different energy ranges.

Finally the SGD, or soft gamma-ray detector, picks up photons in the 40 to 600 keV
energy range. It doesn't have a focussing telescope and will only be able to
locate soft gamma ray emission to within half a degree or so.

JAXA/ISAS has named the satellite 'Hitomi' (eye-pupil), despite the fact
that another currently operating satellite from the nearby University of Tokyo
already has that name. 

IRNSS
-----

India launched its 5th navigation satellite on Jan 20. The PSLV-XL
delivered it to a subsynchronous transfer orbit. By early February it
was in an inclined synchronous orbit at 35697 x 35874 km x 28.1 deg.
IRNSS-R1C is in an near-equatorial orbit at 83E; the remainder are in
the 28 degree inclined orbits, with R1A and R1B over about 55E and R1D
and R1E over about 112E.

LISA Pathfinder
---------------

LISA Pathfinder is now in the vicinity of Sun-Earth L1. The propulsion module
was jettisoned at 1130 UTC Jan 22; it will probably end up in solar orbit.
LPF uncaged its test masses on Feb 16.

Intelsat 29e
------------

Arianespace placed the IS-29e communications satellite in a
low-inclination geotransfer orbit on Jan 27. IS-29e carries C, Ku and
Ka-band communications payload and is the first of Intelsat's new
broadband high-throughput 'Epic-NG' series, built by Boeing using the
BSS-702MP bus. Launch mass was 6552 kg.

Eutelsat 9B
-----------

International Launch Services and Khrunichev flew a Proton from Baykonur
on Jan 29 placing the Eutelsat 9B satellite in geotransfer. The European
communications operator Eutelsat will use the satellite's 66 Ku-band
transponders to increase performance at the 9 degrees East location. The
satellite also carries a European Space Agency  laser communications
package, EDRS-A, as part of the European Data Relay System. EDRS will
relay data from low-orbiting satellites, converting an optical
communications signal from the satellite to a Ka-band radio downlink.

Glonass-M
---------

Glonass-M No. 51 (Uragan-M 751, Kosmos-2514) was launched on Feb 7 from
Plesetsk to supplement the Russian navigation constellation.

KMS-4
------

North Korea's National Aerospace Development Administration (NADA, Kukga
uju gaebalkuk) carried out its second successful satellite launch on Feb
7 from the Sohae base. The satellite, Kwangmyongsong-4, entered a 500 km
polar orbit like the KMS-3-2 satellite launched in 2012. It appears both
satellite and launch vehicle are very similar to the 2012 mission. The
launch vehicle this time carries the name 'Kwangmyongsong' but appears
to be essentially identical to the Unha-3 launched in 2012. As of Feb 17, hobbyist
observers have not picked up any radio signals from it (there was some
early confusion due to signals from a European METOP satellite in a
similar orbit.)

NROL-45
-------

On Feb 10 ULA launched a Delta 4 with the USA 267 satellite for the US
National Reconnaissance Office. The launch was designated NRO L-45.
The USA 267 payload has been observed in a 1078 x 1085 km orbit
with a retrograde 123 degree inclination, characteristic of the TOPAZ
radar imaging satellites.

Sentinel-3A
-----------

A Eurockot/Krunichev Rokot (UR-100N missile with Briz-KM upper stage)
was launched from Plesetsk on Feb 16. The Briz-KM entered a 153 x 785 km
transfer orbit followed by an 802 x 806 km target orbit, deploying the
Sentinel-3A satellite. It then lowered perigee to 411 x 744 km to reduce
orbital lifetime.

ESA's Sentinel-3A is part of the European Union's Copernicus remote
sensing program, and carries an ocean color imaging payload and an
ocean-topography radar altimeter payload.



Erratum
-------

In the last issue the China launch statistics should have read 17 CZ2/3/4 launches, not 16.

Table of Recent Suborbital Launches
-----------------------------------

Blue Origin reflew the second NS propulsion module to 101.7 km on Jan 22 and successfully
landed it. The crew capsule separated near apogee and was recovered by parachute. It's
not clear whether this was the same crew capsule as in earlier flights.

International Space Station
---------------------------

Expedition 47 continues with  commander Tim Kopra and flight engineers
Yuriy Malenchenko, Tim Peake, Alexey Ovchinin, Oleg Skripochka and Jeff Williams.

Progress M-29M was deorbited on Apr 8, reentered around 1416 UTC over the S Pacific.

Dragon CRS-8 arrived at the capture point 10m from the Harmony module at
1115 UTC Apr 10. The Canadarm-2 grappled it at 1123 UTC and berthed it
on Harmony's nadir CBM port at 1357 UTC. At about 0600 UTC on Apr 16 the
BEAM module was extracted from Dragon's trunk; BEAM was installed on the
Tranquility module's aft port at 0937 UTC Apr 16.

On Apr 27 the 50 kg Diwata-1 satellite, launched on Cygnus OA-6, was removed from the Kibo
airlock by the JRMS arm and released into orbit. Diwata-1 is an Earth observation
satellite developed by the Phillipines.

CRS-8 was unberthed at 1102 UTC May 11 and released into space at 1319 UTC.
After a deorbit burn at 1801 UTC it splashed down around 120.1W 31.4N, off
the coast of California, at 1851 UTC.

A series of Cubesat deploys from the Kibo module began on May 16
with MinXSS (U of Colorado), CADRE (U Michigan), STMSat-1 (St. Thomas More School),
and Nodes 1 and 2 (NASA-Ames). MinXSS carries a miniature X-ray solar spectrometer
to study the hard X-ray spectra of solar flares. On May 17 deployment began
of the PlanetLabs Flock-2e series (launched on OA-4) and Flock-2e-Prime (launched
on OA-6).

Sentinel-1B
-----------

On Apr 25 Arianespace flight VS14 launched a Soyuz ST-A from the ELS pad
at CSG Sinnamary. The Fregat stage first burn reached an initial orbit
of 695 x 700 km and deployed the Sentinel-1B radar imaging satellite for
ESA. It then made a burn to 442 x 690 km and deployed three 1U cubesats:
OUFTI-1 for the University of Liege, AAUSAT-4 for Aalborg University in
Denmark, and E-St@r-II for the Politecnico di Torino. The ASAP-S adapter
was ejected into the same orbit. Next, the Fregat stage made two more
burns to reach 711 x 714 km and released the Microscope satellite.
Operated by the French space agency CNES, Microscope uses the Myriade
bus and contains drag-free test masses to test the Equivalence
Principle. Finally, at 0118 UTC, Fregat made a deorbit burn and reentered over
the S Atlantic.

Signals from all three cubesats were being recieved as of May 4.


Lomonosov
---------

The Lomonosov (Mikhailo-Lomonosov-300) science satellite was orbited on Apr 28
from the new Vostochniy spaceport.  The old GIK-2 (2nd State Test Cosmodrome)
at Svobodniy was shut down in 2007; its reopening as Vostochniy marks a planned shift
away from the Kazakhstan launch site of Baikonur.

Lomonosov's main experiment, TUS, is an ultraviolet camera to observe the flashes
from cosmic rays hitting the Earth's upper atmosphere.
The Samara State Aerospace University's AIST-2D imaging satellite and its Kontakt-Nanosputnik
(Samsat-218/D) cubesat were also deployed. However, the student-built Samsat-218/D
failed to transmit properly.

IRNSS-1G
--------

Launch of the IRNSS-1G completes India's 7-satellite navigation constellation and marks
the third Indian launch this year.

SJ-10
-----

The Shi Jian-10 microgravity satellite's reentry vehicle separated from
the service module on Apr 18 at 0815 UTC and landed in China at 0830 UTC.
The service module remains in a 253 x 269 km orbit, recataloged as a new object.
It adjusted its orbit on Apr 22 but as of May 18 had not made further maneuvers.

JCSAT-14
--------

Sky Perfect JSAT's JCSAT 14 satellite, an SSL-1300 comms platform built by SSL-MDA,
was launched by Falcon 9 on May 6 into geotransfer orbit. The Falcon 9
first stage landed downrange on the SpaceX droneship Of Course I Still Love You.

  Each of the JCSAT series satellites has two names - essentially, a name that
identifies the physical satellite and a name that marks the service it is providing
at a specific orbital slot. Here is the JCSAT series:

Cassini
-------

On May 6 the Cassini probe carried out the T-119 flyby of Titan, passing
971 km from that world at 1656 UTC. The flyby changed Cassini's orbit
around Saturn from 442000 x 3310000 km x 28.8 deg for orbit 235 to
545000 x 3210000 km x 36.0 deg on orbit 236. The next Titan flyby is
T-120, at 1407 UTC Jun 7 following orbit 236 periapsis.


Simorgh
-------

The Washington Free Beacon, a conservative media outlet with sources in
the US defense establishment, reports that Iran's new Simorgh launch
vehicle failed in its initial launch attempt on Apr 19. However, Russian
sources quoted in the Kommersant newspaper suggest that it was a
successful suborbital test flight of the rocket.

Table of Recent Suborbital Launches
-----------------------------------

On Apr 26 the Chinese Academy of Sciences launched a suborbital science
payload, Kunpeng-1B, from its Hainan sounding rocket station. This is a
small facility at 109 07E 19 31 N, on the other side of Hainan from the
new Wenchang Space Center. The TY-3F sounding rocket has a booster stage
added to the earlier single-stage Tianying design, to increase its
apogee (similar to the Terrier booster used to increase apogee of the
Black Brant in its Black Brant 9 configuration).

Jonathan's Space Report 
No. 726                                                  2016 May 30 Somerville, MA

International Space Station
---------------------------

Expedition 47 continues with  commander Tim Kopra and flight engineers
Yuriy Malenchenko, Tim Peake, Alexey Ovchinin, Oleg Skripochka and Jeff
Williams.

The Nanoracks NRCSD-7 cubesat deploys were completed on May 18 with the
release of four Lemur-2 satellites from Spire Global. The Lemur system
carries AIS and GPS radio occultation meteorology payloads. The
distortion of the radio signal from a GPS satellite as it passes through
the Earth's atmosphere and out again to the STRATOS detector on Lemur-2
depends on the temperature, pressure and humidity of the region of the
atmosphere the signal is passing through - so STRATOS can infer the
weather. Lemur's SENSE payload contributes to the network of automatic
identification of shipping (AIS), relaying position and identification
data from ships at sea.

The four satellites, built in Glasgow, are named  Theresacondor, Kane,
Nick-Allain and Jeff after Spire employees. (Theresa Condor is VP
Corp.Development for Spire. Nick Allain is their director of brand. Kane
is probably named after Megan Kane, a Spire manager, and Jeff is
possibly Spire satellite engineer Jeff Kuehne.)

The two Nanoracks Cubesat Dispensers launched on OA-4 (Dec 2015, NRCSD-7)
and OA-6 (Mar 2016, NRCSD-8) were stored on ISS until May and repacked
to allow the high priority Dove 0D-class and Spire Global Lemur satellites
to be deployed sooner:

            Lemur-2 5 to 9               Flock-2e 5 to 12

In addition there is an external deployer on OA-6 which I suspect
contains Flock 2e' 13 to 20 and possibly 8 more Lemur-2s. It will
be used after OA-6 departs the ISS in June.

The MinXSS and Nodes cubesats released on May 16 are communicating with
the ground, as are the Flock-2e/2e' satellites (whose deployment order
has been corrected in the table below thanks to Mike Safyan of
PlanetLabs). No signals have been reported from CADRE or STMSat-1. The
empty NRCSD-7 cubesat deployer was brought back inside in late May and
replaced by NRCSD-8, loaded with 8 Flock 2e and 8 Flock 2e'. NRCSD-8 was
probably stowed in the Kibo ELM-PS storeroom in the interim. The NRCSD is
mounted on a table called MPEP (multipurpose experiment platform) and put
in the Kibo airlock. The Japanese JEM-RMS robot arm then picks up the MPEP
and points the NRCSD in the right direction to spring-eject its satellites,
two 3U cubesats at a time. On May 30 deploys began from NRCSD-8.

The CRS-8 Dragon which landed on May 11 brought back to Earth the EMU
3011 spacesuit implicated in the Parmitano and Kopra water leaks. EMU
3011 was launched into space on mission STS-132 in 2010. Also brought
back aboard CRS-8 were the Flock-2b 11 and 12 cubesats which failed to
deploy from the ISS last October. Nanoracks deployers NRCSD-5 and
NRCSD-6 were also returned to Earth on CRS-8.  

The Bigelow Expansion Activity Module (BEAM) remains attached to Node 3.
On May 28 the module expansion was successfuly carried out; the process
of expanding and pressurizing the module took from 1305 to 2044 UTC. The
diameter of the module is now 3.2metres; its length was increased by
1.8m to about 3.7m. 

Galileo and Glonass
-------------------

Two more Galileo satellites were launched on May 24 to join the European
navigation system. The satellites are nicknamed Daniele and Alizee.

Russia launched Glonass-M No. 53 to replenish their navigation satellite
system on May 29.

Thaicom 8
---------

SpaceX launched the Thaicom-8 satellite to a high apogee
supersynchronous transfer orbit on May 27. The Falcon 9 first stage
landed safely on the 'Of Course I Still Love You' in the Atlantic.

The Thaicom satellites mainly use the 78.5E geostationary location:

ZY-3 launch
-----------

The ZY-3 02 satellite (ziyuan san hao 02 xing) was launched from Taiyuan
on May 30 for China's Satellite Surveying and Mapping Applications Center.
It carries 2-meter-resolution Earth imaging cameras. Two small 37 kg
imaging satellites for Satellogic of Argentina were also deployed;
Ã‘USAT-1 and -2 (not to be confused with the 1985 Nusat satellite
from Weber State Univ.) are also called Fresco and Batata (cheese and sweet
potato, a popular Argentine dessert pairing).

Table of Recent Suborbital Launches
-----------------------------------

A US missile defense test on May 17 involved the launch of a
medium-range target using an SR-19 solid motor first stage.

HiFire-5B was a joint US/Australian hypersonic-research flight test from
Woomera on May 18. Some reports said it was going to use a Terrier Mk
70/Lynx rocket (following the partial failure of HF-5 from Andoya in
2012) but a spokesperson at the U. of Queensland tells me it was moved
back to the originally planned VS-30/Orion.  Thanks to T. Schiller for
alerting me to these launches.

The Indian Space Research Organization launched an HS9 booster on May 23
carrying the RLV-TD hypersonic experiment; the vehicle's apogee of 70 km
was within the mesosphere, so it's not included in the list here.

The Washington Free Beacon reports that the US DoD detected a test launch
of Russia's Nudol' antiballistic missile interceptor on May 25.

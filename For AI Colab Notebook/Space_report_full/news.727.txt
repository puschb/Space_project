International Space Station
---------------------------

On Jun 18 Expedition 47 crew members Yuriy Malenchenko, Tim Kopra and Tim
Peake transferred from the Rassvet module to Soyuz TMA-19, closing hatches
at 0235 UTC and undocking at 0552 UTC. Soyuz TMA-19M made its deorbit
burn at 0822 UTC and reentered for a safe landing in Kazakhstan at 0915 UTC.

At 0552 UTC Jun 18 Expedition 48 formally began with commander Jeff Williams
and flight engineers Alexey Ovchinin and Oleg Skripochka.

The Nanoracks NRCSD-8 successfully completed ejecting its cubesats on
Jun 2. On Jun 14 the Canadarm-2 unberthed Cygnus OA-6 from the Unity
module at 1143 UTC and released it into orbit at 1330 UTC. Cygnus then
performed the SAFIRE-1 experiment igniting a significant fire inside an
experiment chamber in the Cygnus pressurized PCM module. Mounted on the
Cygnus service module was the first NRCSD-E external cubesat deployer
carrying 5 Lemur-2 satellites. On Jun 21 two pairs of Lemur-2 cubesats
were ejected (the deployment times have not been revealed). A third
deployer silo with a single Lemur-2 failed to open, and the cubesat
remained inside when then following day Cygnus made its deorbit burn and
reentered over the South Pacific at 1329 UTC Jun 22.

Progress MS-01 undocked from the Pirs module at 0536 UTC on Jul 1, backed off
to 180m, and redocked at 0605 UTC under TORU remote control. During redocking
there was an incorrect thruster firing that made the vehicle swing visibly
from side to side. The problem is reportedly under investigation but did not
affect Progress MS-01's final undocking, which happened at 0348 UTC Jul 3.
Progress MS-01 was deorbited and destroyed over the South Pacifc at 0750 UTC Jul 3.

Soyuz MS-01 was launched on Jul 7 into a 181 x 239 km orbit; it is
scheduled to dock with the ISS on Jul 9. The Soyuz MS is a new variant
of the ferry ship with upgraded onboard systems. Crew are Anatoliy
Ivanishin (Roscosmos), Takuya Onishi (JAXA) and Kate Rubins (NASA).


IS-31
-----

The Intelsat IS-31 satellite with the DirecTV Latin America 2 (DLA-2)
Ku-band payload was launched on an ILS Proton on Jun 9 into
supersynchronous transfer orbit. The Proton second stage suffered an
early shutdown of one of its 4 engines, leaving the vehicle 28m/s slow
at stage 3 separation. Fortunately the Briz-M stage was able to correct
the problem by adjusting its burn times and delivered the satellite to
the correct orbit.

Delta 4 Heavy
-------------

A Delta 4H was launched from Cape Canaveral on Jun 11 on the NROL-37
mission to carry a large signals intelligence (SIGINT) satellite, USA
268, to geostationary orbit over the Indian Ocean.

There have been two main lineages of GEO SIGINT satellites operated by
the US National Reconnaissance Office: MERCURY (originally CANYON); and
RHYOLITE (later AQUACADE), which was replaced in the 1980s by ORION
(whose other rumoured codenames include MAGNUM and MENTOR). Launches of
the MERCURY series ended in 1998, at which time it was rumoured that its
capabilites would be merged into the ORION series. A number of observers
have suggested that the 2014 GEO SIGINT launch of USA 250 on an Atlas V
was a one-off mission not part of the ORION series, and that with an
increase in mass ORION has moved to using the RS-68A-powered Delta 4
Heavy rockets. 

It has further been suggested that the 2014 launch might be the NEMESIS
2 satellite mentioned in leaked FY2013 budget documents; however a close
reading of those documents shows that funding for the latter project was
cut off after FY2011, which to me implies that it was either launched by
then or cancelled (more likely given the sudden drop from
half-billion-dollar-level funding to zero). The documents also mention
SHARP, the SIGINT High Altitude Replenishment Program, funded at a high
level in FY2011-2013 and reportedly also since. It's possible the 2012
and 2016 launches may represent a new ORION/SHARP series, or that they
are beefed up ORION and the 2014 launch is a SHARP prototype. The
shorter fairing used for the 2014 launch suggests that it was not in
fact an ORION; the following list is based on that assumption but later
revision may be needed.

Here, then, are the ORION series launches:
  Mission    Official  Launch Date     Rocket                 Orbital Location
  (my guess) codename

Beidou
------

Beidou Daohang Weixing 23 is the 7th geostationary satellite in the
Beidou-2 generation. It was launched Jun 12.

Falcon 9
---------

Falcon 9 vehicle 26 flew on Jun 15. The second stage made two burns to deliver a pair
of Boeing BSS-702SP satellites to supersynchronous transfer orbits. This is the second
matched pair of all-electric-propulsion payloads, which use ion engines to complete
the trip to GEO. ABS-2A will supplement Asia Broadcast Satellite's ABS-2, and Eutelsat
117 West B (the former Satmex 9) will provide service for Eutelsat Americas, supplementing
Satmex 8 (now renamed Eutelsat 117 West A).


Ariane 5
--------

Ariane 5 vehicle L584 put two communications satellites in geotransfer
orbit on Jun 18. BRISat is dedicated to banking services for the
Indonesian bank PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (Persero) Tbk.    of Jakarta.
Despite some claims to the contrary this is NOT the first satellite
launched intended to be dedicated to banking, but the second; it follows
the Russian Central Bank's Kupon satelite which operated for a few
months in 1997-1998. It's unlikely Kupon ever entered operational
service, though.

Cartosat-2
----------

India launched a Cartosat-2 series imaging satellite on Jun 22 into a
500 x 518 km orbit. The PSLV rocket then deployed a swarm of small
satellites:

         Time (UTC)      Satellite
         0412:07         Cartosat-2C, 727 kg
         0412:42         Sathyabamasat, 1.5 kg 2U cubesat for Sathyabama U. of Chennai
                                      with a greenhouse-gas IR spectrometer
         0412:43         Swayam, 1 kg 1U cubesat from COEP (College of Engineering, Pune)
                                      with technology and amateur radio payloads.
         0413:22         LAPAN-A3, a 120 kg imaging satellite for Indonesia's LAPAN space agency
                         BIROS, a 130 kg infrared satellite to study fires, for Germany's DLR,
                          which also carries the BEESAT-4 cubesat to be ejected later.
         0414:00         M3MSat/earthView-7, an 85 kg AIS satellite for Canada's Dept of National Defense
         0414:01         Skysat Gen2-1, a 110 kg imaging satellite for TerraBella's constellation
         0414:20         Claire, a 25 kg University of Toronto satellite to study greenhouse gases.
         0415:20 to 0421:30  Flock 2p-1 to 2p-12, 3U imaging cubesats for Planet (formerly PlanetLabs).

The PS4 final stage then made two burns to lower its orbit to 447 x 480 km.

MUOS 5
------

The US Navy Multiple User Object System's Space Vehicle 3 was launched on Jun 24 as MUOS 5.
The Atlas 5 rocket made three burns to 167 x 659 km x 28 deg, 191 x 32930 x 26 deg
and then 3802 x 35786 km x 19 deg, and deployed MUOS which will use its Japanese BT-4
thruster to reach GEO over the Indian Ocean as an in-orbit spare for the system,
whose 4 operational satellites are over the Atlantic, the Pacific, the Indian Ocean
and the Americas.

CZ-7
----

China inaugurated the Wenchang spaceport on Hainan Island on Jun 25 with
the launch of the first Chang Zheng 7 rocket. The CZ-7 entered orbit
with a YZ-1A upper stage, which made several burns to deploy small satellites
and then was deorbited along with a subscale spacecraft reentry cabin to
qualify systems for the next generation of Chinese human spaceflight missions.

Four small satellites are ejected from the YZ-1A: the Aoxiang Zhixing is
the first 12U cubesat, with a mass of 18 kg (33 kg including payload
adapter). Ao Long 1 is an active space debris removal experiment; Tiange
feixingqi 1 and 2, if I understand the Chinese press reports, are a pair
of satellites testing data relay to each other, perhaps similar to
NASA's recently-launched Nodes 1 and 2 (or, maybe just a pair of
communications test satellites with less ambitious goals - I can't quite
tell). Attached to the YZ-1A as a non-separable payload is the 'zai
guijia zhu shiyan zhuangzhi', the In-Orbit Refeulling Experimental
Device. The YZ-1A would be deorbited over the Pacific after the
experiment is completed; the stage has a design operation life of 48
hours. US tracking indicates the stage was deorbited on Jun 27 as expected.

The primary payload is the DFFC (Duoyongtu Feichuan Fanhui Cang,
multipurpose subscale spacecraft return capsule) flight test mission,
which is to be recovered in China. There is also a ballast frame (pei
zhong zhijia) which may be a dummy service module for the capsule. 
The capsule was deorbited on Jun 26 and landed in China at 0741 UTC.
It seems possible that the YZ-1A stage performed the deorbit and then
separated to fire again immediately, regain orbit and continue operations
for another day, but the details of what actually happened are not clear.

The objects from the launch, based on comparing the Space-Track identifications
with the orbital data and the Chinese media reports, are:

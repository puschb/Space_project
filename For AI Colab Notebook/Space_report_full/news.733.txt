International Space Station
---------------------------

Expedition 50 continues. 

The Progress MS-04 cargo ship was launched from Baykonur on a Soyuz-U
rocket on Dec 1. However, the vehicle failed during third stage burn and
its debris fell in the Tuva Republic. Lost with the rest of the cargo
was the first Orlan-MKS spacesuit (possibly serial No. 3). Unconfirmed
reports from commenters in the Novosti Kosmonavtiki forum suggest the
Progress separated from the rocket third stage prematurely and the
accelerating stage then crashed into the Progress.

The 16-tonne Japanese HTV-6 (Kounotori-6) cargo ship was launched on Dec
9. The pressurized module contains 600 kg of water and 2152 kg of dry
cargo. This includes two JAXA J-SSOD and one Nanoracks NRCSD-10 cubesat
deployers; these will be transferred to the Kibo module.

The J-SSOD #5 contains the following cubesats:
  STARS-C Oyaki and Koki ('parent' and 'child'), two 1U cubesats connected by a tether,
    from Shizuoka University which is contining the earlier STARS experiments by Kagawa U.
    STARS-C appears to have the alternate name 'Hagoromo', also used for a 1990 lunar orbiter.

The J-SSOD #6 contains the following cubesats:
  EGG, a U. Tokyo 3U cubesat with a 0.6m deployable aeroshell for controlled reentry.
  ITF-2, from Tsukuba University, a 1U amateur radio payload.
  AOBA-VeloxIII is a 2U mission from Kyushu Tech and NTU of Singapore with a 
   micropropulsion system.
  FREEDOM, a 1U cubesat with a 1.5m deorbit drag device, from Nakashima Engineering of
   Hirokawa and Tohoku University.
  Waseda-Sat3, a 1U cubesat from Waseda University with a large thin film drag sail.
  TuPOD, from GAUSS SRi (Rome), a 3U cubesat containing (and ejecting)
  two cylindrical 'Tubesats', each 0.75 kg, 0.09m dia 0.13m long. The tubesats are 
  TANCREDO-1 from a school in Ubatuba, Brazil
   and OSNSAT from the Open Space Network of Mountain View, California.

The NRCSD-10 contains four Lemur-2 3U cubesats from Spire Global, and
the TechEdSat-5 (TES-5) from NASA-Ames. TES-5 will carry out a
controlled reentry experiment with an 'exobrake' drag sail.  In
addition, the  Honeywell/Morehead U. DM-7 'dependable multiprocessor'
experiment will be attached to the Nanoracks External Platform on the
Kibo exposed facility; it is a 1U box.

The HTV also has an Exposed Pallet, which on this mission (using the
enhanced capacity EP6B+) carries a set of replacement batteries for the
ISS truss, with a total cargo mass of 1367 kg. The S4, S6, P4 and P6
truss segments each contain an Integrated Electronics Assembly (IEA),
with 12 Ni-H2 batteries apiece in separate ORUs (Orbital Replacement
Units).  On this mission the S4 batteries are to be replaced. Six new
197 kg Li-ion battery ORUs will be installed and six of the 166 kg Ni-H2
battery ORUs will be transferred to the HTV EP for disposal on reentry.
The remaining six Ni-H2 ORUs will remain on S4, but they will be taken
off line and new 29 kg Adapter Plate ORUs will  be installed between
them and the truss.

On Dec 14 the Exposed Pallet was grappled by the Canadarm-2, pulled
out of HTV-6 and attached to the Mobile Base System on the ISS truss.
On Dec 15-16 the J-SSOD #5 was moved to the Kibo module's airlock.
On Dec 19 the Japanese RMS arm took the MPEP platform, with
J-SSOD attached, out of the airlock and the STARS-C cubesat was
ejected from it at 0855 UTC. On Dec 27 J-SSOD #6 was installed
in the airlock with its sats to be deployed in January.


Gokturk-1
---------

The Turkish Defense Ministry's Gokturk-1 high resolution (0.7m) imaging satellite
was launched by the light European launch vehicle Vega on Dec 5. The satellite
was built by Thales Alenia (Cannes).

WGS 8
-----

The 8th Boeing 702-class Wideband Global Satcom payload for the US Dept.
of Defense carries an improved 'channelizer' that increases the capacity
of the satellite. The second stage was reportedly deorbited, and the
extra propellant required to do this necessitated a lower apogee
transfer orbit than for previous WGS missions. By Dec 25 WGS-8
had reached a 26728 x 44588 km x 0.2 deg orbit.

Resourcesat-2A
--------------

On Dec 7 India launched the Resourcesat-2A imaging satellite to provide
continuity of service for the system as 2011's Resourcesat-2 ages. The
satellite has a 6 metre resolution imager.

Fengyun 4-01
------------

The first satellite in the FY-4 series flew on Dec 10 to geotransfer orbit.
China's FY-1 and newer FY-3 series are polar orbiting weather satellites comparable
to the NOAA polar series, while the FY-2 constellation, now to be superseded
by the FY-4 system, consists of geostationary satellites like NOAA's GOES.
FY-4 No. 1 carries a 0.5 km resolution imager, a 913-channel IR sounder,
a lightning mapping imager, and a space environment package.

Arase
-----

Japan's second Epsilon rocket launched the 350 kg ERG geospace
science satellite on Dec 20 into elliptical orbit.
ERG carries experiments to study energetic particles, waves and fields
in the magnetosphere. After launch, ERG was renamed 'Arase' (rough water,
a metaphor for the dynamic magnetic storms of geospace).

The second Epsilon uses a new second stage, the M-35. The first flight
in 2013 used a derivative of the M-34 from the old M-V rocket. The M-35,
with a mass of 17200 kg, is a growth version sized to match the 2.6m
diameter of the larger Epsilon first stage. The third stage is the
KM-V2c, with minor improvements compared to the previous mission's
KM-V2b. The PBS liquid post-boost 4th stage was not included on this
flight.



Gaojing
-------

On Dec 28 China launched a CZ-2D from Taiyuan - the first time the 2D model has
flown from their southern launch site. However, the rocket appears to have
run into problems and achieved orbit with an underspeed of 100 m/s, making
a 212 x 520 km orbit instead of a circular 500 km one. 

The main payloads are Gaojing 1 and 2, two commercial high resolution
(0.5m) imaging satellites also called SuperView 1 and 2. The satellites
are owned by Beijing Aerospace World View Information Technology Co.,
Ltd (also called Beijing Space View Tech Co.Ltd.); the US company
DigitalGlobe is a major investor.

Also aboard was BY70-1, or Bayi kepu weixing 01 xing, a 2U cubesat with
an amateur radio payload developed by high school students at the
PLA-related Beijing Bayi School.

Tan Weixing
-----------

China's Tan Weixing (Carbon Satellite or TanSat) was launched on Dec 21.
It carries a high resolution grating spectrometer to measure CO2 and O2
distribution and a wide field of view cloud/aerosol imager. The 620 kg
satellite will map  global CO2 sources and sinks with a precision of 1
percent. Three smaller payloads from the Shanghai microsatellite center
were also carried; they are about 50 kg each. Spark-01 and Spark-02 
have hyperspectral imagers; the third, referred to as Chao fenbianlu duo
guangpu chengxiang weixing (Ultra-resolution multispectral imaging
satellite) has a 1.4m resolution imager.

Ariane
------

Ariane vehicle L587, mission VA234, placed two comm satellites in orbit
on Dec 21. JCSAT 15, for Sky Perfect JSAT of Japan, will become JCSAT-110A
once it becomes operational at 110E to replace JCSAT-110R. Star One D1,
for Embratel Star One of Brazil, will replace Brasilsat B4. Both are
Loral 1300 class satellites built in MDA/Loral's Palo Alto factory.

Tianlian 1-04
-------------

On Dec 1 Tianlian 1-04 was tracked on station at 76.9E, a few degrees from
Tianlian 1-01.

CZ-11
-----

The Nov 9 launch of a CZ-11 rocket, described last issue, put 4 objects
in a circular 500 km orbit and 3 in an elliptical 500 x 1000 km orbit.
It now appears that the final stage rocket, with attached amateur radio
payload CAS-2T, is object E, one of those in the elliptical orbit.
Space-Track has identified object A in the circular orbit as the main
pulsar navigation experiment satellite, and puts E in the 'large' radar
cross-section category which supports the idea that E is the rocket.

I am guessing that the two remaining small payloads are the two
remaining elliptical orbit objects F and G while objects B to D are
launch adapters or other debris. But it could be the other way around.

Table of Recent Suborbital Launches
-----------------------------------

There have been suggestions of planned Chinese missile launches in early
December based on NOTAM airspace closures, but no evidence that the
launches actually occurred.

On Dec 16 the US Army (as part of a NASA managed launch) test-launched the Zombie, a missile-defense target missile
probably based on an ATACMS motor. It's not clear whether the flight was exoatmospheric.
The Dec 15 MDA target launch was intercepted by two SM-6 endoatmospheric missiles from the Aegis ship DDG 53.
It's not clear what kind of target launch vehicle was used.

Also on Dec 16, according to Pentagon sources quoted by Bill Gertz in the Washington Free Beacon,
Russia again tested the Nudol antisatellite missile. It's probable Russia is still just testing
the rocket launch vehicle rather than carrying out actual intercepts at this stage.

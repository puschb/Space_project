Discovery landed on runway 15 at Kennedy Space Center
at 1855 UT on May 6. It is not clear whether or not the MPEC
classified subsatellite was deployed. Launch of STS-40/Columbia
is scheduled for early June.

Soyuz TM-12 was launched on May 18 and docked with Mir on May 20.
The crew are Anatoliy Pavlovich Artsebarskiy (Komandir), 
Sergey Konstantinovich Krikalyov (Bortinzhener) and Helen Patricia
Sharman (Kosmonavt-issledovatel'). Artsebarskiy and Krikalyov
are the new Mir main crew, replacing Afanas'ev and Manarov who
will return to Earth with Sharman in Soyuz TM-11 on around May 26.
Sharman is the first British space traveller and her participation
in the mission is part of Project Juno, which is financed by the
Moskva Narodniy Bank and has no connection with the British government.
The Progress M-7 cargo craft undocked and reentered on May 7.

The NOAA 12 weather satellite was launched into polar orbit from
Vandenberg by an Atlas E launch vehicle with a Star 37S upper stage on
May 14. The NOAA satellites are operated by the National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration, which also operates the network
of GOES satellites in geostationary orbit.

Six Soviet spacecraft, Kosmos-2143 to Kosmos-2148, were launched on May
16 into a 1400 km orbit by a three stage Tsiklon rocket. They are small
store-dump communications satellites, the military version of the Gonets
satellites recently offered for commercial use by the NPO-PM company.

10 years ago: 14-22 May 1981.  The Soyuz-40 mission carried Soviet
cosmonaut Yuriy Romanenko and Rumanian cosmonaut Dumitru Prunariu on a
visit to the Salyut-6 space station. 

20 years ago: 12-28 May 1971.  Three Soviet Mars probes were launched. 
The first, Kosmos-419, was stranded in low earth orbit by an upper stage
failure.  Mars-2 and Mars-3 entered Mars orbit in Nov-Dec 1971 and
impacted probes on the surface.  The surface probes failed to return
useful data. 

30 years ago: 24 May 1961.  The S-45A ionospheric satellite failed to
reach orbit when its Juno II booster malfunctioned.

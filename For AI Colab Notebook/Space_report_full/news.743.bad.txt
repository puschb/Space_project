International Space Station
---------------------------

Expedition 54 began at 0514 UTC Dec 14 when ferry ship Soyuz MS-05
undocked from the Rassvet module returning Ryazinskiy, Bresnik and
Nespoli to Earth, leaving Misurkin, Vande Hei, and Acaba aboard ISS.
Soyuz MS-05 landed in Kazakhstan at 0837 UTC Dec 14.

Cargo ship Cygnus OA-8E (SS Gene Cernan) was unberthed from Unity at
1752 UTC Dec 5 and released into orbit at 1311 UTC Dec 6. On Dec 6
it raised its orbit from 402 x 407 km to 447 x 456 km. It then deployed 14
cubesats on Dec 6 and 7, and lowered its orbit on Dec 8 to 384 x 396 km, below
the ISS. The ship remained in orbit for tests until it was deorbited
on Dec 18, with entry over the South Pacific at 1254 UTC.

The cubesats deployed include 8 Lemur-2 AIS/weather satellites for Spire Global,
the ISARA experiment from JPL to test using the back of a solar array
as a radio antenna, the Aerocube 7C and 7D satellites from Aerospace Corp.
to test proximity operations using cold gas thrusters as well as ground-space
laser communications, NRL's CHEFSat to space-qualify a new radio system,
and the Naval Postgraduate School's PropCube to study ionspheric propagation.
Also deployed was the 2U cubesat Asgardia-1, built by Near Space Ltd. (Indiana)
for Asgardia Space, an organization based in Vienna whose goal is to create
an independent space nation (I am skeptical of their chances).

Cargo ship Dragon CRS-13 was launched on Dec 15 at 1536 UTC. CRS-13 uses reused
capsule C108 and a new trunk (no. 15); it was launched on a Falcon 9
using reused stage 1 B1035 and new stage 2 no. 46. The second stage was
deorbited southwest of Australia at about 1630 UTC. CRS-13 arrived at
the ISS on Dec 17; it was grappled by the Canadarm-2 at 1057 UTC and
berthed on the Harmony nadir port at 1326 UTC.

The Dragon trunk carries the TSIS solar observatory and the SDS space
debris sensor. TSIS will be installed on ELC3; SDS will go on the
Columbus external payload location replacing RapidScat.

Ferry ship Soyuz MS-07 was launched on Dec 17 at 0721 UTC and docked with the
Rassvet module at 0839 UTC on Dec 29. Crew are Shkaplerov, Tingle and
Kanai. Soyuz MS-07 is vehicle no. 737, and ISS flight 53S.


Meteor-M launch failure
-----------------------

On Nov 28 Russia's Roskosmos launched a Soyuz-2-1B/Fregat from
Vostochniy, the second launch from that new spaceport (formerly
Svobodniy). The Soyuz reached its planned orbit of around 35 x 200 km
but then the Fregat upper stage fired in the wrong direction due to a
bug in its control algorithm. Its first burn should have put the stack
in an orbit of roughly 200 x 800 km, but instead reached about -470 x
202 km and drove the payload down into the atmosphere over the Atlantic
Ocean. Airliners flying near 50N 35W saw the reentry. Roskosmos
reported a likely crash site at 42N 38W.

The third stage continued on in the original orbit and plunged into the
ocean further south, near 15N 45W, off the north coast of S America.

The primary payload was the Meteor-M No. 2-1 weather satellite.
Secondary payloads lost on the launch were LEO Vantage 2
(Telesat/Canada, built by UTIAS/Toronto and SSLMDA); Baumanets-2 from
Bauman Technical University; the Astroscale IDEA-OSG-1 space debris
experiment, Corvus-BC-3 and 4 for AstroDigital, AISSAT-3 for Norway, the
SEAM and D-Star cubesas from KTH/Sweden and German Orbital Systems, and
ten Lemur-2 satellites from Spire Global.

Kosmos-2524
-----------

Russia launched a signals intelligence satellite on Dec 2 into an
elliptical orbit of 240 x 900 km. The satellite, Lotos-S1 No. 803
(codenamed Kosmos-2524), maneuvered at 0655 UTC on Dec 4 into a circular
900 x 909 km orbit.

LKW
---

China launched a high resolution imaging satellite, Ludi Kancha Weixing
1 (LKW 1, Land Survey Satellite 1), into 500 km sun-sync orbit on Dec 3.
A second such satellite, LKW 2, was launched on Dec 23 into the same
orbit but phased 180 degrees away.

Shikisai/Tsubame
-----------------

Japan launched an H-IIA rocket from Tanegashima on Dec 23 carrying two satellites
into different orbits. First, the Global Change Observation Mission - Core Satellite
(GCOM-C, named 'Shikisai') was inserted in 790 x 793 km sun-synchronous orbit.
Shikisai carries the SLGO (Second generation GLobal Land Imager) 250-metre-resolution
visible/IR camera to monitor changes in aerosols, cloud cover and vegetation.

Then the H-IIA second stage moved to a 461 x 795 km orbit and ejected a small adapter.
A further burn lowered apogee somewhat to 457 x 629 km, at which point the Super Low
Altitude Test Satellite (SLATS, named 'Tsubame') was deployed. SLATS will use its
own propulsion to lower its orbit further and test satellite control at low orbital
altitudes.

Note that Tsubame is also the name of a satellite launched by the Tokyo Institute
of Technology in Nov 2014. I deplore JAXA's habit of reusing existing satellite names 
(they did it for Hitomi as well) - it will cause unnecessary confusion for historians
for the next thousand years or so.


Iridium
--------

Ten more Iridium communications satellites were launched on a Falcon 9
from Vandenberg on Dec 23. No attempt was made to recover the first
stage (B1036, on its second flight), although it is rumoured that an
attempt to recover half of the nose fairing was made. The launch came at
local sunset, so the rocket plume was illuminated and widely observed in
the southern California area. The second stage was deorbited after
deploying the payloads.

Launch of the Falcon 9 came 72 seconds after the H2A launch. This is a
new record for the shortest time between two orbital launch attempts,
breaking the 4m44s interval between Kosmos-385 and Peole in Dec 1970.


Alcomsat
--------

China launched a DFH-4 communications satellite for Algeria on Dec 10.
By Dec 24 the satellite was stationary over 24.8W.

Beijing's China Academy of Space Technology (CAST) has now launched
5-tonne GEO comsats for a variety of countries: Nigeria, Venezuela,
Pakistan, Bolivia, Laos, Belarus and Algeria. 

GalileoSat
----------

Four European Union Galileo navigation satellites were placed in Plane A
by an Ariane 5ES on Dec 12. The Ariane 5ES uses the older EPS upper
stage, and the EPC core stage makes almost a whole orbit with
a high apogee, 42 x 3340 km x 55.4 deg! (Thanks to @DutchSpace
for passing on the data). It reentered over the east
Pacific at 2038 UTC after two hours in space. The EPS, meanwhile,
entered an elliptical orbit to coast to a 22900 km apogee where it
restarted to circularize to a 22900 x 22930 km x 57.0 deg orbit
for payload deployment.

The payloads are the FM 15 to 19 FOC satellites, GSAT0215 to 0219,
GalileoSat 19-22 (Galileo has a ridiculous number of parallel
designation systems). This is the first launch under the aegis of the
GSA (European GNSS Agency) which took over Galileo operations from ESA
in July. GSA's control centre is colocated with the German national
control center GSOC at Oberpfaffenhofen southwest of Munich.

None of the Galileo satellites have been registered with the UN, in
violation of UN Resolution 1721B and the UN Registration Convention. The
satellites were launched by France (via Arianespace) and operated until
now by ESA; both France and ESA have UN satellite registers, and the
fact that the EU does not (yet) have a register suggests to me that ESA
should be the effective `launching state' since they had effective
control of the satellites.

Simorgh
-------

In JSR 740 I noted Iran's Simorgh launch and characterized it as
probably a successful  suborbital test. I am now leaning towards it
being a failed orbital launch attempt, so I am redesignating the launch
as 2017-F04  (hence, the Meteor failure is 2017-F05). This is not
necessarily the final answer, though!

D-SAT
-----

The 3U cubesat from D-Orbit of Lomazzo, Italy carried a small solid
motor to demonstrate a commercial satellite deorbiting system. The motor
was fired at 2018 UTC on Oct 2 (I missed this at the time!). The
satellite lost attitude during the burn and the net delta-V was about 65
m/s, mostly posigrade; the orbit was raised from 496 x 508 km to 506 x
686 km instead of being lowered to negative perigee. The expected
delta-V had been 180 m/s retrograde.

Table of Recent Suborbital Launches
-----------------------------------

Another Burkan-2H missile (modified derivative of Scud, probably from an Iranian Qiam) was launched on
Dec 19 by Al Ansar forces from the Dammaj Valley area south of Sa'dah in north Yemen to Riyadh.
Saudi reports again stated that it was intercepted by PAC-2 missiles.

The third New Shepard booster made its first flight on Dec 12, carrying the second New Shepard
Crew Capsule to an apogee of 99.3 km. The booster landed back at the launch site and the capsule
was recovered by parachute. As part of preparations for human crews on the vehicle, the capsule
carried a dummy with the outstandingly punny (and timely) moniker "Mannequin Skywalker".

Jonathan's Space Report 
No. 748                                                      2018 Apr  24  Somerville, MA

International Space Station
---------------------------

Expedition 55 continues with  Anton Shkaplerov in command, Scott Tingle,
Norishige Kanai, Oleg Artemev, Ricky Arnold and Drew Feustel as flight
engineers.  Ferry ships Soyuz MS-07 and Soyuz MS-08 are docked to the
station.

Dragon CRS-14 arrived at the ISS on Apr 4. Canadarm-2 grappled it at
1040 UTC and berthed it at Harmony nadir at 1300 UTC. 

On Apr 6-8 the Canadarm-2 and Dextre robot arms removed the PFCS (Pump
Flow Control System) and MISSE-FF payloads from the Dragon trunk.
MISSE-FF was installed on Express Logistics Carrier 2; the DCSU-2 spare
unit was temporarily removed to provide easier access to the install
location and reinstalled afterwards. On Apr 11 the Canadarm-2 was used
to remove the old PFCS (PFCS 3) from the P6 truss segment; it was later
moved to Dragon's trunk for disposal. There were four PFCS on P6, all
there since P6 was launched in 2000. In May 2013 during US EVA-21
astronauts moved malfunctioning PFCS 3 from the channel 2B slot and put
it in a spare slot, replacinging it with PFCS 1, which had been part of
the old EATCS thermal control system. The new PFCS, which I label PFCS
12, went in PFCS 3's old storage slot. 

Also aboard the Dragon, as well as RemoveDebris discussed in the last
issue, was a Japanese Small Satellite Orbital Deployer (J-SSOD) carrying
three cubesats: 1KUNS-PF, a 1U cube for the University of Nairobi,
Kenya; the 3U UBAKUSAT for Istanbul Technical  University, Turkey; and
the 1U Irazu from Tecnologico de Costa Rica. They will be deployed from
the Kibo module at a later date.

TESS
----

The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), an astronomical
observatory in NASA's Explorer program, was launched on Apr 18 by Falcon
9. TESS will survey the sky to find exoplanets transiting bright stars
and nearby stars. The Falcon 9 entered an initial 250 x 250 km orbit and
then restarted to place TESS in a 280 x 272166 km x 29.6 deg  highly
elliptical orbit. The second stage then made a third burn for disposal,
and entered a hyperbolic orbit leading to a 0.83 x 1.00 AU x 0.3 deg
solar orbit.

TESS will make a lunar flyby on May 27 and reach a half-month-period
operational orbit on Jun 12. It will spend two years staring at sectors
of the sky for a month at a time until it has searched the entire sky
for transiting exoplanets. While the search is limited by the brightness
of the host stars and the large (21 arcsecond) camera pixels, and by
the probability that a planet and its star are oriented in such a way
as to cause a transit seen from Earth, TESS should discover a large
number of exoplanets that are, unlike the Kepler planets, close enough
for detailed spectroscopic followup by other observatories.


Arianespace
------------

Flight VA242 (launch vehicle L5102) successfully delivered two
communications satellites to low-inclination geotransfer orbit on Apr 5.
Hylas 4 for Avanti Communications is an Orbital ATK Geostar-3 and will
provide Ka-band broadband coverage for Europe and Africa. The DSN-1
satellite, built by Mitsubishi Electric for Sky Perfect JSAT, carries
the Kirameki-1/DSN-1 military X-band communications payload operated by
DSN Corporation on behalf of the Japanese armed forces,  and Sky Perfect
JSAT's Superbird-8 Ku-band commercial television payload.
Kirameki-1/Superbird-8 is now on station at 158E and Hylas 4 is at 21E.


Yaogan 31
---------

On Apr 10 China launched the YG-31 Group 1 mission. Satellites Yaogan
Weixing 31 hao 01 zu 01, 02 and 03 xing (which can be rendered as
YG-31-01 Sat 1, 2 and 3) were launched to an 1100 km orbit similar to
the Yaogan-9 series.

IRNSS-1I
--------

ISRO launched the Indian Regional Navigation Satellite Systems's IRNSS-1I satellite to transfer
orbit on Apr 11. The successful launch follows the failure of IRNSS-1H after a fairing separation
failure during launch last year; it was left in a 6500 km apogee orbit which has now decayed
to 4500 km. IRNSS-1H is in an inclined geosynchronous orbit.

Kosmos-2526
-----------

The Russian Defense Ministry's second Blagovest communications satellite, Blagovest No. 12L,
was launched on Apr 19. It will be given the cover name Kosmos-2526. According to Russian
sources, the satellite reached geosynchronous orbit successfully.
As of Apr 24, only the discarded propellant tank in transfer orbit had public US orbit data.


X-37B
-----

The USAF OTV-5 spaceplane mission launched in Sep 2017 has finally been located in orbit by hobbyists.
On Apr 11 orbit was 355 x 356 km x 54.5 deg - a higher orbit inclination than earlier X-37B missions.
Around 0500 UTC Apr 19 it lowered its orbit to 310 x 323 km x 54.5 deg.


Orbituary
---------

Japan's Jikiken (EXOS-B) magnetospheric research satellite, which operated in elliptical orbit
from 1978 to 1985, reentered on Apr 22. The small satellite, with a mass of 92 kg, deployed
long wire antennae to measure the electric field in the magnetosphere. The antennae were
designed to span 206 metres, although in the end they were only deployed to 103m span.


Erratum:
--------

MISSE-FF is owned by Alpha Space of Houston, not Astra LLC.

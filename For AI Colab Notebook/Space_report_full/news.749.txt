International Space Station
---------------------------

Expedition 55 continues with  Anton Shkaplerov in command, Scott Tingle,
Norishige Kanai, Oleg Artemev, Ricky Arnold and Drew Feustel as flight
engineers.  Ferry ships Soyuz MS-07 and Soyuz MS-08 are docked to the
station.

On May 5 Dragon CRS-14 returned to Earth. The Canadarm-2 released it at 1323 UTC;
the deorbit burn as at 1806 UTC and it splashed down at 30 N 123W around 1900 UTC.

On May 11, three cubesats were ejected from the J-SSOD-8 deployer carried
up on CRS-14; they were described in the last issue. The Costa Rican cubesat
Irazu has been renamed Batsu-CS1.

On May 16 astronauts Feustel and Arnold conducted spacewalk US EVA-50
in spacesuits 3006 and 3003. The Quest airlock was depressurized at 1133 UTC
and repressurized at 1810 UTC. During the spacewalk the astronauts worked with
the Pump Flow Control System (PFCS) units for the ammonia cooling system.
As of Apr 11 there were 12 PFCS units on ISS: the serial numbers here are my own
invention, but I have confirmed that my PFCS 4 is indeed S/N 0004. I tabulate
their histories below - I think this is right but I welcome corrections.
Each of the solar-panel-bearing segments P4, P6, S4, S6 has two PFCS;
in addition P6 has two extra PFCS slots for the Early Active Thermal
Control System which operated from 2000 to 2007. One spare unit is
stored on External Stowage Platform 1 (ESP1).

PFCS 2 'Trippy' was moved to the  Dragon CRS-14 trunk on Apr 14, and it
was destroyed on the trunk's reentry on May 5. CRS-14 had delivered PFCS
12 'Motley' to replace it. PFCS 4 'Leaky' was then robotically extracted
from the P6 and placed on Dextre's temporary holding location, the EOTP.
During the spacewalk the astronauts moved PFCS4 to ESP-1, exchanging it
with PFCS 5 'Frosty' which ended up on the EOTP. PFCS 5 was moved the
next day to a spare slot in the P6 truss where its functionality could
be partially tested.

In addition to the PFCS work, the EVA-50 crewmembers replaced a camera group
on location CP13 and an SGTRC relay box on the Z1 truss.

The Orbital ATK Cygnus OA-9 mission, SS J.R. Thompson, was launched on May 21
by Antares from Wallops/MARS. It arrived at ISS on May 24, with Canadarm-2
capture at 0926 UTC and berthing on Unity at 1213 UTC.

TESS
----

The TESS exoplanet hunter reached its first perigee at 0542 UTC Apr 25
and made a successful burn to raise apogee to lunar distance. Apogee 2
was at 1903 UTC Apr 29, at 353440 km. TESS made an 8119 km lunar flyby
at 0632 UTC May 17, leaving it in a 100000 x 449000 km x 36.4 deg orbit
around Earth. Meanwhile, the TESS cameras were tested successfully;
regular observations should begin in June.

Queqiao 
--------

China's Queqiao deep-space communications relay satellite was launched
on May 20. It will unfurl a 4.2m dish antenna. After a 100 km lunar
flyby on about May 25 it will take up station in a 13000-km-wide 'halo
orbit' around the Earth-Moon L2 point,  64445 km behind the Moon, to
provide farside radio communications to support the planned Chang'e 4
farside lander.

Earth-Moon L1 and L2 (EML1, EML2) are on the lunar Hill sphere that
marks the approximate point where lunar gravity dominates over Earth
gravity. Don't confuse them with Sun-Earth L1 and L2 (SEL1, SEL2) on the
1.5-million-km radius Earth-Moon system Hill sphere which marks the
point  at which the Earth's gravity (with the Moon's help) dominates
over the Sun. (I'm using 'dominate' here in a very loose way, to mean
`this is the point at which it's a better approximation to  pretend
you're in orbit around object A rather than object B'). SEL1 and SEL2
have been used a lot since ISEE-3 went to SEL1 in 1978. EML1 and EML2
are much less well known. They were explored by Japan's Hiten probe in
1990; the ARTEMIS P1/P2 spacecraft and the Chang'e-5FTD vehicle also
visited them, but this will be the first time a probe has used either
EML location as its primary mission destination.

Queqiao made a 100 km lunar flyby at 1340 UTC May 25 and made  a braking
burn close to perilune to put it on course to reach EML2. The CZ-4C
third stage made a 9900 km lunar flyby at 1403 UTC May 25, and ended up
in a 16910 x 444000 km x 14.5 deg Earth orbit.

The CZ-4C also deployed two 45 kg DSLWP (Discovering the Sky at Longest
Wavelengths Pathfinder) small astronomy satellites, Longjiang-1 and 2
(DSLWP-A and B). The two satellites also made lunar encounters on May
25. Longjiang-2 is confirmed to have successfully entered
lunar orbit; initial orbit parameters were around 350 x 13800 km x 21 deg. 
Contact was lost with Longjiang-1 on May 21; if it failed to make the
insertion burn it will probably end up in an orbit similar to the third stage.


Mars Insight
------------

The NASA/JPL Mars Insight probe was launched from Space Launch Complex
3-East at Vandenberg Air Force Base on May 5. Centaur AV-078 entered a
185 x 185 km x 64.0 deg parking orbit. After almost one orbit it made a
second burn to a hyperbolic orbit of 115 x -110126 km x  63.54 deg which
will lead to a 1.0 x 1.4 AU x 2.3 deg orbit around the Sun and arrival
in Mars' gravitational sphre on Nov 22. Insight will land on Mars on Nov
26.

Two 6U cubesats were deployed from the Centaur Aft Bulkhead Carrier.
Mars Cube One (MarCO) A and B have freon-based propulsion systems and
will fly independently to Mars on a closely similar trajectory, making a
flyby to test their ability to relay data from the lander during
descent.


Sentinel-3B
-----------

ESA's Sentinel 3B Earth observing satellite was launched from Plesetsk on Apr 25
aboard Eurockot's Rokot/Briz-KM vehicle. Sentinel-3B is in the same orbit plane
as Sentinel-3A, launched in 2016, and following 10 minutes behind it.

CZ-11
----

China launched the fourth CZ-11 rocket on Apr 26, carrying Zhuhai Orbita's Zhuhai-1 Group 2
satellites. These include the 90 kg OVS-2 video satellite and the OHS-01/02/03/04 hyperspectral
camera satellites.

CBAS/EAGLE
----------

On Apr 14 ULA launched Atlas AV-079 with a US military payload. The
Centaur stage made three burns to deliver the CBAS and EAGLE satellites to orbit.

The ULA press kit implied a 38992 x 38992 km x 0 deg orbit thousands of km above the
geosynchronous belt, but this appears to have been a typo or misinformation, since
hobbyists soon located the payloads in a near-synchronous 35233 x 35275 km x 0.1 deg
orbit. By May 11, CBAS was braking to geostationary at 112W.

The CBAS (Continuous Broadcast Augmenting SATCOM) satellite is operated
by USAF SMC's Military Satellite Communications Directorate. Its
manufacturer is unknown, and its role is obscure.

EAGLE is a satellite built from the ESPA mutiple satellite adapter 
first flown in 2007. ESPA is a ring that sits between CBAS and the
Centaur, with attachment points for small satellites and experiments
spaced around it. (The LCROSS Shepherding Spacecraft in 2009 was
similarly built from an ESPA ring attached to its Centaur). EAGLE stands
for ESPA Augmented Geostationary Laboratory Experiment; ESPA stands for
EELV Secondary Payload Adapter; and EELV stands for Evolved Expendable
Launch Vehicle. The EAGLE bus is known as ESPAStar and the satellite was
built by Orbital ATK. EAGLE is operated by the Air Force Research Lab.

It appears the EAGLE ESPA-ring-based satellite launched on Apr 14
deployed two secret 100-kg-class  box shaped payloads on about Apr 26
and a third possibly on May 11. These use the ESPASat bus, designed to
fit in the ESPAStar azimuthal slots. One of these is Mycroft, an
experiment which will carry out formation flying between 1 and 35 km
from EAGLE to test space surveillance and proximity operations
technology. The second and third payloads are a mystery at the moment.

There is also one debris object released at the time of launch, possibly
some kind of payload adapter between EAGLE and CBAS.

Apstar 6C
---------

Asia Pacific Telecom's Apstar 6C (Yatai 6C) communications satellite
was launched on May 3 to geotransfer orbit. Apstar 6C is a CAST/Beijing DFH-4
with 26 C-band and 19 Ku/Ka-band transponders. By May 14 it was on station
at 136.5E.

Gao Fen 5
----------

China's Gao Fen 5 high resolution imaging satellite was launched on May
8. Instruments on board are the Advanced Hyperspectral Imager, Visual
and IR Multispectral Sensor, Greenhouse Gas Monitoring Instrument,
Atmospheric Infrared Ultraspectral sensor, Environment Monitoring
Instrument, and the Directional Polarization Camera.

Bangabandhu
------------

The first major Bangladeshi-owned satellite, Bangabandhu 1, was launched
on May 11 by the first Block 5 Falcon 9. It reached geostationary
orbit at 119E on May 23. The satellite is a Spacebus 4000, from
Thales Alenia's Cannes satellite factory.

The Falcon 9 Block 5 has improvements for reusability and reliability,
but is generally similar to the earlier Falcon 9.


Kosmos-2521
-----------

As noted by Phillip Clark on nasaspaceflight.com, the Kosmos-2521 inspector
satellite made a major orbit change on Apr 30, lowering its orbit from
644 x 660 km to only 350 x 369 km. Since then it has been undergoing
natural orbit decay.

Iridium/GRACE-FO
----------------

SpaceX carried out the 6th Iridium-Next launch from Vandenberg on May
22. 5 more Iridium satellites were deployed, this time to elliptical 500
x 700 km parking orbits. First, the Falcon 9 second stage dropped off
two scientific payloads in a 500 km circular orbit. 

The GRACE-FO (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment, Follow-on)
satellites replace GRACE 1 and 2 which were launched in 2002 and
reentered a few months ago, and will detect subtle changes in the local
gravitational field due to shifts in the oceans. The GRACE mission is
led by JPL and Germany's Geoforschungszentrum Potzdam (GFZ).

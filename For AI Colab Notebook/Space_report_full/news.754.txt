International Space Station
---------------------------

During September Expedition 56 continued with astronauts Feustel,
Artem'ev, Arnold, Prokop'ev, Aunon-Chancellor and Gerst.

Japan's HTV-7 (Kounotori 7) cargo ship was launched on Sep 22. It
arrived at ISS on Sep 27; the Canadarm-2 grappled it at 1134 UTC and
berthed it at Harmony nadir at 1409 UTC. On Sep 28 the SSRMS moved the
Exposed Pallet (EP) from HTV-7 to the truss MBS POA location. The EP
carries a set of replacement batteries for the P4 truss; spacewalkers
will install them. Meanwhile, the J-SSOD-10 deployer was transferred
from HTV-7 to the Kibo module in preparation for deployment of three
cubesats. Express Rack 9B was installed in the Columbus module, Express
Rack 10B in Kibo, and the Life Support Rack in Destiny.

On Oct 4 at 0757 UTC, astronauts Artem'ev, Feustel and Arnold undocked from the Poisk
module in Soyuz MS-08. The spacecraft made its deorbit burn at 1051 UTC
and landed in Kazakhstan at 1145 UTC. With the undocking, Expedition 57 began under
the command of Alex Gerst.

On Oct 6, the JEM RMS extracted the J-SSOD-10 deployer from the Kibo airlock.
At 0800 UTC the deployer ejected three cubesats: RSP-00 for RymanSpace,
SPATIUM-I for Nanyang Tech U (Singapore), and STARS-Me for Shizuoka University.
STARS-Me will separate into two 1U pieces joined by a 14-metre tether, plus a small
`climber' robot that will move up and down the tether.


Beidou
------

Two more Beidou-3 navigation satellites were launched on Sep 19. 
Beidou 37 and 38, also known as Beidou-3 vehicles M13 and M14, were
placed in 22000 km circular orbits.

Ariane VA243
------------

On Sep 25 Arianespace successfully launched the 100th Ariane 5, placing
two communications satellites in geotransfer orbit.
The upper payload was Horizons 3e, for the Horizons joint venture
between Intelsat and Japan's Sky Perfect JSAT. The satellite uses
a Boeing 702MP bus with a launch mass of 6441 kg.
The lower payload was Azerspace-2/Intelsat-38, a Maxar SSL-1300 
with a launch mass of 3500 kg. 

Centispace-1-1S
---------------

China's EXPACE, a commercial launch provider which is part of the
government CASIC missile company, launched the second Kuaizhou-1A
vehicle on Sep 29 carrying a small commercial communications/navigation
technology payload to orbit. Before launch the satellite was known as
Centispace-1-1S in English and as Weili kongjian yi hao xitong S1 shiyan
weixing (Micro-space 1 System S1 Test Satellite) in Chinese; after
launch it was renamed Xiangrikui 1 (`Sunflower One'). It is a 97 kg
payload built by the Shanghai microsatellite innovation center IMI-CAS
for Beijing Weilai Daohang Keji YG (Beijing Future Navigation Tech Co
Ltd). I am assuming Centispace is the English marketing name of the
company. The satellite was placed in a 1030 local time sun-sync orbit
and carries a GNSS receiver for orbit determination and a laser
intersatellite comms link.

The satellite separated from stage 4 in a 697 x 710 km orbit at about
0430 UTC; stage 4  made a 266 m/s depletion burn at 0453 UTC to a 265 x
820 km orbit.


SAOCOM-1A
---------

Argentina's CONAE space agency has its first radar imaging satellite in
orbit, SAOCOM-1A (Satelite Argentino de Observacion Con Microondas). The
3000 kg satellite has a 10 x 2.5m L-band synthetic aperture radar
antenna to study soil moisture, and was built by the Argentine company
INVAP SE.

SAOCOM-1A was launched on Oct 8 by a SpaceX Falcon 9 from Vandenberg's
Space Launch Complex 4-East (SLC-4E). The Falcon 9 first stage, B1048,
became the first to return for a Vandenberg landing, at Landing Zone 4
(LZ-4) on the old SLC-4W. The second stage ignited again for the deorbit
burn at about 0342 UTC over Poland,  and reentered SE of Hawaii at about
0413 UTC.


Hayabusa-2
----------

JAXA felt it understood The problem with the lidar readings that
interrupted TD1-R1, so the descent to release the MINERVA II1 rovers
went ahead on schedule. Hayabusa-2 began its descent from the 20 km home
point at 0508 UTC Sep 20. By 0406 UTC Sep 21 it was only 50 metres above
Ryugu descending  at 0.1m/s. The MINERVA II1  cover was ejected at 0406
UTC followed by Rover 1A and Rover 1B. All three objects then sailed
down the asteroid surface, while at about 0411 UTC Hayabusa-2 made a
divert burn to reverse its descent and return to the home position.

Both Rover 1A and Rover 1B successfully reached the surface, possibly
around 0425 UTC. They then began hopping around the asteroid while
taking pictures. The rovers are 1 kg discs, about 0.12m high 0.15m dia.
They contain an internal mechanism which can be made to spin; changes
in its angular momentum cause the rover to flip over and `hop' to
another position on the surface. Regular wheeled rovers would not
be practical in the low gravity, irregular-surfaced enviroment
of Ryugu, where the escape velocity is only about 1 km/hr.

On Oct 2-3 Hayabusa-2 again descended close to Ryugu; at 0157 UTC Oct 3
it ejected the German-French MASCOT lander at an altitude of 51 metres,
and then retreated to 3 km altitude. MASCOT landed on Ryugu at about
0217 UTC and transmitted from the surface until 1904 UTC. Hayabusa-2
then returned to  its 20 km home position again.


RemoveDebris
------------

I've entered the RemDeb Net in the launch list on the assumption (estimation)
that it was ejected about one minute after DebrisSat-1.
The RemoveDebris project is led by Surrey Space Centre and operated by SSTL.

SJ-17
-----

David Todd of Seradata has pointed out that China's SJ-17 satellite made an unusual
manuever in GEO, increasing its inclination from 0 to 4 degrees in January and then
reversing the change in July. The satellite has moved back and forth through the
geostationary belt between East Africa and the mid-Pacific in a series of
rapid relocations, followed by a period of brief stays at a series of Indian Ocean
locations. Its history to date is detailed below.

Parker Solar Probe
------------------

The Parker Solar Probe entered Venus' gravitational sphere at 2035 UTC
Oct 2.  Parker flew 2428 km above the surface of Venus at  0846 UTC Oct
3 and departed the Venus gravitational sphere at 2056 UTC.  Before
encounter, Parker was in a 0.208 x 1.014 AU x 5.6 deg solar orbit  (31 x
152 million km). Now, it is in a 0.166 x 0.938 AU x 3.4 deg (25 x
140 million km). First perihelion will be on Nov 6 at 0329 UTC.

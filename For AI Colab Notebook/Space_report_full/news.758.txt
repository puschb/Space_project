International Space Station
---------------------------

Expedition 57 continues aboard the ISS.

Ferry ship Soyuz MS-11 was launched at 1131 UTC Dec 3 and docked with the Poisk
module at 1733 UTC the same day. The MS-11 crew of Kononenko
(Roskosmos), Saint-Jacques (CSA) and McClain (NASA) joined astronauts
Gerst (ESA),  Prokop'ev (Roskosmos), and Aunon-Chancellor (NASA) on the ISS.

Cargo ship Dragon CRS-16 was launched on Dec 5 from Cape Canaveral's Launch Complex
40. The Falcon 9 first stage developed a hydraulic problem during descent
and began rolling just before the landing burn. It recovered control
just before touchdown and landed gently on the water a short distance
off the Cape Canaveral beach. The stage was towed back to port.
Meanwhile, the second stage reached orbit successfully and deployed
the Dragon. Stage 2 was deorbited south of Australia at about 1915 UTC.

CRS-16 carries two trunk payloads. GEDI is an instrument to measure
forest biomass and will be installed on the Kibo Exposed Facility at EFU
6. RRM-3 (Robotic Refuelling Mission) is a package to test three robotic
tools and the long term storage and transfer of cryogenic methane. It
will be installed on the Express Logistics Carrier ELC-1 Site 3.

CRS-16's pressurized cabin contains 1598 kg of cargo including the
NRCSD-16 cubesat package and several cubesats. Cubesats thought to be
aboard include UNITE (U of Southern Indiana), Delphini 1 (Aarhus
University), CATSat (APL/DoD), and the 1x6U TechEdSat-8  (San Jose State
and NASA-Ames).  TechEdSat-8 (TES-8) is an exciting mission which will
deploy a drag brake, perform a controlled  gradual reentry and - if all
goes well - be recovered. Also in the cabin is Slingshot, a small
satellite deployer that will be installed in the hatch of the NG-10
Cygnus cargo ship, and the EHDC external HD camera assembly which will
be installed on ISS during a spacewalk.

CRS-16 arrived at the ISS on Dec 8; it was grappled by the Canadarm-2
at 1221 UTC and berthed at Harmony nadir at 1536 UTC.

It's a pretty full house in the ISS parking lot now with two ferry ships
(Soyuz MS-09 at Rassvet, Soyuz MS-11 at Poisk) and four cargo ships:
Progress MS-09 at Pirs, Progress MS-10 at Zvezda aft, Cygnus NG-10 at
Unity nadir, and Dragon CRS-16 (or SpX-16) at Harmony nadir.

Insight
-------

Insight landed on Elysium Planitia, Mars, at about 4.5N 135.9E, at 1944:52 UTC Nov 26.
The MarCO cubesats relayed real-time data from the descent to Earth.
Shortly before entry the approaching probes passed close to the Martian moon Phobos.

Hayabusa-2
----------

Contrary to my report in the last issue, Hayabusa-2 left its 20 km
home position on Nov 23 and is backing off to 100 km from Ryugu, to make
sure it doesn't collide with the asteroid during `conjunction' when
communications with Earth are impaired because the Sun is in the way.
On Nov 30 at a range of 75 km the probe made a burn of 3.8 mm/s to slightly
accelerate the retreat. On Dec 11 it will reach an aporyugon (yes, I just
made that word up) of 110 km. Another orbit manuever will be made on Dec 25
as Ryugu emerges from behind the Sun as seen from Earth.

OSIRIS-REx
-----------

The OSIRIS-REx space probe has arrived at (101955) Bennu. It entered the asteroid's 35-km
Hill sphere at around 0h UTC on Dec 1 and made a stationkeeping burn at range 20 km
at 1700 UTC Dec 3.


PSLV
----

On Nov 29 India's ISRO launched PSLV flight C43 and placed a cluster of small
satellites in orbit. The main payload was ISRO's HySIS hyperspectral imaging
satellite, a 380 kg IMS-2 class craft. BlackSky's 55 kg Global-1 imaging sat was the other
non-cubesat payload. 
Also deployed were a series of cubesats:
   Technology satellites - FACSAT (built by GOMSPACE for the Colombia Air Force Academy EMAVI)
                         - InnoSAT-2 (ATSB, Malaysia)
                         - HSAT-1 (Harris Corp, Palm Bay, Florida)
                         - 3Cat-1 (1U) (U. Poly. Catalunya, Barcelona)
   Imaging satellies - Flock 3r, a set of 12 model 10 and 4 model 21 Dove satellites for Planet
   Hyperspectral imagers - Reaktor Hello World (2U), for Reaktor Space Lab Ltd (Helsinki)
   AIS/ADS-B/GPS-RO weather - four Lemur-2 for Spire
   GPS-RO weather - CICERO-8 (6U), built by Tyvak for GeoOptics (Pasadena)
   IoT data relay satellites - Centauri 1 for Fleet Space (Adelaide)
                             - Hiber 1 (6U) for Hiber (Delft, Netherlands)
                             - CASE for Kepler Communications (Toronto)



Rokot
-----

On Nov 30 Russia launched a Rokot vehicle into a 1485 x 1508 km orbit.
Three Rodnik military low orbit comm satellites,
given codenames Kosmos-2530 to 2532, were deployed at about 0410 UTC.
The Briz-KM upper stage lowered its orbit at 0424 UTC to 1176 x 1506 km.
A fifth object cataloged in this lower orbit is probably just a debris
object. It could be a small extra payload, but has not maneuvered to date.

SSO-A
-----

A SpaceX Falcon 9 was launched from Vandenberg on Dec 3 with Spaceflight Inc's
SSO-A small satellite deployment mission.

After launch at 1834 UTC, the first stage landed on the droneship Just Read The 
Instructions at 1842 UTC and the second stage entered orbit at 1844 UTC.
At 1847 UTC the UFF (Upper Free Flyer) spacecraft separated from the MPC
(Multi Payload Container) attached to stage 2. At some point after this
the MPC deployed 4 medium-sized payloads and the UFF deployed
a large number of payloads. Then the LFF (Lower Free Flyer) separated
from the UFF (I think; or possibly from the MPC) and deployed a cluster of
cubesats. Deployments continued over several hours. Stage 2, with the MPC
still attached, was deorbited at about 1945 UTC. Finally, UFF deployed a drag
sail. Regrettably, Spaceflight Inc have not released details of the deployment
timings or explained which payloads were deployed from which vehicle.

Larger payloads on SSO-A include:
  Technology satellites:  STPSat-5 built by Sierra Nevada for the USAF Space Test Program (110 kg?)
                          eXCITe-PTB1 built by NovaWurks for DARPA (155 kg?)

Ariane
------

Ariane flight VA246, possibly vehicle L5104, was laucnhed on Dec 4
carrying Korea's GEO-Kompsat-2A weather satellite and ISRO's GSAT-11
large communications satellite.

Saudisat
--------

Two 425 kg Saudi technology satellites, Saudisat-5A and 5B, were the
primary payloads on a CZ-2D launched from Jiuquan to sun-synch
orbit on Dec  7. 10 small satellites were also deployed. There
is some confusion about which satellites were involved, but
it appears three are from Spacety/Tianyi Research (Changsha),
one is from MinoSpace/Weina Xingkong Keji ( Beijing) and
several are 'Piao chong' ('Ladybird') cubesats for IoT data relay
from CommSat/Jiutian Weixing Keji Fazhan YG (Beijing).

Chang'e-4
----------

The long-awaited Chang'e-4 lunar farside landing mission was launched on
Dec 7 from Xichang into a 200 x 420000 km x 29.4 deg orbit.  The vehicle
is similar in design to Chang'e-3 and carries a 140 kg lunar rover
similar to that mission's Yutu. It is scheduled to enter lunar orbit on
Dec 11 at about 1500 UTC and land in the farside South Pole-Aitken
region on about Jan 4. The Queqiao satellite, in an Earth-Moon-L2 halo
orbit, will relay communications from the lander and rover to Earth.

The CZ-3B Y30 third stage, in a similar initial orbit of about 200 x
390000 km, will fly past the lunar surface at a height of 4840 km around
1138 UTC Dec 12 and end up in a 181000 x 735800 km x 23.6 deg orbit,
according to calculations by Bill Gray based on observations at
Haleakala.

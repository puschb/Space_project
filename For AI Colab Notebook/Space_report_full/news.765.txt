International Space Station
---------------------------

On May 1-2 the Canadarm-2 and Dextre arms were used to replace a failed Main Bus Switching
Unit on the ISS S0 truss. The failed MBSU supported the channel 3 solar arrays.
It was exchanged with an MBSU on External Stowage Platform 2. This replacement unit was originally
the channel 2 MBSU, which failed in 2017, was brought inside ISS, repaired, and replaced on ESP-2.
There are 7 MBSUs on ISS:

   Launch order   Launch year   Current role
   MBSU 1         2002          Failed, on ELC-2 since 2013
   MBSU 2         2002          Active as MBSU-3 since 2019
   MBSU 3         2002          Failed, on ESP-2 since 2019
   MBSU 4         2002          Active as MBSU-4 since 2002
   MBSU 5         2005          Active as MBSU-2 since 2017
   MBSU 6         2007          Active as MBSU-1 since 2012
   MBSU 7         2013          Spare on ESP-2 since 2013


On May 4 SpaceX launched Dragon CRS-17 towards the Station. The CRS-17 trunk carries
OCO-3, a carbon measuring experiment, and STP-H6, with a set of USAF Space Test Program
experiments. STP-H6's experiments include XCOM, an X-ray transmitter which will carry
out communications experiments using the ISS NICER X-ray observatory as a receiver -
giving a whole different meaning to "X-band". 

Dragon arrived at ISS on May 6, with SSRMS grapple at 1101 UTC and
berthing on Harmony nadir at 1422 UTC.  On May 10-11 OCO-3 was installed
on site EFU3 of the Kibo Exposed Facility, and STP-H6 was installed on
site 3 of Express Logistics Carrier ELC-3. The CATS experiment, launched
in 2015, was removed from the Kibo EF and installed in Dragon's trunk
for disposal; the SCAN testbed, launched in 2012, was similarly removed
from the ELC-3 and stowed in the trunk.

A failed BCDU (battery charge-discharge unit), launched in 2006, was removed from 
the P4 truss on Apr 3 and placed on ELC-1; on May 16 it was brought inside the Kibo
airlock.

On May 29 astronauts Ovchinin and Kononenko made a spacewalk, VKD-46, from the
Pirs module, using spacesuits Orlan MKS-4 and MKS-5. For this spacewalk, to celebrate
the 85th birthday of the first spacewalker on May 30, they wore backpacks decorated
with the slogans "Leonov Number 1" and "Happy Birthday Aleksey Arkhipovich" (in Russian,
of course).

They depressurized the airlock at about 1530 UTC and opened the hatch at 1542 UTC.
They installed a commemorative portrait of Leonov on the EVA ladder, retrieved
a decontamination towel left tied to a handrail by Yuriy Lonchakov in Dec 2008;
retrieved a thermal sensor boom, 'Test' exposure cassettes, the IMPAKT experiment
and Vinoslivost' panels, cleaned windows on the airlock module,
and disassembled the Obstanovka experiment. Two Obstanovka experiment boxes
and two mounting booms were jettisoned between 1945 and 2101 UTC.
The hatch was closed at 2143 UTC and the airlock was repressurized at 2148 UTC.

Electron
--------

On May 5 Rocket Lab launched Electron mission 6, nicknamed 'That's A Funny Looking Cactus'.
The payload was USAF Space Test Program mission STP-27RD, consisting of the 150 kg
Harbinger satellite and two cubesats.

Harbinger is a small imaging radar satellite built by York Space Systems (Denver)
and will carry out a mission for the US Army Space and Missile Defense Command.

SPARC-1 (Space Plug-and-Play Architecture Cubesat)  is a 6U mission from
the USAF Research Lab and the Swedish defense agency FMV, testing
advanced computing hardware in space.

The Falcon Orbital Debris Experiment (Falcon-ODE) 1U cubesat from the USAF Academy, will release
2cm and 4cm steel spheres to act as tracking targets.


Beidou DW45
-----------

The 45th Beidou satellite was  Beidou-2 G8, a replenishment satellite for the older Beidou phase 2
system. It was launched to geotransfer orbit on May 17.

RISAT-2B
--------

India's RISAT-2B radar imaging satellite was launched on May 22. It replaces the Israeli-built 
RISAT-2, launched in 2009. Mass of RISAT-2B is 615 kg.

Yaogan-33
---------

The launch of China's Yaogan-33 radar satellite on May 23 was a failure.
The third stage burn was not performed successfully and the vehicle did
not reach orbit.


Starlink
--------

SpaceX launched its first batch of 60 Starlink Ku-band internet
satellites on May 24.  The Falcon 9 rocket placed the satellites in a
434 x 442 km x 53.0 deg. Each one is about 200-250 kg (the press kit
says 227 kg, but this is suspiciously close to the metric equivalent of
500 pounds, so it's possible they really mean 500+-50 lb = 227 +- 23
kg). The satellites are a flat panel with krypton-propellant electric
thrusters and a single deployable solar panel.

Observers in Europe saw the satellites as a spectacular string of mag 2
to 3 objects a few hours after launch. As of May 30 it appears the
satellites are mostly in the mag 4 to 7 range with frequent flares to
mag 2 and occasional brighter flares, depending on illumination
conditions and satellite orientation. (For the nonastronomers:
bigger mag is fainter, mag 1 = brightest stars in the sky and
mag 6 = barely naked-eye visible at a dark site).

The brightness of the satellites has raised concerns in the astronomical
community - a full constellation of many thousand satellites could
interfere with observations and, if they are brighter than mag 5 or so,
might dominate the naked-eye night sky in dark locations. However, it is
likely to take some weeks before we really understand how much of the
time the satellites are bright and whether it's a real problem. SpaceX
have now stated that they will look at ways to reduce the reflectivity
of later satellites.

In the meantime, the  60 satellites launched so far are fascinating to
watch, if you live somewhere less cloudy than Boston has been lately.

SpaceX report that 56 of the 60 satellites are working as expected,
and 4 have some problems but are in communication with the ground.
In addtion, there are a further 4 debris objects which tumble with
large observed brightness variations


Glonass
-------

Glonass-M No. 58 (Uragan-M No. 758) was launched on May 27, replenishing
the Russian navigation system. It will probably get the official cover name Kosmos-2534. 

Yamal-601
---------

Yamal-601, a communications satellite for the Russian company Gazprom Space Systems built
by ISS Reshetnev, was launched on May 30 by a Proton from Baykonur into geotransfer
orbit. 


Hayabusa-2
----------

Hayabusa-2 ejected a second small `target marker' onto the surface of Ryugu
at about 0219 UTC May 30, during another descent to about 10 metres above
the asteroid.

WGS 10
------

The USAF Wideband Global Satcom 10 satellite, launched on Mar 16 to a mildly
supersynchronous 462 x 44260 km x 27.0 deg transfer orbit, is using an unusual ascent
path to GEO. By Mar 26 its orbit was near-synchronous and equatorial but elliptical, 
25876 x 45130 km x 0.2 deg. Since then it has slowly circularized and by May 30
its orbit was 34716 x 36850 km. This is in contrast to the usual practice of getting
one end of the ellipse to the GEO height quickly and only then adjusting the other.
The WGS 10 strategy may allow comms with a single ground station more quickly.

SSO-A
-----

Three more SSO-A cubesats have been identified: objects J, U and W are SPAWAR-CAL-O,
SPAWAR-CAL-R, and SPAWAR-CAL-OR. They are 1U cubesats for the US Navy Space and 
Naval Warfare Systems Command (SPAWAR) used for calibration of space tracking systems
and carry optical and radar reflectors.


Erratum
-------

IOD-1 GEMS is owned by Satellite Applications Catapult Ltd., although
built by Orbital Microsystems and ClydeSpace. Catapult has a ground
station at Goonhilly in Cornwall, site of the first transatlantic satcom
link.

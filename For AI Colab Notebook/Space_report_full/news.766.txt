International Space Station
---------------------------

Cargo ship Dragon CRS-17 returned to Earth on Jun 3. The 9-tonne CRS-17
was unberthed from the Harmony module at 1235 UTC, released by
Canadarm-2 at 1601 UTC, and fired its engines to deorbit at about 2056
UTC. The trunk, containing the old CATS and SCAN experiments, was
jettisoned and destroyed on reentry about 2120 UTC. Capsule C113 landed
in the Pacific at about 121W 32N at roughly 2150 UTC.

Cargo ship Progress MS-10 undocked from the Zvezda module at 0840 UTC
Jun 4. After a deorbit burn at 1146 UTC, it reentered the atmosphere and
fragments fell in the  Pacific east of New Zealand at 1229 UTC.

Cygnus CRS-11 remains berthed at Unity nadir, and Progress MS-11 is docked
to Pirs.

On Jun 13-15 the Dextre arm was used to relocate several spares on the external pallets:
    LDU spare     ESP-3 Site 4 to ESP-3 Site 3
    CMG spare     ELC-2 Site 5 to ESP-3 Site 4
    BCDU spare    ESP-3 Site 6 to ELC-1 Site 4
    BCDU FSE      ELC-1 Site 4 to ESP-3 Site 6

On Jun 17 four cubesats were deployed from the J-SSOD-11 dispensers on
the end of the Kibo module's JRMS robot arm. The three 1U BIRDS-3
satellites were Uguisu, for Kyushu Inst. of Technology; NepaliSat-1 for
Nepal Academy of Science and Technology (Kathmandu); and Raavana-1 for
the Arthur C. Clarke Institute of Modern Technologies (Colombo/Moratuwa,
Sri Lanka).  The fourth cubesat, of 3U size, is SpooQy-1, for the
National University of Singapore, with an experiment to transmit
entangled photon pairs to an optical ground station.

At 2352 UTC on Jun 24 astronauts Konononeko, McClain and Saint-Jacques undocked from the Poisk
module in Soyuz MS-11. The ship landed in Kazakhstan at 0247 UTC Jun 25.

The undocking of Soyuz MS-11 marked the start of Expedition 60 under the command
of Aleksey Ovchinin.

On Jun 27 the Dextre robot arm was used to remove the Kaber deployer from the Kibo module airlock
and deploy DARPA's RED-EYE microsatellite, launched to ISS aboard Dragon CRS-17.

On Jul  3 the Kibo RMS extracted the NanoRacks NRCSD-16 payload from the Kibo airlock.
7 cubesats (described in JSR764) were deployed from NRCSD-16.


CZ-11H
------

China carried out its first sea-launched orbital attempt on Jun 5. A CZ-11H
(ocean version of the Chang Zheng 11) was launched from a barge in the Hwang Hai (Yellow Sea)
at 121.19E 34.90N. It carried seven satellites to a 560 x 585 km x 45.0 deg orbit.
The fourth stage and one other object were cataloged in a 270 x 634 km x 44.9 deg
orbit.

The payloads are:
 Jilin-1 Gaofen 03A, for Changguang Sat Tech Co. of Jilin province;
 Bufeng-1A and 1B, formation flying sats from CAST/Beijing for remote sensing of wind velocities.
 Tianxiang 1 and 2 (also called Zhongdian Wangtong 1A and 1B), 65 kg satellites for the China 
  Electronic Technology Group, 
  to test Ka-band intersatellite links and a space-based router. Also carrying multispectral camera and ADS-B.
 Xiaoxiang-1-04, from Tianyi Research Inst., has a 7-metre-resolution RGB camera and a deorbit sail.
 Tianqi-3 (also called Xingzhi Jiaoyu 1) built by Guodian Gaokeji for the Tao Zhixing Education Foundation,
   has a camera and an IoT relay payload.

As usual China and the US military space tracking team are not communicating, so we don't
know which tracked object (catalog number) corresponds to which satellite.

RCM
---

Canada's Radarsat Constellation Mission was launched on Jun 12. A Falcon
9 took off from a foggy Vandenberg and flew to sun-synchronous orbit.
The first stage landed back at Vandenberg's Landing Zone 4 while the
second stage deployed the three RCM satellites. RCM uses the Magellan
Aerospace MAC-200 bus previously used for the Cassiope mission; the
satellites have a wet mass of 1450 kg each and carry a 7-meter-long
C-band synthetic aperture radar. The SAR has a maximum resolution of 3m
with a 20 km swath, but can also operate in lower resolution modes down
to 100m resolution/500 km swath. Radarsat 1 operated from 1995 to 2013;
Radarsat 2 was launched in 2007 and will be replaced by the new trio.

Ariane 5
--------

Arianespace launched mission VA248,  launcher L5107, on Jun 20.
It carried two communication satellite payloads to geotransfer orbit.
Eutelsat 7C for Eutelsat S.A. is a Maxar 1300 satellite with an
all-electric xenon propulsion system and a Ku-band broadcast payload. 
T-16 for AT&T is an Airbus Eurostar 3000LX Hybrid of 6330 kg launch mass
and a Ku/Ka-band communications payload. T-16 was originally going to be
DirectTV-16 before DirecTV was absorbed into AT&T.

By Jul 3 T-16 was in geostationary orbit at 134.8W.

By Jul 3 E7C had begun slow orbit raising and was in a 1409 x 37079 km x 6.0 deg
orbit.

Beidou
------

On Jun 24 China's CALT launched Chang Zheng 3B no. Y60 with the No. 46
Beidou Navigation Satellite into geotransfer orbit. The payload is
made an apogee burn to a 55 degree inclined synchronous
orbit sometime prior to Jul 5, and is now in a 35730 x 35831 km x 55.0 deg
drift orbit.


STP-2
-----

SpaceX's third Falcon Heavy was launched at 0630 UTC on Jun 25 with the US Air Force Space Test Program's STP-2
paylaod cluster. The side boosters landed at Cape Canaveral's LZ1 and LZ2; the core stage nearly
landed 1240 km downrange on the OCISLY but just missed the ship. Musk reported that the hot, fast reentry
breached the engine bay and the center engine's thrust vector control failed, causing the stage to divert.
Even further downrange, one fairing half was recovered, landing in the net carried by the ship Ms. Tree.

Stage 2 entered a 305 x 850 km x 28.5 km orbit at 0638 UTC and deployed a series of payloads:

  0642 UTC  OCULUS-ASR for Michigan Tech, a 70 kg satellite with space surveillance calibration experiments.
  0649 UTC  PPOD-1 deployed the TEPCE 1/2 cubesat, two 1.5U cubesats with a 1 km tether.
  0654 UTC  PPOD-2 deployed Falconsat-7, a USAF Academy 3U cubesat with an experimental membrane-optic solar telescope
  0658 UTC  PPOD-3 deployed ARMADILLO, a U. Texas 3U cubesat to study the LEO dust environment
  0701 UTC  PPOD-4 deployed PSAT-2 and BRICSAT-2, US Naval Academy 1.5U amateur radio cubesats. BRICSAT (Ballistically
    Reinforced Cubesat) also has an electric thruster experiment. PSAT-1 and BRICSAT-1 were launched in 2015, but
    BRICSAT-1failed.
  0703 UTC  PPOD-5 deployed a 1.5U cubesat for US Special Operations Command, probably Prometheus-2.5.
            A dummy model of a second Prometheus was also in the deployer, replacing a satellite that was 
            transferred to another launch.
  0709 UTC  PPOD-6 deployed the 3U E-TBEX A  Enhanced Tandem Beacon Experiment, a 3U cubesat with tri-frequency
            ionospheric beacons to study ionospheric waves with high time resolution. The mission is lead by SRI
            and sponsored by NASA.
  0713 UTC  PPOD-7 deployed E-TBEX B.
  0720 UTC  PPOD-8 deployed Cal Poly's 2U CP9/LEO and Merritt Island High School's 1U Stangsat, which studied the
            launch vehicle and ejection environment.

At 0742 UTC the Falcon Heavy Stage 2 fired its engine to move to a 710 x 724 km x 24.0 deg orbit.
A series of small satellites were ejected in this second orbit.
  0749 UTC the 70 kg PROX-1 satellite from Georgia Tech was deployed. This satellite contains the Planetary Society's
             LightSail-2 solar sail cubesat which will be ejected and deployed in the coming weeks.
  0752 UTC came the 83 kg NPSAT1 for the Naval Postgraduate School. NPSAT1 carries ionospheric and technology experiments. 
  0754 UTC came the circa-100 kg-class OTB (Orbital Test Bed) for General Atomics (formerly SST-US). It carries
            the JPL Deep Space Atomic Clock and the Celestis Heritage capsule with the cremated remains of 152
            people (including astronaut W. Pogue and SF author Jayge Carr).
  0757 UTC GPIM, NASA-MSFC's Green Propellant Infusion Mission, was deployed. GPIM uses a Ball BCP-100 bus and
            has a mass of about 180 kg. It uses AF-M315E hydroxyl ammonium nitrate (NH3OHNO3) propellant proposed
            as a less toxic alternative to hydrazine.
  0801, 0804, 0806, 0809, 0813 and 0816 UTC, the six COSMIC-2 satellites were deployed in the order
            COSMIC 2-5, 2-6, 2-2, 2-4, 2-1, 2-3. The NOAA/NASA/Taiwan NSPO satellites carry a GPS-RO meteorology
            payload. They are successors to the six similar COSMIC-1 (FORMOSAT-3) satellites launched in April 2006.

At 0837 UTC Stage 2 made a further burn to reach an approximately 700 x 6000 km x 42.1 deg orbit. Delta-V
            of the burn was about 2700 m/s.
At 0957 UTC the fourth Stage 2 burn, over the equator at 140E, put the vehicle in a 6000 x 12000 km x 42.1 deg orbit
            with a delta-V of about 1360 m/s.
At 1004 UTC the 668 kg DSX satellite was deployed. The USAF STP payload carries space weather and technology experiments.
            After this, at around 1515 UTC, the 2nd stage reached perigee and underwent `passivation' (jettison
            of remaining propellants and safing of batteries).           
 LightSail-2 was ejected from PROX-1 at 0749 UTC on Jul 2.


Electron 7
----------

RocketLab launched its 7th Electron mission on Jun 29, placing the BlackSky Global 3 satellite
and at least 5 cubesat payloads in a 45 degree orbit. The payloads include two SpaceBee
satellites from Swarm Tech, two Prometheus cubesats for US Special Operations Command,
and ACRUX 1 for the Melbourne Space Program, a group of Australian students. An unidentified
payload was also aboard.


Meteor-M 2-2
-----------

Russia's Meteor-M No. 2-2 weather satellite was launched on Jul 5 by a Soyuz/Fregat from Vostochniy.
The Fregat stage deployed the 2900 kg Meteor in an 820 km orbit and then made two burns to enter a lower 580 km
orbit to release a batch of small satellites:

  ICEYE-X3 and ICEYE-X4, radar satellites for Finland's ICEYE, probably about 80 kg eahc.
  CarboNIX, a test satellite for EXOLAUNCH (formerly ECM) of Berlin, 30 kg.

Table of Recent Suborbital Launches
-----------------------------------

The launch of the DLR/SSC ATEK/MAPHEUS-8 from ESRANGE (Kiruna, Sweden) in June reportedly saw the introduction
of a new sounding rocket, the Improved Malemute/VS-30 (I haven't fully confirmed this yet, other sources
say it was just an ordinary VSB-30).

Jonathan's Space Report 
No. 769                                                       2019 Sep 22   Somerville, MA

International Space Station
---------------------------

Expedition 60 continues.

Soyuz MS-14, flying without a crew, completed a rendezvous with the ISS
at 0513 UTC on Aug 24. However, at 0532 UTC after a flyaround at a
distance of 400 metres, it failed to lock on to the Kurs system on the
Poisk module. It was later determined that Poisk's system was not
working correctly. The crew sent the abort signal at 0536 UTC and the
Soyuz was ordered to retreat to a safe distance.

On Aug 26 astronauts Skvortsov, Parmitano and Morgan undocked from the
Zvezda module in Soyuz MS-13 at 0335 UTC and redocked with the Poisk
module at 0359 UTC. This left the Zvezda module, with its working Kurs
system, free for a second docking attempt for Soyuz MS-14.
On Aug 27 at 0308 UTC Soyuz MS-14 indeed succeeded in docking with the
Zvezda aft port, delivering cargo and the Fyodor robot.

On Aug 27 the Canadarm-2 unberthed Dragon CRS-18 from the Harmony nadir
port and released it into orbit at 1459 UTC. Dragon fired its Draco
thrusters for a 12m53s deorbit burn at 1922 UTC and splashed down at
about 123.6W 32.5N at 2021 UTC.

The Fyodor robot was loaded back into Soyuz MS-14 along with some
return cargo and Soyuz MS-14 undocked from Zvezda at 1814 UTC Sep 6,
landing in Kazakhstan at 2132 UTC to complete its test flight.

Robotic operations were carried on Sep 3 to Sep 5 on two Main Bus
Switching Units (MBSUs). MSBU 3 (S/N X700385) was brought inside Kibo
from ELC-2 for repairs and then returned outside to ESP-2. MBSU 1 (S/N
C250636) was brought inside Kibo from ESP-2 and will be returned to
Earth on the next Dragon flight.



Cygnus NG-11
------------

On Aug 29 the Aerocube-10a satellite, released from Cygnus NG-11, itself
released its first atmospheric probe, labelled Venturini in the US satellite
catalog.

On Sep 16 Cygnus NG-11 released the Seeker cubesat, which was designed to
perform proximity operations with Cygnus.

Geo-IK
-------

On Aug 30 Russia launched the Geo-IK-2 No. 13L (Nusson-2 No. 13L, codename Kosmos-2540)
geodetic satellite.

KX-09
-----

KX-09 is a Chinese Academy of Sciences microgravity research satellite, launched on the
small Kuaizhou-1A launcher. A 6U cubesat from Tianyi Research, Xiaoxiang-1 07 xing, was
also aboard.

ZY-1
----

The 1840 kg Ziyuan-1 02D xing imaging satellite was launched on Sep 12 by CZ-4B. The launch
also carried two small satellites: Jingshi 1 is a 16 kg imaging satellite from Beijing
Normal University; Jinniuzuo naxing is a 3U cubesat from Shanghai ASES Spaceflight Technology
Co Ltd which is testing a drag sail.


Zhuhai-1 Group 3
----------------

The Zhuhai yiaho 03 zu (Zhuhai-1 Group 3) cluster was launched by CZ-11 on Sep 19.
The cluster consists of one video satellite and four hyperspectral imaging satellites
for the Zhuhai Orbital company. Each satellite has a name to commemorate a sponsor:
     
    Sat     Name                    Sponsor

    OVS-3   Chunlei Jihua Zhixing   Zhuhai Orbit Co, China Children and Teens Foundation
    OHS-3A  Xiahaian 1              West Coast New District Govt, Qindao, Shandong Prov.
    OHS-3B  Feitian Maotai          Guizhou Maotai Distillery Co.
    OHS-3C  Gaomi-1                 Gaomi City Govt, Shandong Prov.
    OHS-3D  GuoyuanV9               Jiangsu Jinshiyuan Wine Co Ltd.

Chandrayaan-2
-------------

The Vikram lander separated from the Chandrayaan-2 Orbiter at 0745 UTC
Sep 2. It carried out a landing attempt on Sep 6, but lost attitude and
contact at an altitude of 2.3 km. It appears that Vikram impacted the
surface at about 2023 UTC not far from the planned landing iste at 70.9S
22.7E.

Hayabusa-2
----------

On Sep 16 Hayabusa-2 released two 10-cm-diameter target markers (TM-E at 1617 UTC
and TM-C at 1624 UTC) about 1 km above the surface of Ryugu. The spacecraft is observing
the target markers as they descend slowly in Ryugu's weak gravitational field. The
TMs are expected to impact the surface by Sep 23.

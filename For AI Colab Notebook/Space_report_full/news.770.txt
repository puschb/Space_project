IAC 2019
--------

I'll be at the IAC 2019 conference in Washington, D.C. I hope to meet some of you there!

Catalog of Deep Space Objects
-----------------------------

The US satellite catalog is pretty comprehensive for artificial objects
in Earth orbit below an altitude of 50,000 km. Beyond that it is less
reliable, and beyond 150,000 km it is seriously incomplete. At 150,000
km lunar perturbations are large enough that Keplerian orbits stop being
a good long term approximation.

No-one is officially responsible for knowing what hardware is in
heliocentric orbit or on the other planets, despite the planetary
protection concerns. 

As a start to fixing that, I present version 1.0 of DEEPCAT, the Catalog
of Deep Space Objects:

International Space Station
---------------------------

Expedition 61 began at 0737 UTC on Oct 3.

On Sep 24 the 8th H-II Transfer Vehicle (HTV), Kounotori 8 (HTV-8), was
placed in LEO by an H-IIB vehicle from Tanegashima. It carries another
set of replacement batteries for the station truss. HTV-8 arrived at the
station on Sep 28; it was grappled by Canadarm-2 at 1112 UTC and berthed
on the Harmony nadir port at 1409 UTC.

On Sep 25 astronauts Oleg Skripochka (Roskosmos), Jessica Meir (NASA), and
Hazza al Mansouri (United Arab Emirates) were launched into orbit aboard Soyuz MS-15
(Soyuz spacecraft 744). The launch vehicle was Soyuz-FG No. 71, the last of the Soyuz-FG
series. Future missions will use the Soyuz-2 series rockets.

Soyuz MS-15 docked with the ISS Zvezda module at 1942 UTC Sep 25 after a 5 hour 45 min flight.

On Sep 29-Oct 1 the Canadarm-2 and the JEM RMS arm were used to move the Exposed Pallet EP-8
from HTV-8 to the Mobile Base System POA, and to move EP-7 from the POA to HTV-8.
EP-7 had been stored on the POA for the past year.

On Oct 3 at 0737 UTC Soyuz MS-12 undocked from the Rassvet module with astronauts Ovchinin,
Hague and Al Mansoori. Soyuz fired its deorbit engine at 1006 UTC; the three modules
separated at 1034 UTC, and the descent module landed near 47 24N 69 34E in Kazakhstan
at 1059 UTC.

On Oct 4 the Canadarm-2 took EP-8 off the POA again and moved it next to
the P6 truss in preparation for spacewalk operations. On Oct 6
astronauts Koch and Morgan, in roles EV-1 and EV-2 and using suits 3004 and 3008 respectively, carried
out US EVA-56. The Quest airlock was depressurized at 1132 UTC and the hatch was
opened at 1138 UTC.  The astronauts then made the following transfers:
  NiH battery 0087 was removed from P6 IEA 2B slot 1 at 1306 UTC and installed on EP8 Slot X at 1339 UTC.
  Li-ion battery 0015 was moved from EP8 Slot A to P6 IEA 2B slot 1 from 1406 to 1422 UTC
  NiH battery 0093 was moved from P6 IEA 2B slot 2 to EP8 Slot A from 1444 to 1530 UTC.
  Adapter plate SN09 (?) was moved from EP8 Slot A to P6 IEA 2B slot 2 from 1522 to 1550 UTC.
  NiH battery 0096 was moved from P6 IEA 2B slot 3 to slot 2, on top of the adapter plate, from 1610 to 1616 UTC.
  Li-ion battery 0005 was moved from EP8 Slot B to P6 IEA 2B slot 3 from 1648 to 1716 UTC.
The astronauts then returned to the airlock with hatch closure at 1835 UTC and repressurization at 1840 UTC.

On Oct 11 US EVA-57 featured Koch and Morgan, this time swapping roles as EV-2 and EV-1. 
Quest was depressurized from 1134 to 1823 UTC and the hatch was open from 1137 UTC to 1814 UTC.
During the spacewalk:
  NiH battery 0099 was moved from P6 2B slot 4 to EP8 slot B from 1230 to 1312 UTC.
  Adapter plate SN10? was moved from EP8 slot B to P6 2B slot 4 from 1304 to 1317 UTC.
  NiH battery 0100 was moved from P6 2B slot 6 to the adapter plate in slot 4 from 1350 to 1354 UTC.
  Li-ion battery SN17 was moved from EP8 slot D to P6 2B slot 6 from 1421 to 1438 UTC.
  NiH battery 0097 was moved from P6 2B slot 5 to EP8 slot D from 1503 to 1550 UTC.
  Adapter plate SN12 was moved from EP8 slot D to P6 2B slot 5 from 1543 to 1553 UTC.
This completed the work on P6's 2B side, with three Li-ion batteries and 3 adapter plates installed,
four NiH batteries moved to the EP for disposal and two NiH batteries stored on top of adapter plates.

Following the failure of the 2B2 battery charge/discharge unit (BCDU) on
the P6 2B IEA, US EVA-58 with Koch and Meir was added to replace the
BCDU with a spare from ELC-1. The airlock was depressurized at 1132 UTC,
and the hatch opened at 1137 UTC. 

Koch amd Meir moved spare BCDU 0028 from ELC1 at 1305 UTC and installed
in in P6 in the 2B2 slot at 1501 UTC. Failed BCDU 011 was removed from
P6 2B2 at 1452 UTC and brought back to the airlock at 1557 UTC.
Following some further minor tasks the crew returned to the airlock with
hatch close at 1851 UTC and beginning of repressurization at 1855 UTC.
This was the first spacewalk in which all of the spacewalkers were
women.


Beidou
------

Two Beidou-3 MEO satellites, M23/24 (DW47/48), were launched to 12-hour orbits on Sep 22.

Yunhai-1-02
-----------

China launched the second Yunhai-1 satellite on Sep 25. The satellite carries
a GNSS radio occultation meteorology payload.

EKS No. 3
----------

Russia launched the third EKS (Tundra) early warning satellite on Sep 26.
The satellite is built by RKK Energia, with overall system integration by Kometa.
It was given the codename Kosmos-2541.

Gaofen 10
---------

The second Gaofen 10 high resolution imaging satellite was launched from Taiyuan on Oct 4
into a 0200LT node sun-synch orbit. The first GF-10 failed to reach orbit in 2016.


Tsubame
--------

The Tsubame (SLATS) low orbit test satellite reentered on Oct 1. Its final orbit was 133 x 147 km.

Kosmos-2535/2536
----------------

Kosmos-2535 and 2536 continue proximity operations. Kosmos-2537 and Kosmos-2538
(objects B and C but we're not sure which is which) have not changed orbit, but in 
October several new objects were cataloged in a similar orbit and appear to have
been released from objects B and/or C around Oct 11. They may be debris objects
from a minor collision or sub-payloads for radar calibration (like the ESO test objects
released from the Romb and Kol'tso satellites in the past).


MEV-1/Eutelsat 5WB
------------------

International Launch Services and Khrunichev launched a Proton to supersynchronous transfer
orbit on Oct 9 and deployed two payloads built by Northrop Grumman/Dulles (formerly Orbital Sciences).
Eutelsat W5B is a television satellite for the European operator Eutelsat SA. MEV-1, the Mission
Extension Vehicle, is a Northrop Grumman experimental satellite which will rendezvous and dock with 
the Intelsat 901 satellite in GEO in order to extend its operational lifetime.

ICON
----

NASA's Ionospheric Connection Explorer, ICON, was launched on Oct 11. The Northrop Grummann
L-1011 Stargazer carrier aircraft took off from Cape Canaveral's runway 31/13 (the Skid Strip)
at 0031 UTC. After an aborted drop run at 0130 UTC, the L-1011 dropped Pegasus at 29.0N 78.5W
at 0200 UTC. The three-stage solid rocket ignited after a 5 second free fall, and reached orbit 11 minutes later.
ICON has an optical interferometer, ultraviolet imagers and an ion velocity meter to study the thermosphere
and ionosphere.

Palisade
--------

AstroDigital's 16U technology development cubesat Palisade was launched by Electron flight 9 (mission
name As The Crow Flies) into Electron's highest orbit yet. The satellite was placed in a 1207 x 1225 km orbit,
with the second stage and two pieces of debris in a 309 x 1200 km x 87.9 deg orbit. The kick stage
was deorbited.

TJS 4
-----

Tongxing Jishu Shiyan 4 was launched from Xichang on Oct 17 to geotransfer orbit. The satellite
is described as a communications techology satellite, but may be a signals intelligence satellite.

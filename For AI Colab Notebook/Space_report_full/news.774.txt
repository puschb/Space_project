International Space Station
---------------------------

Expedition 61 continues.

On Dec 23 the BCDU FRAM (the adapter for the recently used spare BCDU) was moved
from the Dextre EOTP to the CRS-19 Dragon trunk, where it will be destroyed on
reentry.

On around Dec 27, the failed MSBU S/N C250636 (brought inside on Sep 5) and
the failed BCDU S/N 011 (brought inside on Oct 18)  were transferred to the CRS-19
Dragon's cabin for return to Earth.

On Dec 27 at 0128 and 0436 UTC the Progress MS-13 cargo ship docked to the Pirs module
fired its engines to raise the ISS orbit from 411 x 422 km to 415 x 422 km.

On Jan 3 to 4 the Dextre arm was used to transfer the Space Debris
Sensor (SDS) and SOLAR payloads from the Columbus external payload
facility to external attachment points on the PCM module of the S.S.
Alan Bean (Cygnus NG-12) cargo ship for reentry disposal. SDS was
launched in 2017 on Dragon CRS-13, but failed in Jan 2018. SOLAR was
launched on STS-122 in 2008. On Jan 6 a Resupply Stowage Platform 
(possibly RSP 1008/SE177, launched on STS-131) was moved from the PMM1D3
rack location to the Bean's pressurized module for disposal.

On Jan 7 at about 0500 UTC the Canadarm-2 unberthed the Dragon CRS-19
ship from the Harmony module. Dragon was released back into orbit at
1005 UTC, and performed three separation burns between 1008 and 1020
UTC. The plume from one of those firings  was reported to have made the
Cygnus NG-12 solar arrays wobble, which is something one tries to avoid.
Dragon fired its thrusters to deorbit at 1451 UTC until 1504 UTC,
jettisoned the trunk section at 1508 UTC and entered the atmosphere at
1524 UTC with splashdown near 121.0W 31.2N at 1542 UTC.

On Jan 15 astronauts Koch and Meir, in suits EMU 3004 and 3008, made
spacewalk US EVA-62 to continue battery replacements from the EP8 pallet
to the P6 truss 4B channel. The airlock was depressurized from 1130 to
1904 UTC. Transfers made were:

 NiH 0104 from P6 4B1 to EP8-Z
 Li-ion 21 from  EP8-F to P6 4B1
 NiH 0106 from P6-4B2 to EP8-F
 Adapter plate 0014 from EP8-F to P6 4B2
 NiH 0101 from P6-4B3 to P6-4B2 on top of the adapter plate
 Li-ion 22 from EP8-E to P6-4B3
 NiH 0103 from P6-4B4 tp EP8-Y

On Jan 20  Meir and Koch completed the P6 4B battery work with US EVA-63. The airlock
was depressurized from 1127 to 1833 UTC. Transfers made were:
 Adapter plate 0013 from EP8-E to P6-4B4
 NiH 0098 from P6-4B6 to P6-4B4 on top of the adapter plate
 Li-ion 23 from EP8-C to P6-4B6
 NiH 0102 from P6-4B5 to EP8-C
 Adapter plate 0011? from EP8-C to P6-4B5

On Jan 23 at 1415 and 1723 UTC Progress MS-13 fired its engines to
raise the ISS orbit by about 1 km. 

On Jan 25 astronauts Morgan (EV1/EMU 3004) and Parmitano (EV2/EMU 3008)
made US spacewalk EVA-64 to complete repairs to the AMS-02 experiment.
The airlock was depressurized from 1158 to 1820 UTC. The crew performed
leak checks on the new cooling system. Leaks were found in cooling line
number 5, and after a couple of cycles of tightening the connector the
leak was stopped. An insulation `tent' was placed over the system. After
the AMS-02 work, camera lens covers on the CP8 and CP9 external cameras
were removed.


CZ-5
----

China's largest rocket, the Chang Zheng 5, made a successful third flight on Dec 27,
after a major engine rework following the failure of the second flight in July 2017.
The CZ-5 second stage put the Shi Jian 20 communications satellite in supersync
transfer orbit. SJ-20 was on station in GEO at 115E by Jan 6.

Jilin-1 KF-1
------------

On Jan 15 China's SAST launched a CZ-2D with Chuanguang's biggest
satellite to date, the 1.5t Jilin-1 Kuanfu-1. The rocket also placed
three smaller satellites in orbit, two Satellogic Nusat imagers (Sophie
and Marie)  and Guodian Gaokeji's Tianqi-5.

Ariane 5
--------

On Jan 16 Arianespace launched another Ariane 5ECA, putting Eutelsat Konnect
and GSAT-30 in geotransfer orbit. Eutelsat Konnect is a Ka-band payload
for the European operator Eutelsat; GSAT-30 is a Ku/C band satellite
for the Indian space agency ISRO.


Starlink
--------

The third launch of 60 Starlink satellites, V1.0 Batch 2, was orbited on Jan 7.

As I have previously reported, the unexpected brightness of Starlink
satellites has caused widespread concern among astronomers. Thousands of
such satellites could dominate the visible view of the night sky in dark
areas; the bright satellites crossing the field of view of astronomical
detectors could cause bright streaks, electronic cross-talk and `ghost
images' compromising deep exposures of faint objects. At a meeting of
the American Astronomical Society in January,  SpaceX representatives
seemed confident they would be able to reduce the brightness of future
satellites so that they would no longer be naked eye objects, and
expressed committment to iterative improvements to address the concerns
of professional astronomers. I welcome the willingness of SpaceX to address
the issue (nevertheless, I do think some formal regulations on light pollution
are needed, because other constellations will also be an issue).

The latest launch includes a modified satellite, Starlink 1130, with a
special dark coating  on the bus to reduce its brightness. This
satellite will be used to improve SpaceX's models of satellite light
scattering, allowing engineers to evaluate design improvements for
future versions of the satellite. 

It will be important to get visual magnitude estimates of Starlink 1130
once it reaches its operational orbit. 

As with V1.0 Batch 1, the 60 satellites were split into three groups,
with orbit raising of two of the groups pausing at 350 km to precess to
different orbital planes.

Stage 2 of the Falcon 9 was deorbited south of Australia, reentering
at approximately 0448 UTC Jan 7 after 1.6 orbits.


The fourth launch, V1.0-L3, placed a further 60 satellites in 280 km
orbit on Jan 29.


TJS 5
------

On Jan 7 China launched the Tongxing Jishu Shiyan 5 satellite to
geotransfer orbit. The TJS series of `experimental communications
satellites' is believed to be a cover for a range of military programs,
and TJS 5 appears to be an SAST/Shanghai `Houyan' early warning
satellite like 2017's TJS 2.

Crew Dragon
-----------

Crew Dragon C205 was launched from KSC LC39A at 1530 UTC Jan 19 on a Falcon 9
for the Inflight Abort Test.

A preplanned shutdown of core stage B1046 at 90s into flight triggered
an inflight abort and the Super Draco thrusters pushed Dragon to a 44 km apogee
followed by a parachute-aided splashdown in the Atlantic. The Falcon 9
disintegrated in flight 7 seconds after separation.

Spitzer
-------

SIRTF, the Space Infrared Telescope Facility, was launched in Aug 2003.
In Dec 2003 it was renamed the Spitzer Space Telescope, the 4th and last
of the Great Observatories program. After 16 years of great science,
Spitzer entered final safemode and fell silent at 2215:45 UTC Jan 30.

IRAS/POPPY-5B
-------------

On Jan 29 at 2339 UTC two defunct satellites had a very near miss -
probably  less than 100 metres apart. The IRAS astronomical satellite,
which operated from 1983 to 1985, and the NRO/NRL POPPY 5B signals
intelligence satellite (codenamed GGSE 4), which operated from 1967 to
1972, passed each other at a relative velocity of 14.7 km/s.

Errata
------

Danna Barnett informs me that Tyvak-0092 is actually built for Israel's Elbit Systems
and not for an Italian company. Elbit calls the satellite NANOVA; it has a UHF comm
payload.

The dual-engine Centaur on the Atlas V N22 uses the RL10-A4-2 engine, not RL10-A4-1.

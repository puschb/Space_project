General Catalog of Artifical Space Objects
-------------------------------------------

The first full release of my General Catalog of Artifical Space Objects (GCAT) is now available
at https://planet4589.org/space/gcat 

International Space Station
---------------------------

Expedition 63 continues.

Astronauts Hurley and Behnken returned to Earth aboard Dragon C206 Endeavour on Aug 2.
Dragon undocked from IDA-2 at 2335 UTC Aug 1. At 0549 UTC Aug 2 a phasing burn of about
37m/s lowered perigee to circa 280 km. The trunk was jettisoned at 1752 UTC and Dragon
began its 11 min 22 s, 70 m/s deorbit burn at 1756 UTC, lowering perigee further to
about 42 km. The spacecraft nosecone was closed at 1810 UTC and the capsule reached
entry interface at 1836 UTC. Descending on four main parachutes, Dragon splashed
down in the Pensacola recovery zone in the Gulf of Mexico at 87.6W 29.8N at about
1847:48 UTC completing a flight lasting 63 days 23 hr 25 min 3s. The capsule was
retrieved by the SpaceX ship Go Navigator at 1917 UTC.

This was the first time since 1976 Oct 16 (Soyuz-23) that a space crew returned
from orbit to a water landing (splashdown).

Dragon's trunk was cataloged in a 279 x 407 km orbit the day after landing.

The final HTV cargo ship, Kounotori 9, was unberthed from the ISS
Harmony nadir port at 1351 UTC Aug 18 and released into orbit by
Canadarm-2 at 1736 UTC. On Aug 20, after orbit lowering burns at 0040
and 0211 UTC it performed the deorbit burn at 0640 UTC Aug 20 and
entered the atmosphere at about 0707 UTC over the Pacific. It burnt up
on reentry. The EP-8 pallet, with discarded ISS batteries, was aboard.


Mars 2020
---------

NASA's Mars 2020 mission was launched from Cape Canaveral by a ULA Atlas
V 541, mission AV-088, on Jul 30. Launch was at 1150 UTC, with parking
orbit insertion at 1201 UTC into a 167 x 250 km x 29.1 deg orbit. At
1235 UTC the Centaur stage restarted to accelerate the vehicle to an
escape hyperbola with C3 = 14.49 km2/s2.

The Mars 2020 spacecraft consists of the cruise stage (mass about 539
kg; 0.6m high 4.4m dia cylinder) and the entry vehicle. The entry
vehicle is 4.5m dia with a backshell, parachute, and aeroshell (heat
shield), containing the Perseverance Rover (1025 kg, 2.1m x 1.5m). The
backshell is about 294 kg, the heat shield 382 kg, and the 21.5m
diameter parachute is 55 kg. Perseverance is similar in design to
Curiosity.

Attached to the rover is the Ingenuity Mars Helicopter, a 1.8 kg
1.2m-span technology-test rotorcraft, contained within the MHDS (Mars
Helicopter Delivery System) cover, which will be jettisoned from the
rover. The helicopter will make 90-second flights up to 5 metres
altitude.

Mars 2020 will reach Mars in Feb 2021.

Ekspress
--------

On Jul 30 Russia's Khrunichev launched a Proton-M  carrying two Ekspress communications
satellites for the Russian space communications company Kosmicheskaya Svyaz'. The Briz-M
upper stage made five burns on an 18 hour trip to deploy the payloads in a low-inclination
supersynchronous transfer orbit. The DTB propellant tank was left in
an intermediate 416 x 23275 km x 49.5 deg orbit after the third burn.
My guess for the various intermediate orbits is:

 Jul 30 2141 UTC   182 x 182 km x 51.6 deg
 Jul 30 2205 UTC   275 x 3000 km? x 50.3 deg
 Jul 31 0000 UTC   416 x 23275 km x 49.5 deg
 Jul 31 0641 UTC   450?x 54800?km x 47? deg
 Jul 31 1523 UTC   16689 x 54900 km x 0.6 deg


The two Ekspress-1000N satellites were built by ISS Reshetnev
(Zheleznogorsk) with C/Ku/L-band communications payloads by Thales
Alenia.

Ariane triple payload
----------------------

Arianespace's latest Ariane 5 launch placed three satellites in geotransfer orbit.
Intelsat's Galaxy 30 is a Northrop Grummann GeoStar-2.4E with C, Ku, Ka, and L-band
communications payloads. BSAT/Tokyo's BSAT-4b is a Maxar 1300 Ku-band broadcasting satellite.
The thid payload is Mission Extension Vehicle 2 (MEV-2), built by Northrop Grumman for its
subsidiary Space Logistics LLC. MEV-2 will dock with an Intelsat satellite to extend its life.


Starlink
--------

The 10th Starlink launch, V1.0-9, carried 57 Starlinks and two BlackSky Global imaging sats
to orbit on Aug 7. The Falcon 9 first stage (B1051 on its 5th flight) landed on the OCISLY.
Launch was at 0512 UTC with a 170 x 400? km parking orbit insertion at 0521 UTC, restart at 0559 UTC to
a 386 x 403 km x 53.0 deg orbit, deployment of Global-7 and Global-8 at 0613 and 0618 UTC, and
release of the Starlink satellites at 0645 UTC. Stage 2 was later deorbited.
Four deployment rods and one rideshare adapter were cataloged as debris objects.

The 11th launch, V1.0-10, was on Aug 18. It carried 58 Starlinks and three SkySat satellites for Planet.
Insertion was to a 216 x 360 km x 53.0 deg orbit.

GaoFen 9
--------

Two more GaoFen 9 imaging satellites, No. 4 and No 5, were launched on Aug 6 and 23.
Launched with GF9-4 is Tsinghua University's Gravity and Atmosphere Science Satellite (Zhongli yu Daqi Kexue
Weixing). With GF9-5 were launched Tiantuo 5 from NUDT/Changsha and the Multipurpose Experiment
Satellite (Duogongneng Shiyan Weixing, DGSW) from the Military Academy in Beijing.

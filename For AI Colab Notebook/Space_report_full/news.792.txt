International Space Station
---------------------------

On Apr 23 at 0949:02 UTC SpaceX launched a Falcon 9 from Kennedy Space
Center LC39A with the Dragon SpX Crew-2 mission. Booster B1061, on its
2nd flight, landed on the droneship Of Course I Still Love You. The
second stage reached a 190 x 213 km x 51.6 deg orbit 8m49s after launch
The Crew Dragon payload consists of Crew Dragon capsule C206
"Endeavour", on its second flight, and a new Crew Dragon Trunk (the 4th)
on its first and only flight. Aboard C206 were astronauts Shane
Kimbrough (NASA), Megan McArthur (NASA), Akihiko Hoshide (JAXA) and Thomas Pesquet (ESA).
The second stage was deorbited on the first orbit and reentered west of Australia.

Endeavour reached a rendezvous with the ISS at a range of 400 metres at 0820 UTC Apr 24,
and docked with the IDA-2/PMA-2 port at 0908 UTC.

On May 2 at 0035 UTC Resilience undocked from IDA-3/PMA-3 with the
Crew-1 astronauts Hopkins, Glover, Noguchi, and Walker. Resilience made
burns at 0040, 0128, 0214 and 0407 UTC lowering its orbit slightly to
about 400 km. At 0558 UTC the Dragon trunk was jettisoned into a 406 x
411 km orbit. The SpaceX commentary implied the trunk and the deorbit
propellant total 6000 lb (about 2700 kg) and the Dragon entry mass was
21000 lb (9500 kg); since I estimate the deorbit prop needed to be about
 400 kg, that would imply the trunk mass is a surprisingly large 2300
kg.

Dragon's deorbit burn was frmom 0603:12 to 0619:39 UTC and decreased the spaceship's
velocity by 115.2m/s; entry interface was at 0645 UTC and the vehicle splashed down off the
coast of Panama City, Florida, near 86.0W 29.75N, at about 0656:43 UTC May 2.

OneWeb
------

36 OneWeb satellites were launched on Apr 25 aboard a Soyuz from
Vostochniy into a 444 x 454 km x 87.4 deg parking orbit.

USA 314
--------

On Apr 26 United Launch Alliance launched a Delta 4 Heavy from
Vandenberg AFB's Space Launch Complex 6 on mission NROL-82. The rocket
placed a heavy National Reconnaissance Office payload codenamed USA 314
in a 525 x 758 km x 98.0 deg, 1300 LTDN sun-synchronous orbit. USA 314
is thought to be a version of the CRYSTAL imaging space satellite.

CZ-6
----

China's SAST launched  Chang Zheng 6 no. Y5 from Taiyuan on Apr 27, placing 9 satellites in 
a 1030 LTDN sun-synch orbit:

  Qilu-1, radar imaging satellite for the Shandong Industrial Technology Research Institute.

  Qilu-4, optical imaging satellite for the Shandong Industrial Technology Research Institute.

  Foshan-1 is an imaging satellite for Jihua Labs in Foshan; it's not
  clear whether they also built the satellite. Jihua Labs appears to be operated by the
  Guandong provincial government.

  Taijing 2-01, an imaging sat from Weina Xingkong Co. (MinoSpace).

  Tianqi 09; IoT comms sat for Guodian Gaokeji, built by Shanghai ASES. 

  Zhongan Guotong 1 (also called Hangsheng 1), from Zhongan Guotong Sat Tech Dev Co (Shenzhen) and
  Hunan Hangsheng Satellite Technology (Changsha). 
  Satellite for real time imaging and data transmission.

  NEO-1, from Shenzhen Origin Space Tech Co. Ltd., with an imager (perhaps
  for asteroid surveys, or just a test version for now?) and an active
  debris removal experiment (with a target and a net, like RemoveDebris).

  Jin Zijing ('Golden Bauhinia') 1-01 and 1-02): two imaging sats from
  Lingzhong Kongjian Jishu (Beijing Zero G Lab). Previously the  G.
  Bauhinia constellation was associated with Hong Kong Aerospace Tech
  Group, unless that's an unrelated system with the same name.  JZ-1-02 is also
  called Lingque-1 D02. 

Vega VV18
---------

Arianespace's light Vega launcher made a successful return to flight with launch
of the Pleiades Neo 3 imaging satellite for Airbus Space and Defense - Intelligence.
The AVUM upper stage then lowered its orbit by 15 km and deployed NorSat-3 for the
Norwegian Space Centre, Bravo for Aurora Insight, ELO Alpha for Eutelsat, and
two Lemur satellites for Spire Global. The Vega AVUM stage was deorbited
over the Indian Ocean west of Australia at 0425 UTC Apr 29.

Intiially no orbital data were released for Pleiades Neo 3, but TLEs became
available on Mar 3 showing it in a 624 x 626 km x 97.9 deg, 1030 LT SSO.
Although it is a commercial imagery satellite, military intelligence may be
one if its major customers.


Tianhe
-------

The Tianhe core module for China's new Tiangong-3 space station was
launched from Wenchang on Apr 29. The 22600 kg module was placed in
orbit by a CZ-5B rocket. separating from the  empty 21200 kg core stage
at 0331 UTC.

About 5 minutes later, both the module and the core stage passed only
300 km from the International Space Station, which is rather close to
come given that there was no coordination between CALT and NASA on the
launch trajectory. This close pass appears deliberate given that really
careful timing was needed to achieve it.

The large 21-tonne CZ-5B core stage was left in 170 x 375 km orbit, and
after 10 days in orbit reentered over Saudi Arabia at about 0214 UTC May
9, just after passing directly over Riyadh. Its debris fell in the 
Indian Ocean near the Maldives about 10 minutes later.

This is the second CZ-5B launch; the core stage reentries from these
launches are the largest deliberate uncontrolled reentries in over 30
years. Other rockets with large core stages are designed to avoid
leaving the stages in orbit. The previous CZ-5B reentry resulted in tons
of metal slamming into the ground in the Ivory Coast, fortunately
causing only limited damage to buildings but understandably scaring
quite a few people. I consider the decision of CALT to design the CZ-5B
to leave a 21t inert core stage in low orbit on each launch to be
negligent, and a contrast to the standard practice of other space
agencies.

Starlink
---------

60 more Starlinks were launched from Cape Canaveral on Apr 29. The Falcon 9 first stage
landed on the JRTI droneship.

Another 60 were launched on May 4 from Kennedy Space Center, with the first stage landing on OCISLY.

A further 60 were launched on May 9 from Cape Canaveral, with the first stage (B1051 on a record
tenth flight) landing on JRTI.

Yaogan 34 and 30-08
-------------------

China launched the Yaogan 34 satellite on Apr 30 to a 1000 km orbit, 
The orbital height and orbital plane of the satellite is matched to the
three Yaogan 31 group 02 satellites.

On May 6 China launched three Yaogan-30 signals intelligence satellites, Group 8 nos, 1-3.
The Guodian Gaokeji commercial communications satellite Tianqi-12 was carreid as a secondary payload.

Ingenuity
---------

The Ingenuity Mars Helicopter made its third flight on Apr 25 at 0831 UTC. It reached 5m
altitude and went 50m downrange, then returned to its starting point and
landed after an 81s flight. Flight 4, at 1439 UTC Apr 30, went 133m south and returned,
also at 5 m altitude, in a 117 second flight.

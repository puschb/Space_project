International Space Station
---------------------------

On May 4 and 5 the Dextre robot arm was used to move an old NiH battery pack
(possibly S/N 0072) and its FRAM adapter from External Stowage Platform
3 Site 6 to the external attach area on the Cygnus cargo ship S.S.
Katherine Johnson. The battery will be destroyed with the ship when it
is eventually deorbited over the Pacific.

On Jun 2 astronauts Novitskiy and Dubrov made a spacewalk from the Poisk module
in spacesuits Orlan MKS-5 and MKS-4 respectively. During the spacewalk the Pirs
module was decommissioned and prepared for future removal from ISS.
The Poisk airlock was depressurized at 0525 UTC and the hatch was opened from 0553 to 0555 UTC.
The astronauts installed a commemorative kit for the Energiya company on a handrail
outside Poisk. They then took a pressurized container from Poisk to Zarya. The container
had the new SP RRZh flow regulator inside; the regulator was swapped with the failed one
on Zarya, which was sealed inside the container. The container was stowed on Poisk and
then later, at 1056 UTC, jettisoned into space. It was cataloged 
with international designation 1998-067SK; I believe it has a mass of about 50 kg.
The GStM-2 crane was moved from Pirs to Poisk. The Kurs AFU cabling was disconnected
from Poisk and reconnected to Zarya. A `gap spanner' ladder between Pirs and Zvezda was
removed (and taken inside?). Finally, two exposure experiment packages, in the 'Vinoslivost' and
'Test' series, were installed outside the Poisk airlock.
The Poisk airlock hatch was closed at 1312 UTC.

I'm not sure when the new flow regulator and container were launched, but I'm guessing it
was on Progress MS-15. 

On Jun 3 SpaceX launched cargo ship Dragon CRS-22 from Kennedy Space Center. The B1067 first
stage, on its first flight, landed on the droneship OCISLY. The second stage was deorbited
south of Australia. CRS-22 carries the 2B/4B IROSA solar array package in its unpressurized
trunk section. The array package has a mass of 1380 kg.

A second object was cataloged from the CRS-22 launch in a 209 x 545 km orbit; it appears
to be a small debris object of unknown origin, maybe something minor that came off stage 2 during
the deorbit burn. Sources have confirmed that the Falcon  9 second stage deorbit was
successful.


Tianwen-1
----------

The Chinese Tianwen-1 probe has made the country's first successful landing on Mars, on May 14.
The Tianwen-1 Orbiter made an orbit adjust at 1717 UTC to lower its orbit around
Mars from 277 x 57761 km x 88.7 deg to -37 x 57040 km x 89.2 deg. At about 2000 UTC
the Tianwen-1 Lander separated from the Orbiter; and at 2054 UTC the Orbiter then raised
periares again to return to a safe 431 x 57591 km x 89.2 deg orbit. The Lander then descended, beginning
atmospheric entry at 2254 UTC at an altitude of 125 km, a velocity of 4.8 km/s and
an entry angle of -11.2 degrees. At about 2259 UTC the main parachute deployed, and then the
heat shield was jettisoned. The backshell and parachute separated about a minute later
and rocket-powered descent began, leading to a landing at 109.7E 25.1N on Utopia Planitia at 2301 UTC.
The signal from the landing was received on Earth at 2318 UTC after a light travel time of 17m 44s.

On May 17 at about 0025 UTC the orbiter lowered its apogee, reaching a 259 x 12572 km x 89.2 deg orbit
to begin its new role as a communications relay.

The above analysis uses the excellent work of Daniel Estevez and the AMSAT-DL team, as well as data
from Scott Tilley.

Starlink and OneWeb
--------------------

52 Starlink satellites were launched on May 9 to a higher than usual deployment orbit.
Two rideshare satellites were carried: Capella 6, a radar imaging satellite for Capella Space,
and Tyvak-0130, a 6U cubesat for Tyvak and Lawrence Livermore Lab to test new astronomical
telescope optics.

60 Starlink satellites were launched on May 26 to the usual 300 km, 53 degree orbit.

36 OneWeb satellites were launched on May 28 on a Soyuz from Vostochniy.

Electron flight 20
------------------

Two BlackSky Global imaging satellites were lost in the failure of RocketLab's Electron mission 20.
Shortly after second stage ignition the stage shut down, tumbled out of control and the vehicle
did not reach orbit. Apogee was 136 km.

SBIRS 
-----

The SBIRS GEO-5 satellite was launched on May 18. SBIRS GEO-5 uses an infrared telescope to detect
missile launches. Two 12U cubesats for the Air Force Academy were also carried and released
to a 180 x 4520 km x 26.2 deg orbit. The Centaur then restarted to put SBIRS in
an 897 x 35744 km x 21.2 deg geotransfer orbit. By Jun 1
SBIRS GEO-5 had raised its orbit to 25960 x 35734 km x 9.1 deg.

HY-2D
-----

On May 19 China's SAST launched a Chang Zheng 4B with the HY-2D (Hai Yang 2D) oceanographic
satellite.

Tianzhou-2
-----------

China's CALT launched a CZ-7 from Wenchang on May 29 carrying the
Tianzhou-2 cargo ship. Tianzhou-2 made a rapid rendezvous with Tianhe
and docked with it at 2101 UTC, 8 hr 6 min after launch. The CZ-7 second
stage, with a mass around 6 tonnes, was left in a 196 x 321 km x 41.5
deg orbit.

FY4-02
------

The Fengyun 4 satellite 02 (also called FY4B) meteorological satellite was launched to
geotransfer orbit on Jun 2.

ION-SVC
--------

The D-Orbit ION-SVC PULSE spacecraft released its final passengers, twelve 0.25U SpaceBEEs for Swarm
Technologies, on May 11.

Table of Recent Suborbital Launches
-----------------------------------

The Missile Defense Agency's FTM-31 Event 1 test on May 29 or May 30
appears to have involved launch of an MRBM-T3c2 target rocket with a
Trident C-4 first stage and M57 second stage, from Meck Island at
Kwajalein towards the central Pacific near Hawaii. The planned intercept
by two SM-6 missiles launched from an Aegis ship near Hawaii did not
take place, but it's not clear if the SM-6 missiles were launched but
missed, or weren't launched at all.

Further missile defense tests were carried on in late May from South
Uist in the Hebrides, with Aegis intercepts by ships off the west coast
of Scotland.

International Space Station
---------------------------

Expedition 65 continues.

On Jun 30 the Canadarm-2 removed the IROSA FSE carrier from the POA (Payload ORU Accomodation)
storage point on the ISS truss Mobile Base System and stowed it in the trunk of Dragon CRS-22,
wrapping up the operations to install the 2B and 4B IROSA solar arrays.

Cygnus NG-15, in free flight after departing ISS, released three cubesats from its SEOPS LLC Slingshot
deployer on Jun 30. Two of the satellites are thought to be ORCA-7 and Gunsmoke-J 3.
NG-15 was deorbited over the Pacific at about 0130 UTC Jul 2.

According to reporting by Novosti, the BD-28 satellite deployed from ISS
on Jun 22 is actually G-SATELLITE 2. The satellite is owned by OneTeam,
a collaboration of Tokyo U's Nakasuka Funase Lab and various companies.
G-SATELLITE 1 was deployed in similar secrecy in Apr 2020.  That
satellite's mission was advertising, to promote the Tokyo Olympics.  It
contained mechanisms to deploy to the exterior (but remaining attached)
a display with figurines of robot characters from the 'Mobile Suit
Gundam' anime television series, and a camera to image them against the
Earth in the background. I assume G-SATELLITE 2 is a duplicate of the
first one.

On Jul 8 at 1445 UTC the Dragon CRS-22 cargo ship undocked from the IDA-3 docking port
to begin its return to Earth. Around 1800 UTC Jul 8 the ship lowered its orbit to 203 x 319
km. On Jul 10, after jettisoning the trunk (containing the IROSA FSE) CRS-22 fired
its engines at about 0245 UTC for a 9 minute deorbit burn, and splashed down at 0329 UTC
in the Gulf of Mexico near 84.3W 29.2N.

On Jul 21 at 1045 UTC astronauts Kimbrough, McArthur, Hoshide and Pesquet undocked
from IDA-2 in Dragon Endeavour and flew around ISS to redock at IDA-3 at 1135 UTC.
This leaves IDA-2 free for the planned Starliner docking.

On Jul 21 at 1458 UTC Roskosmos launched a Proton-M from Baykonur
carrying the 20-tonne MLM-U Nauka module to orbit. Nauka is scheduled to
dock with the ISS Zvezda nadir port. Attached to the 19627 kg Nauka is
the European Robotic Arm, ERA, a 630 kg, 11.4m long robot arm. Two parts
of Nauka, the ShK airlock and the module radiator, are already at ISS -
they have been sitting dormant attached to the Rassvet module for the
past eleven years. On the first day in orbit, a number of Nauka's
systems malfunctioned, including its main engines, and flight
controllers were working to resolve the issues.

Blue Origin NS-16
-----------------

On Jul 20 Blue Origin launched the New Shepard PM4/CC2.0-2 stack on its
third flight from the West Texas launch site. Mission NS-16 carried Jeff
Bezos, Mark Bezos, Wally Funk and Oliver Daemen aboard the crew capsule
CC2.0-2 (RSS First Step). The flight reached a 107 km apogee; the booster
PM4 landed back at the launch site and the capsule separated and landed
on parachutes.

Virgin Galactic Unity-22
------------------------

Virgin Galactic carried out another test flight of Spaceship Two into
space on Jul 11, with six Virgin Galactic employees on board: Chief
Pilot David Mackay, Pilot Mike Masucci, and 'Astronaut 001' to
'Astronaut 004' Richard Branson, Beth Moses, Colin Bennett and Sirisha
Bandla.

The Unity 22 mission took off from Spaceport America at 1443 UTC. The
carrier plane VMS Eve, flying at 14.1 km altitude, dropped the VSS Unity
spaceplane at 1525 UTC over 107.0W 33.2N. Two seconds later Unity fired
its hybrid rocket engine for a 60 second burn with a cutoff velocity of
0.98 km/s. Unity reached space at D+2:02 (2 min 2s after drop); at
D+2:39 it reached an apogee of 86.2 km above sea level. It dropped below
80 km at D+3:14 and glided to landing back at Spaceport America at
D+14:19 (touchdown), with wheels stop at D+15:14. The exact drop time to
the second is not yet available.

Virgin Orbit
------------

Virgin Orbit's third orbital attempt, with LauncherOne S/N R4, was
carried out on Jun 30. The Boeing 747 'Cosmic Girl' took off from Mojave
at 1353 UTC and flew to 120.1W 33.2N where it dropped the LauncherOne at
1447 UTC. The first stage ignited a few seconds later. The two-stage
rocket reached transfer orbit at 1455 UTC and then made an orbit
circularization burn at 1525 UTC. Payload deployment began at 1527 UTC.

The payloads were:
   CNCE Block 1 (two 3U satellites) for the Missile Defense Agency's Cubesat Networked Communications Experiment
    - the two cubesats will mimic two suborbital interceptor kill vehicles and test communications between them.
    Control from MDA/Schriever in Colorado Springs; unclear who built the satellites.
   
   Gunsmoke-J, a 3U communications test satellite for the US Army Space and Missile Defence Center, built by
     TriSept Corp. Two other Gunsmoke-J satellites were launched on Electron 19 and Cygnus NG-15.

   Halo-NET Free Flyer, a 3U test of a laser retroreflector array for the US Navy's Space and Naval Warfare Center's
    laser communications program. An earlier Halo-NET payload flew attached to STPSAT-5 in 2018.

   Brik-II, a 6U test satellite for the Royal Netherlands Air Force.

   STORK 4 and STORK 5, 3U imaging satellites for SatRevolution of Poland.
   


Transporter-2
-------------

SpaceX launched the Transporter-2 rideshare mission and three Starlink satellites on Jun 30.
The main payload was a stack of 4 ESPA rings from which satellites were ejected. The three
Starlink satellites were on a truss structure at the top of the stack and ejected last. It is not yet clear if
the usual four tension rods were also released. Three of the ejected payloads - Sherpa-FX2, Sherpa-LTE1
and ION-SVC-003 - were `tugs' that carried satellite stacks of their own. The Sherpa subsatellites
were released within a few hours of launch. Two NASA satellites were released from a Mandrake dispenser
attached to the aft end of the second stage. The second stage was deorbited over the Indian Ocean
at about 2130 UTC, with the ESPA stack still attached. (On Transporter 1, the Starlinks were between
the ESPA stack and the second stage, so the ESPA stack had to be itself ejected and remains in orbit as debris.)

ION-SVC-003 'Dauntless David' began dispensing its payloads on Jul 16, including the first Kuwaiti satellite
QMR-KWT.


OneWeb
------

36 more OneWeb satellites were launched by Soyuz from Vostochniy on Jul 1.

CZ-2D
-----

SAST (Shanghai) launched a CZ-2D from Taiyuan on Jul 3 with five imaging
satellites. The Jilin-1 series of commercial Earth imaging satellites is
operated by the Changguang Sat Tech Ltd in Changchun, Jilin province.
The Jilin-1 Kuanfu (wide) series has a large field of view while the
Jilin-1 Gaofen (hi-res) series has narrow hi-res imagers. Xingshidai-10
(also called Guangdong Hengjian) is a small imaging satellite from
Guoxing Yuhang Keji YG (ADA Space).

Jilin-1 Kuanfu 01B is also called Neimenggu 1 (Inner Mongolia 1).


Tianhe
------

Chinese astronauts Liu and Tang made the first spacewalk from the new Chinese station on Jul 4.
The hatch was opened at 0011 UTC and closed at 0657 UTC. They installed foot restraints on
the robot arm and tested moving Liu on the arm, and deployed an exterior camera.

CZ-4C
-----

SAST (Shanghai) launched a CZ-4C from Jiuquan on Jul 4 with the Fengyun 3E polar weather 
satellite. The satellite entered a sun-sync orbit with 0541 local time descending node.

CZ-3C
-----

CALT (Beijing) launched a CZ-3C from Xichang on Jul 6 with the TianLian 1-05 data relay satellite.


CZ-6
----

SAST launched a CZ-6 from Taiyuan on Jul 9 with five radio-spectrum monitoring satellites for the Ningxia
company, designated Zhongzi Constellation Group 2.


CZ-2C
-----

CALT launched a CZ-2C from Xichang on Jul 19 with the tenth triplet of Yaogan-30 satellites,
thought to be for signals intelligence. The Tianqi-15 commercial communications satellite
was carried as a secondary payload.

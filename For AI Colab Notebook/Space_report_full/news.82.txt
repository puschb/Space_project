Jul 30 1991 (no.82)
----------------------------------------------------

Launch of STS-43/Atlantis is scheduled for August 1.  Meanwhile,
Endeavour has been moved into the orbiter processing facility to begin
preparations for its first mission set for next year. 

Anatoliy Artsebarksiy and Sergey Krikalyov continue in orbit aboard the
Mir/Kvant/Kvant-2/Kristall/Soyuz TM-12/Progress M-8 complex.  More
spacewalks are planned soon. The new schedule is:

Soyuz TM-13 launch in October, crew up:
Commander:            Aleksandr Volkov (Soviet Air Force)
Cosmonaut-researcher: Tokhtar Aybarkirov (Republic of Kazakhstan)
Cosmonaut-researcher: Franz Viehbock (Republik Osterreich [Austria])
Crew down: Artsebarskiy, Aybarkirov, Viehbock.

Soyuz TM-14 launch in Mar 1992: crew up, Aleksandr Viktorenko 
plus flight engineer from NPO Energiya plus German researcher;
crew down, Volkov, Krikalyov and the German.

I'm not sure about the spelling of Aybarkirov's name.  This will be the
first time that two passengers have flown on a single Soyuz; normally
it's two pro cosmonauts and one passenger.  However, a number of
cosmonauts have trained to fly Soyuz single-handed in case they have to
fly an emergency rescue mission to Mir to bring a sick crew home, so it
is something they have the capability to do. 

Another Resurs-F remote sensing satellite was launched on Jul 23.
It replaces the 11th Resurs-F which landed on Jul 21 in Kazakhstan.
The Resurs-F satellites are based on the old Vostok spaceship bus.

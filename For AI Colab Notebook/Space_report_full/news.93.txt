Jonathan's Space Report

31 Oct 1991 (no.93)
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Galileo probe passed less than 1600 km from minor planet (951)
Gaspra at 2237 UT on 1991 Oct 29.  Data from the encounter will be
stored on board and returned to Earth in late 1992. 

Atlantis was moved to pad LC39A on Oct 24.  The STS-44 mission will be a
military one; the Defense Support Program early warning satellite will
be deployed on an IUS upper stage, and US Army payload specialist Tom
Hennen will participate in the Terra Scout and M88-1 experiments to see
what a trained imagery analyst can see from orbit.  [Question to my
readers: can anyone who knows about military stuff explain to an
ignorant civilian what a Chief Warrant Officer 3 is and how it relates
to the ranks other military astronauts have like Major, Captain, etc?]

The Mir/Kvant/Sofora/Kvant-2/Kristall/Soyuz TM-13/Progress M-10 complex
continues in orbit with crew Aleksandr Volkov and Sergey Krikalyov.  
The robot cargo ship Progress M-10 docked with Mir on Oct 21. This is
a longer interval than normal between launch and docking and may indicate
continuing problems with the rendezvous antenna.

According to the weekly listing issued by NASA-Goddard, satellite 21225,
the Compton Observatory (GRO), reentered on Oct 12.  However, the folks
down the hall assure me they're still getting data from it, so we can
safely assume the report is a typo.  Remember, never believe anything
you read, even from an official source. 

Meanwhile, the USAF/NASA Combined Release and Radiation Effects
Satellite, CRRES, has apparently failed in orbit.  The chemical release
part of the mission was complete but more data on the space radiation
environment had been hoped for. 

The Foton materials processing spacecraft landed in Kazakhstan
on Oct 20 after 16 days in orbit.

A geostationary satellite was launched by Proton from Baykonur on Oct
23.  Soviet geostationary satellite programs include Raduga (government
communications), Gorizont (TV relay), and various classified Kosmos
programs.  I don't know which this one is yet.

Jonathan's Space Report

Atlantis has returned to KSC to be prepared for Spacelab mission STS-45.
Discovery is now in the VAB being mated to the tank for mission STS-42.
This mission will carry the International Microgravity Lab into orbit.

Congratulations to General Dynamics on the successful launch of the
first Atlas II at 2247 UT on Dec 7 from Launch Complex 36A at Cape
Canaveral.  The Atlas II 8102/Centaur II AC-102 vehicle successfully
placed the European EUTELSAT II F-3 satellite in a 17 degree inclination
transfer orbit.  The first burn of the on-board German built S400 apogee
engine placed the satellite in a 5 degree intermediate orbit; a few more
burns are needed to place it in geostationary orbit. 

GD also carried out a successful launch together with USAF Space Command
of the refurbished Atlas 53E booster at 1323UT on Nov 28 from
Vandenberg.  This was the 500th Atlas launch since the first attempt in
1957.  Payload for the Atlas was the USAF weather satellite DMSP Block
5D-2 F-11, with an integrated Star 37S solid upper stage used to place
the satellite in polar orbit. 

The Mir/Kvant/Sofora/Kvant-2/Kristall/Soyuz TM-13/Progress M-10 complex
continues in orbit with crew Aleksandr Volkov and Sergey Krikalyov.  

I goofed on 1991-79A; it is actually a Russian geostationary satellite,
Kosmos-2172. I don't know why no data on it was released initially.
It was launched around 1300UT on Nov 22 from Kosmodrom Baykonur by
a Proton launch vehicle. The third stage of the UR-500K stack placed
the payload and fourth stage in a 191x204 km orbit inclined 51.6 deg
to the equator. After less than one orbit the Blok-DM fourth stage ignited
and placed the combination in a 200x36300 km transfer orbit inclined 47 degrees.
At apogee the fourth stage ignited for a second time to circularise the
orbit and separated from the payload into a supersynchronous 36219x36292 km
orbit inclined 1.4 degrees and drifting at 6 degrees per day in longitude.
By Dec 12 the payload was drifting in near-stationary orbit (35546x35981 km)
at 0.3 deg per day across the Atlantic, at 16 degrees West longitude, approaching
its operational station.

1991-81A, the navigation satellite, is Kosmos-2173 rather
than Kosmos-2172 as erroneously stated last time.

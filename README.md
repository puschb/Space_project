## Satelite Data Visualization

This project visualizes satelite data from the gcat and satcat datasets using the Java library Processing. It allows users to query data using visual aids such as bar charts, dot plots, pie charts, and a 3d rendering of real time orbits (as of April 2022). The project also allows users to access a question-answer language model that has been indexed on Jonathan's Space Report, which contains comprehensive information of all space launches in the last few decades. This model is implemented using Ktrain's SimpleQA class and can be used to query the report.

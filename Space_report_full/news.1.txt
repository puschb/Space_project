Space Report No. 1, Jan 30, 1989


The Mir space station raised its orbit last week to counteract the
effects of drag caused by high density in the upper atmosphere.
Every 11 years as solar activity increases, the Earth's outer atmosphere 
becomes denser and low orbit satellites burn up. Three cosmonauts 
are working aboard the Mir station, which is the first permanently
occupied space laborartory. Next week marks two years of continuous human
presence in space.

Space Shuttle Discovery was moved to the Vehicle Assembly Building
last week for mating to its booster rockets. It will be moved to 
the launch pad next week and is likely to fly at the beginning of March.
This STS-29 mission is to launch a tracking and data relay satellite
which is needed to relay data from the Space Telescope (due next year).

The Soviet space probe Phobos-2 entered orbit around Mars on Jan 29. It is the first
Soviet Mars probe for 15 years. It will approach the Martian moon Phobos
in March or April.

A European Ariane rocket successfully launched an Intelsat communications satellite
last week. The satellite provides transatlantic telephone and television service and is 
owned by an international consortium.

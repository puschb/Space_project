Jonathan's Space Report

No. 107      1992 Mar 25
I'm starting to do an email distribitution of this report. If you'd
like to be on the list, please let me know.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Flight readiness firing (FRF) of Endeavour
on pad 39B is due on April 6 prior to preparations for mission STS-49.

The Hughes Communications cable TV relay satellite Galaxy V
was launched by Atlas I Centaur AC-72 at 0000 UTC on Mar 14 from Canaveral.
The satellite uses an HS-376 class bus.

A Nadezhda class navigation satellite, Kosmos-2181, was launched
from Plesetsk on Mar 9 around 2230UT. It has been placed in the
same orbital plane as Nadezhda(1). 

The launch of Optus Communications' Aussat B1 satellite
on a Chinese Chang Zheng 2E launch vehicle has been postponed.
A launch attempt last week was scrubbed when the first stage
automatically shut down during ignition. The rocket did not
leave the launch pad; it's what in Shuttle lingo would be called
an RSLS abort, like the first time they tried to launch Discovery
in 1984. (I only mention this because some of the press coverage
talks about a 'launch failure', which in my book means a launch
that occurs and fails, not one that fails to occur).

Orbiter 104 Atlantis is in Earth orbit following launch from pad 39A at
KSC at 1313.39UTC on Mar 24. The STS-45 main payload consists of the Atlas-1
Spacelab mission. This is the mission that used to be known as EOM-1,
and was scheduled for mission 61-K prior to the Challenger accident; it
is the last of the delayed fiscal 1986 missions to fly, six years late.
Below is a table of the 61- and 62- series of missions as on the
manifest in Jan 1986 (61-D, which was cancelled in 1985, eventually
was ressurrected and flew as STS-40/SLS-1 in 1991).

Mission		Payload			Actual Mission
61-D		Spacelab 4		-> STS 40, 1991
61-E		Astro-1			-> STS 35, 1990
61-F		Ulysses			-> STS 41, 1990
61-G		Galileo			-> STS 34, 1989
61-H		Westar, Palapa,Skynet	Cancelled [Payloads to Delta 182, 1987;
					 Comm.Titan 1, 1990; and Ariane V39, 1990]
61-I		Insat, LDEF-1R		-> STS 32R, 1990 [Insat to Ariane V24,1988]
61-J		HST			-> STS 31R, 1990
61-K		Spacelab EOM1/2		-> STS 45, 1992
61-L		Gstar 3/Syncom 5	Cancelled, payloads to Ariane V25, 1987 and STS 32R, 1990
61-M		TDRS-IUS/PAM		-> STS 29R, 1989
61-N		DoD			-> STS 33R, 1989 (?)
62-A		Teal Ruby/Cirris	-> STS 39, 1991 [Teal Ruby cancelled]
62-B		DoD			-> STS 27R, 1988

The Progress M-11 cargo ship undocked from Mir's front port on Mar 13
and was deorbited over the Pacific the same day. Mir crew Aleksandr 
Volkov and Sergey Krikalyov undocked from the Kvant rear port on Mar 14
in Soyuz TM-13 and redocked about an hour later at the Mir front port.
On Mar 17 at 0854 UTC a Soyuz launch vehicle left Baykonur carrying  NPO
Energiya's Soyuz TM-14 spaceship into orbit. Crew are Aleksandr
Viktorenko and Aleksandr Kaleri of Russia and Klaus-Dietrich Flade of
Germany. They docked at the Kvant rear port at 1233 UTC on Mar 19.
On Mar 25, Volkov, Krikalyov and Flade undocked from the front port
in Soyuz TM-13 and landed in Kazakhstan at 0851 UTC on Mar 25. This
leaves Viktorenko and Kaleri aboard the Mir/Kvant/Kvant-2/Kristall/Soyuz TM-14
complex. Krikalyov's flight was the third longest ever, at 311 days 20 hours
1 min, and he and Volkov hold second and fourth place in the cumulative
spaceflight experience rankings (Musa Manarov has 541 days,
Krikalyov has 463 days, Yuri Romanenko has 430 days, and Volkov has 391 days).

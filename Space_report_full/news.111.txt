BOOK REVIEWS: 
 
 Space Shuttle Almanac, by Joel Powell and Lee Caldwell. 262 pages. 
 $29.95 US  [+$10 overseas airmail] from Microgravity Press, 
 2351 Chicoutimi Dr. NW, Alberta Canada T2L OW2.
   This is unquestionably the best and most detailed source on the
 Shuttle available. It's very short on text, and has no pretty color
 pictures, but is packed with diagrams and information. For each
 mission up to STS-37, has details of the crew and payloads carried,
 diagrams of the payloads and of EVA operations, and all the numbers
 (serial numbers of engines, which robot arm was carried, what time
 orbital manuevers were carried out, etc, etc.). There are
 also diagrams of various parts of the orbiter, associated equipment,
 ground facilities, and maps of the KSC, Edwards, and White Sands
 landing sites. Finally, the inclusion of all the old launch schedule
 plans back to 1977 affords an amusing view of the way that the program
 has slipped.
  The book shows its somewhat 'home-published' nature in that a number
 of the diagrams are difficult to read, but I have no hesitation in
 recommending it to anyone who wants accurate and reliable information.
 The only mistakes I have found to date are the consistent misspelling
 of 'principal investigator'; the deploy time of TDRS 1, which
 is off by one day (p.231); an erroneous timeline for STS 61-B, and
 a reference to the nonexistent date Feb 29, 1990 (p.134).

 Cosmonautics 1991, by Y. Semenov et al. Matson Press. 68 pages.
 $25 US, from Aersopace Ambassadors, PO Box 12603, Huntsville AL 35815.
  This nicely produced book contains articles written about the
 Soviet space program by some of its senior members, including
 NPO Energiya director Semenov and former cosmonaut Ryumin. Notable
 articles include a review of 1991 activities in the Mir program,
 a historical overview of the DOS and Almaz (civilian and military
 Salyut) space station programs, and a brief summary of some of
 the already released information about the N-1 moon rocket.
 Unfortunately the book, like its 1990 predecessor, is spoilt by
 an apparent total lack of proofreading. The translation from Russian
 is rather poor, and filled with typos - KNES for the French space
 agency CNES; Timoty Meitss for the UK backup cosmonaut Timothy Mace,
 MARTA and MANTRA instead of MATRA (a French space firm) and so on.
 There are also factual errors (e.g. Kosmos-2122 is listed as being
 launched by a Soyuz launch vehicle, which is incorrect). However,
 there are some very nice color photos of the Mir station. An interesting
 contrast to the Powell book - pretty but superficial and unreliable.
 The Aerospace Ambassadors group is doing a lot of work on cooperation
 between the US and Russia in space, and I look forward to their forthcoming
 'Cosmonautics: The History'.

Space Shuttle mission STS-49, the maiden flight of orbiter Endeavour, is
still planned for early May.

Another USAF Navstar Global Positioning Satellite was launched at 0320
UTC on 10 Apr. Launch of Navstar 28 was by McDonnell Douglas Delta 7925
from complex 17 at Cape Canaveral. This was the 22nd Delta 2 launch; all
have been successful. The Thor first stage flew a suborbital trajectory;
the Delta second stage placed the payload and third stage in a low earth
orbit inclined 21 degrees, then separated and used up its remaining fuel
moving into a 530x715 km orbit (Deltas used to have a habit of blowing
up several years after launch and littering low earth orbit with lots of
fragments; the fuel depletion burn seems to have cured this problem).
The PAM-D Star-48 third stage ignited to put the payload in a 200 x
20400 km transfer orbit inclined 35 degrees to the equator. At apogee,
the Navstar's internal Star-37F apogee motor fired to place the payload
in a circular 20000 km  semi-synchronous (12-hour) orbit at an
inclination of 55 degrees; the orbit will be adjusted slightly over the
next few weeks. The Block IIA Navstar satellites are built by Rockwell;
they contain atomic clocks which are used to provide accurate
positioning information for military and civilian uses.  The next GPS
launch will be Navstar 26 in August.

The first Ariane 4 with an upgraded H10-Plus third stage was launched on
Apr 15 from the Centre Spatiale Guyanais in Kourou, France at about 2312
UTC. This was an Ariane 44L model; there have now been 22 Ariane 4
launches, with one failure. The payloads were Telecom 2A and Inmarsat II
F-4.

INMARSAT, the International Maritime Satellite Organization,
operates communications satellites used by ships and aircraft.
These use the L-band around 1.5 GHz rather than the C (6/4GHz) and
Ku (12/11 GHz) used by most communications satellites. Inmarsat
started off using satellites leased from other organizations
(the Comsat Corp. MARISAT and the ESA MARECS) and transponders
on INTELSAT satellites but now has its own INMARSAT II network
(INMARSAT I was considered to be the leased network). The satellites
are built by a Matra Marconi Space/British Aerospace collaboration
and are based on the Eurostar 1000 bus which uses a liquid
propellant apogee motor. 

INMARSAT II satellites

Satellite		Launch		Orbit

Inmarsat II F-1		1990 Oct 30	GEO Indian Ocean
Inmarsat II F-2		1991 Mar  9	GEO Atlantic Ocean
Inmarsat II F-3		1991 Dec 16	GEO Pacific Ocean
Inmarsat II F-4		1992 Apr 15	Due over Atlantic

The Telecom satellites are owned by France Telecom which
operates them in conjuction with the French space agency 
CNES. Based on Matra Marconi Space's Eurostar 2000 bus
which uses a Marquardt R4D liquid apogee motor, the
satellites provide 10 C-band transponders for communicatons
between mainland France and its overseas parts 
(departements et territoires d'outremer), 11 Ku-band
transponders for business communications links, and
5 X-band transponders for the Syracuse system, a military
communications network operated by the DGA (Delegation
Generale de l'Armament). 

France Telecom satellites

Satellite	Launch

Telecom 1A	1984 Aug  4
Telecom 1B	1985 May  8
Telecom 1C	1988 Mar 11
Telecom 2A	1991 Dec 16
Telecom 2B	1992 Apr 15				
Telecom 2C	1993?

The Synthetic Aperture Radar antenna on the Japanese Fuyo-1 satellite
has been successfully deployed. The antenna initially failed to
deploy after launch in February.

The Kosmos-2107 ocean surveillance satellite reentered on Apr 5. It was
launched in Dec 1990 and operated in a 404x418 km orbit at 65 deg
inclination until about Mar 10 this year, when its on board engine was
used to deboost it to a 226x400 km orbit from which it rapidly decayed.

Jonathan's Birthday Space Report :-)

Shuttle Mission STS-50
------------------------

Columbia  broke the Shuttle duration record at 1349 UTC today when it
passed the  10 d 21 h mark. That previous record was also set  by
Columbia, on the STS-32R mission in 1990. Columbia is due to land on Jul
8 at Edwards AFB. Columbia has also recaptured the record for total
Orbiter flight hours from Discovery; it has flown over 2060 hours in 12
missions, compared with 2005 hours by Discovery in 14 missions. Payload
Commander Dr. Bonnie Dunbar is now the active US astronaut with the most
flight hours, the first time a woman has held this record  (Chief
astronaut Dan Brandenstein has more flight hours and is still
technically active, but since he has announced he will retire in October
he will not be assigned to any more flights, so I've scratched him from
my list already.)  Dunbar also has gained the women's world cumulative
duration record, previously held by Kathy Sullivan.

Aleksandr Viktorenko and Aleksandr Kaleri continue their mission
aboard the Mir complex; they have become the 23rd crew to pass
the 100-day mark. The longest US flight ever was 84 days.

Launches
--------

The SAMPEX (Solar and Magnetospheric Particle Explorer) satellite was
launched on Jul 3 at 1417 UTC by Scout S215C from Space Launch Complex 5 at
Vandenberg AFB in California. The satellite is NASA's first Small
Explorer, an attempt to return to the days when science satellite
projects were completed in only a few years with limited budgets. The
150 kg satellite carries four experiments to study cosmic rays, the
particle composition of solar flares, and precipitating electrons in the
magnetosphere.

Kosmos-2195 was launched on Jul 1.

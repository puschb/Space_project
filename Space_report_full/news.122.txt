Jonathan's Space Report 

No. 122		1992 Jul 13

I'll be in the real Cambridge for the next few weeks; normal service
will resume in early August.

Shuttle Mission STS-50
------------------------

Orbiter OV-102 Columbia landed on Runway 33 at Kennedy Space Center
at 1142:25 UTC Jul 9 (main gear touchdown) after a one day delay due
to bad weather at Edwards. Mission duration was 13 days 19 h 30 m 4 sec,
the longest Shuttle flight yet. Columbia now has 2132 flight hours
in 12 missions, more than any of the other orbiters. The mission beat
Gemini 7's duration by 55 minutes, making it the longest US spaceflight
with the exception of the three Skylab missions, although it is
still very short by Salyut/Mir standards. Bonnie Dunbar now has
761 h 15 min in 3 flights, more than any US astronaut except
Brandenstein, Young, and the Skylab astronauts.


Erratum: The Shuttle record was broken at 1312 UTC Jul 6 not 1349 UTC as I
mysteriously reported last week. Some day I'll learn to do arithmetic right :-)

After nearly 10 years, the concept of a reusable Spacelab is taking  on
more substance. Spacelab Long Module unit 1, the pressurized lab used
for the USML-1 flight, has now made 4 flights in space. Unit 2, which
will be used for the SL-J flight later this year, has made only 2
flights. Spacelab unpressurized pallets have been used on 8 flights,
but I have been unable so far to trace their re-use history (Any help
gratefully appreciated).

Giotto 
------

The European Space Agency probe Giotto encountered comet
P/Grigg-Skjellerup on 1992 Jul 10 at 1530 UTC. Its trajectory was expected
to pass 200 km from the nucleus. Giotto flew past P/Halley in
1986; during that encounter its camera was destroyed, but
its particles and fields experiments are still working.


Mir
---

Progress M-13 docked with the front port of Mir at 1655 UTC on Jul 4. An initial
attempt on Jul 2 was a failure. It will remain docked to Mir for only
a few weeks; on Jul 26 the Soyuz TM-15 will be launched with a replacement
crew and will use the docking port now occupied by the Progress.

Launches
--------

General Dynamics' Atlas II Centaur flight AC-103 was launched on Jul 2 around 2200 UTC from
Launch Complex 36A at Cape Canaveral. It carried the 6th DSCS III communications
satellite together with an IABS apogee stage; the DSCS III is built by GE Astro Space,
and owned by the Defense Communications Agency. DSCS stands for Defense Satellite
Communications System.

Rockwell Navstar GPS satellite 26 was launched at 0920 UTC on Jul 7 by Delta 211 ( a 7925 model)
from Launch Complex 17B at Cape Canaveral. I don't know the serial number
of the GPS that was axed by the anti-nuclear activists, does anyone?

Kosmos-2195 was launched on Jul 1 around 2010 UTC. It is a naval navigation satellite built by
NPO Prikladnoi Mekhaniki of Krasnoyarsk, Russia and launched by a Kosmos
R-14 booster built by NPO Yuzhnoye of Ukraine. Launch site was Plesetsk,
Russia. Kosmos-2195 entered the same plane as Kosmos-2135, launched in Feb 1991.
There are 6 orbital planes in the SNG navy navsat system, and another 4 in the
parallel civilian Tsikada system. Most recent launches to each plane are as follows:

PLANE	Sat		Launch Date	Orbit		System
					(km x km x deg)

0	Kosmos-2195	1992 Jul  1	958x1010x83	D76/ Navy
30	Kosmos-2184	1992 Apr 15	965x1016x83	D75/ Navy
60	Kosmos-2154	1991 Aug 22	970x1009x83	D72/ Navy
90	Kosmos-2172	1991 Nov 27	946x1019x83	D73/ Navy
120	Kosmos-2142	1991 Apr 16	961x1020x83	D71/ Navy
150	Kosmos-2180	1992 Feb 17	961x1015x83	D74/ Navy
195	Kosmos-2181	1992 Mar  9	971x1014x83	E23/ Tsikada
240	Nadezhda (3)	1991 Mar 12	955x1019x83	E22/ Tsikada-KOSPAS
285	Kosmos-2123	1991 Feb  5	964x1006x83	E21/ Tsikada-RS12,RS13
330	Nadezhda (2)	1990 Feb 27	953x1021x83	E20/ Tsikada-KOSPAS

A satellite launched at 1000 UTC on Jul 8 from Plesetsk by a Molniya
launch vehicle is probably an early warning satellite to be called Kosmos-2196.

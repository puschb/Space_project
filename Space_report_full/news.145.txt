STS-55
------

The launch of Columbia on mission STS-55 has been delayed until March 14.

Mir
---

Soyuz TM-15 landed at 0358 UTC on Feb 1 (Thanks to Yoshiro Yamada for
coming up with the information!).  Soyuz TM-15's flight was an in-orbit
record for a Soyuz spaceship - 188 days 21 h 39 m. The TM-15 flight is
thus the longest ever spaceflight in which the crew went up and came
down in the same spaceship. There have been 6 longer missions aboard
Salyut-7 and Mir since 1982. The mission gives Anatoli Solov'yov
377 days in space over 3 missions, putting him in the top 5 for
cumulative flight hours.

The Progress M-15 flight was also a record duration for a Progress craft
- 103 days. Progress M-16 was launched on Feb 21 from Baykonur, it is an
automated cargo craft, to deliver fuel, air, water and supplies to the
Mir complex. It docked with Mir on Feb 23.

The Asuka spacecraft has successfully deployed its solar panels. The
next, and most critical, stage in its activation, expected as this issue
goes to press, is the extension of the deployable optical bench: Asuka
is the first truly *telescopic* telescope in space ( :-) ) and the
correct alignment of the mirrors is essential for mission success. Note
that the name Asuka is pronounced <As'ka> (the u is almost completely
swallowed). Because of confusion by English-speaking journalists over
the pronounciation, ISAS has invented a new name for use by Westerners,
ASCA (Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and Astrophysics). However, JSR
will continue to use the name Asuka which I consider to be more
'correct'. 

The Kosmos-2183 spy satellite was deorbited on Feb 16 after 314 days in
orbit. The 16th of this advanced series, Kosmos-2223, was launched in
December to replace it.

Kosmos-2225, 4th in a series of advanced mapping satellites, was deorbited
after 58 days on Feb 18. There may have been an explosion during
the deorbit burn, as several fragments appeared in eccentric orbits at
the time of the deorbit.

The classified signals intelligence satellite launched by Discovery in
December finally entered the NORAD catalog around Feb 18 (although its
orbital elements are still classified). It has been assigned the name
USA 89 and the catalog number 22518; there is also a final stage rocket
with number 22519. Cataloging of a final stage rocket 75-80 days after
launch parallels the behaviour of USA 40, launched from Columbia in Aug
1989, which stayed in a low orbit for 114 days before firing and
separating from its final stage rocket, probably moving to a highly
elliptical 12-hour orbit. The satellite may carry out a high resolution
survey of radio emitters (e.g. radars) in low orbit before moving to an
orbit from which it can carry long term monitoring.

Erratum: In the annual launch list, I included a bogus
orbit for the Topex/Poseidon spacecraft. The orbit should have
read:
52A	Topex/Poseidon            1331 x 1343 x 66.1
Thanks to Russell Eberst for pointing out this error and to
Richard Langley for passing on the launch time of Kosmos-2234.

I'll be travelling for a couple of weeks so JSR will probably not
appear for a while.

STS-55 and STS-56
-----------------

Analysis of the STS-55 launch pad abort is continuing. Contamination has
been found in the failed main engine check valve. STS-56 has jumped the
queue and is now due to launch on April 6 at 0532 UTC. STS-55 will
follow, in late April, and STS-57 will fly in late May. Now that STS-57
has been mated to its tank and boosters, there are three complete
Shuttle stacks at KSC.

New Russian Launch Vehicle
---------------------------

The first launch of the Start, a  converted RS-12M (NATO designation
SS-25) ICBM, was carried out from Plesetsk on Mar 25. It placed an test
satellite in orbit, carrying a comsat made by NPO Kompleks. The orbit is
683 x 970 km inclined 75.8 degrees, similar to the orbits used for test
launches of the Tsiklon rocket in 1977. The RS-12M was developed from 
the 1970's vintage RS-12 missile, known by NATO as SS-13. Both missiles
were developed by the Nadiradize design bureau. This is the first time
in many years that a Soviet military missile has been converted for
space use; previous cases were the Korolev R-7 (1957, became Vostok/Soyuz launcher),
the Yangel R-12 (1962, became original Kosmos launcher); the Yangel R-14
(1964, became current Kosmos launcher); and the Yangel R-36 (1966,
used for military space projects; civilian modification Tsiklon introduced
in 1977). The other Soviet launch vehicles (UR-500 Proton, N-1, Energiya, Zenit)
were developed directly for space use.

Atlas Failure
-------------

General Dynamics' Atlas-Centaur AC-74 was launched at 2138 UTC on Mar
25. The Atlas lost some power during the booster burn, and the Centaur
had to burn longer to make up and get into parking orbit. As a result,
the second Centaur burn to transfer orbit ran out of fuel during the
burn. The Hughes UHF Follow On (UFO) F1 satellite was left in a 219 x
9158 km x 27.3 deg orbit. The UFO F1 satellite is an HS-601 comsat built
by Hughes, and currently owned by Hughes. It was to be delivered
on-orbit to the US Navy to replace the Fltsatcom series of UHF
communications satellites, hence the name. This is the third failure of
the Atlas I class rocket in the last 4 launches; however, the Atlas II
class rocket has not had any failures.

Russian Launches
----------------

A geostationary satellite was launched by Proton from Baykonur on Mar
25. It hasn't reached its final position yet and I don't know what kind
of satellite it is (the name Gorizont in the table below is just a
guess). A signals intelligence satellite was launched by Zenit from
Baykonur on Mar 26. Again, I don't know the correct name yet, but the
orbit is one used by the latest generation of Kosmos electronic
listening satellites.

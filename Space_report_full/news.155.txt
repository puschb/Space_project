Shuttle
-------

The STS-57 launch is due on June 3. Endeavour's main payload is the 
Spacehab module. This is a commercial pressurized module belonging to
Spacehab, Inc. The pressurized module itself was built by Alena Spazio
of Italy. It's somewhat smaller than a Spacelab module and much less
fancy, and provides extra storage space for experiments and limited lab
facilities. On this mission there are about 20 main experiments for
materials processing, life sciences, and technology, including a test of
a water recycling system for the Space Station. Other payloads include
SHOOT, the Superfluid Helium On-Orbit Transfer, and a GAS Bridge
Assembly with ten getaway special canisters, also mostly with materials
processing and life sciences experiments. GAS can G-601 carries a
helioseismology experiment developed by the San Diego section of the
AIAA. SHOOT will carry liquid helium at a temperature of 1.1 K, and will
test ways of moving the cryogen from one dewar to another. Further
activities on the mission will be the rendezvous with and retrieval
of the EURECA (European Carrier) satellite, and the DTO1210 spacewalk
to practise for the Station assembly and the HST repair.

Crew for STS-57 are Col. Ronald Grabe (Commander), Col. Brian Duffy
(Pilot), David Low (Payload Commander), Capt. Nancy Sherlock (Mission
Specialist 2), Dr. Jeff Wisoff (Mission Specialist 3) and Dr. Janice
Voss (Mission Specialist 4). Low and Wisoff will make the spacewalk.


Mir
---

The Progress M-18 supply ship was launched from Baykonur on May 22. It
is to dock at the front port of the Mir complex. The Progress M, built
by NPO Energiya,  is a modified Soyuz ship without a crew, and carries
food, water, air and other supplies. This one also carries repair
equipment for a spacewalk device damaged last month. Cosmonauts
Manakov and Poleshchuk will make another spacewalk to carry out
the repair.


Launches
--------

A spacecraft was launched into a 82.6 degree inclination orbit 
from Plesetsk on May 21 by a Soyuz launch vehicle. The satellite
is probably a Resurs-F satellite built by KB Foton of Samara.
The Resurs-F is a modified version of the original Vostok spaceship,
carrying film cameras to image the Earth for civilian remote
sensing. The spacecraft will be recovered in a few weeks.

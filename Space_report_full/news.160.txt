Shuttle
-------

Endeavour landed on Jul 1 at Kennedy Space Center. Main gear touchdown
on runway 33 was at 1252:16 UTC for a flight time of 239 hours 44 min 54
sec or just less than 10 days. Endeavour was rolled to Orbiter
Processing Facility bay 1 for payload removal and preparation for its
next flight - the Hubble Space Telescope servicing mission.

Mir
---

The Soyuz TM-17 spaceship was launched from Baykonur at 1432 UTC on Jul
1, carrying two Russian astronauts (the EO-14 long-stay Mir crew)
and one French astronaut. The crew will carry out the French 'Altair'
research mission aboard Mir until Jul 22 when the French astronaut will
return to Earth with the EO-13 crew aboard Soyuz TM-16; the EO-14
crew will then begin their main mission, remaining aboard Mir until
they are relieved at the beginning of December.

Soyuz TM-17 has now docked with the Mir complex,  probably replacing
Progress M-17 at the rear Kvant port. (However, Space Command element
sets still showed  Progress M-17 docked to Mir on Jun 30). The complex
now has Soyuz TM-16 docked at the APAS-89 port on Kristall, Progress
M-18 docked at the prime Mir port, and Soyuz TM-17 at the rear Kvant
port. Crew are: EO-13 commander Col. Gennadiy Mikhailovich Manakov (Air
Force cosmonaut detachment); EO-13 flight engineer Aleksandr Fyodorovich
Poleshchuk (NPO Energiya); EO-14 commander  Lt.Col. Vasiliy Vasilevich
Tsibliev (Air Force cosmonaut detachment); EO-14 flight engineer
Aleksandr Aleksandrovich Serebrov (NPO Energiya); and Altair mission
cosmonaut-researcher Col. Jean-Pierre Haignere (Centre national
d'etudes spatiales, France). Serebrov is making his 4th spaceflight,
having flown aboard Soyuz T-7, Soyuz T-8, and Soyuz TM-8. Tsibliev
and Haignere are making their first flights.

There have been more spaceflights by French citizens than by
any other country except the (former) Soviet Union, the USA, and
Germany. The French spaceflights have been typically longer than
the German ones, so the total time in space by French citizens
will again surpass that by the Germans at 0632 UTC on Jul 15.

Spaceflights by German nationals:

of an acute accent over the following letter. I'll omit it in subsequent
uses of his name.]

I haven't tried to separate out the various Soviet nationalities as I am
confused about the citizenship and nationality (as opposed to birthplace) 
of the various former Soviet astronauts.

In addition, former citizens of Australia, Costa Rica, China, the Netherlands
and Vietnam have made flights as naturalized American citizens. (Challenge
for the enthusiastic: who were they?)

Launches
--------

Another Resurs-F satellite was launched on  Jun 25, replacing
the one which landed 5 days earlier. The Resurs-F satellites, built
by the Central Specialized Design Bureau in Samara, Russia, carry
out remote sensing photography for environmental and mapping research.

Another contact was made with the Alexis satellite on Jun 30,
raising hopes for recovering control of the spacecraft.

Erratum: I have corrected launch times in the table for the last couple
of launches in May.

Publication Review
------------------

WORLDWIDE SATELLITE LAUNCHES, by Phillip S. Clark.

I thought readers might be interested to know about this publication.
For thirty years the standard source of  satellite launch information
was the RAE Table of Earth Satellites, published by the British Royal
Aircraft Establishment. It included launch and reentry dates and orbital
heights and inclination for every payload and rocket stage launched
into orbit.

Funding cuts axed the RAE Tables last year, and Clark's WSL is
essentially a privately produced continuation of them, with the same
format of monthly issues which are then combined, corrected and reissued
at the end of the year in an annual volume. Clark is  one of the leading
researchers on the Chinese and former Soviet space programs, and his
expertise shows in the production of the first 6 issues of WSL; the data
seems to be at least as reliable as that which came from the RAE.  There
are even a large number of improvements; launch sites are included; 
more details are given on the missions of the payloads and the names of
the rocket stages and other objects associated with the launch; and more
details are given on newly cataloged fragments. However, estimates of
future orbital lifetime of the satellites are no longer included; this
was an important part of the RAE's own research. Also, Clark retains the
limited orbital information of the RAE tables (perigee, apogee, argument
of perigee, inclination and approximate epoch). The inclusion of the
ascending node and an accurate perigee passage time would allow proper
orbital calculations to be done, and it is a pity that he hasn't done
this. Another disappointment is the low quality of the presentation; in
this era of sophisticated desktop publishing, I had hoped for  something
more than the old-style printer output. Hopefully if Phillip makes some
more money out of this he'll be able to afford a proper computer. But
overall, I would say that the WSL is an excellent replacement for the
old RAE tables. [TRUTH IN ADVERTISING WARNING: I know Phillip
personally, so I'd like you to buy his stuff. But it is good. Honest!] 

The annual subscription for the WSL tables is US $100, available from
Phil at Molniya Space Consultancy, 30 Sonia Gardens, Heston,
Middlesex TW5 0LZ, England.

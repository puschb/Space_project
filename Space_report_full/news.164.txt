Shuttle 
------- 

Launch of STS-51 has been delayed until at least Aug 12 because
of the Perseids.   Payloads are the ACTS communications satellite and the
ORFEUS astronomy satellite. Meanwhile, the STS-58 stack is awaiting
the rollover of Columbia from the processing facility to the VAB;
stacking of solid rocket boosters for the STS-60 mission has
begun in the VAB; and preparation of Endeavour for the STS-61 mission
is continuing in the processing facility.

Mir
---

Tsibliev and Serebrov continue in orbit aboard the Mir complex.
Launch of the Progress M-19 cargo freighter was due on Aug 10.


Obituary: Milton Thompson (1926-1993)
--------

NASA-Dryden Chief Engineer Milt Thompson died on Aug 6. Milton Orville
Thompson, born on 4 May 1926, was a NASA test pilot from 1956 (when it
was still NACA) until 1967. He trained as an astronaut in the (later
cancelled) military X-20 Dyna-Soar program from 1962 to 1963, and  made
14 flights in the X-15-1 and X-15-3 spaceplanes. He also was a leading
force in the early days of the lifting body program, and was the first
pilot of the original M2-F1 lifting body demonstrator and the
rocket-powered M2-F2. 

Milt Thompson is the person who  came closest to flying in space without
actually doing so: he is the only person ever to have flown into the
mesosphere (above the stratopause at about 50 km) without making it
above the 80 km limit that is becoming the accepted boundary of space by
space historians. On May 25, 1965 he flew mission 1-54-88 aboard the
X-15-1 from Mud Lake, Nevada to Edwards AFB and reached 54.8 km apogee.
He made a second flight into the mesosphere on Aug 25, 1965 (mission
1-57-96) from Delamar Dry Lake, Nevada to Edwards, this time reaching
65.2 km. His fastest flight was in Jan 1965, when he reached almost 6000
km/hr (Mach 5.4) in the X-15-3. 


Launches
--------

NOAA-13 (formerly NOAA-I) was launched on Aug 8 from Space Launch
Complex 3 at Vandenberg by an Atlas E (probably serial number 34E, can
anyone confirm this?). The NOAA satellites are polar orbiting weather
satellites used by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
NOAA-13 is an Advanced TIROS-N model; the NOAA series is the
continuation of the original TIROS series of weather satellites started
by NASA in 1960. 

A Molniya-3 communications satellite was launched into highly
elliptical orbit with a 12 hour period on Aug 4 from Plesetsk. 

Few details of the Titan 4 failure have so far emerged. 
A correspondent reports that visual observations indicate
the second generation NOSS satellites consist of a pair
fixed about 50 km apart, with a third satellite between
them but moving from side to side, reaching distances of
over 100 km from the pair.

Shuttle Processing Explanation (or,  what are all these acronyms
anyway?):

 The Shuttle consists of an Orbiter (OV), an expendable External Tank
(ET), and a reusable pair of Redesigned Solid Rocket Motors (RSRM).  The
OV is prepared for flight in the Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF) which
consists of three bays (one of which is actually a separate building)
after which it is towed to the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) and
`mated to the stack' or joined to the ET and RSRM. First, the segments
of the RSRM are stacked up on a Mobile Launch Platform (ML) and then the
ET is connected to it. After the OV is mated, a Crawler-Transporter is
moved underneath the ML and carries the ML/RSRM/ET/OV stack to one of
the two pads (A or B) at launch complex 39 (LC39) where it is eventually
launched on a Space Transportation System (STS) mission. Occasionally
an OV is returned to the Rockwell International plant in Palmdale,
California for refit - an Orbiter Maintenance Down Period or OMDP.

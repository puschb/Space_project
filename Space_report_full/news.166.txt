Shuttle 
------- 

Discovery's main engines have now been changed. Columbia was moved to
the VAB on Aug 11 and mated to the external tank on Aug 13. Meanwhile,
the solids for STS-60 have been removed from the mobile launcher since
that mission has been delayed to next year. The Discovery STS-51
launch is now set for Sep 10 at 1138 UTC.

Mir
---

The Expedition 14 crew of Vasiliy Tsibliev and Aleksandr Serebrov 
continue in orbit aboard the Mir complex. Progress M-17 undocked
on Aug 11 at 1537 UTC from the Kvant rear port. Progress M-19
was launched on Aug 10 and 2224 UTC and docked at the Kvant
rear port at 0000 UTC on 13 Aug.

Other Missions
------------------

Mars Observer was due to enter orbit on Aug 24. At the time of writing
(about 1 hour before the MOI burn was due) there was still no contact
with the probe. Contact was lost on Aug 21 when the spacecraft was due
to pressurize its fuel tanks for the Mars Orbit Insertion burn. There is
a possibility that the MOI burn will execute correctly and that MO will
switch back to its low gain, omnidirectional antenna in a few days and
restore contact with Earth. But right now, things do not look very
encouraging, although NASA are maintaining that MO will likely get
into orbit OK.

Galileo is approaching encounter with minor planet (243) Ida. Flyby will
be on Aug 28 at 1622 UT. This is Galileo's second and last minor planet
encounter. (The first was with (951) Gaspra. Unfortunately there are no
plans for a flyby with the newly named (4589).)

The experimental reusable suborbital McDonnell Douglas DC-X rocket 
made its first test flight on Aug 19, to an altitude of about 50 m.
Takeoff and landing were at the White Sands Missile Range.

On Aug 21, the same day as the Mars Observer failure, the newly
launched NOAA-13 satellite stopped transmitting. NOAA-13
had been turned over to NOAA for checkout on Aug 12. It looks
like the solar arrays stopped talking to the batteries
and the satellite lost power.

The Hipparcos satellite was turned off this week; it stopped
returning science data in June. The satellite gathered data
for the best catalog yet of star positions and motions, which will
form a basic astronomical dataset for decades to come. The
catalog won't be ready for a few years. Hipparcos got off to
a rocky start in 1989 when an apogee motor failure left it
in transfer orbit, but heroic software rewrites allowed the mission
to get its data.

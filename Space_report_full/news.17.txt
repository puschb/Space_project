Jonathan's Space Report

May 24, 1989 (no. 17)


Delta II launch due for tonight if weather allows; Kosmos-2020 is up. 
The first launch of the Ariane 44L due soon.  Rather a quiet patch at
the moment, though. 

Have a nice long weekend; I'm forced to take it off as our system will
be down for upgrade.

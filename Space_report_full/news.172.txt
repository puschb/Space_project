Shuttle 
------- 

Columbia/STS-58 is due for launch on Oct 14. The payload is Spacelab
Life Sciences 2; the orbiter will carry the Extended Duration
Orbiter kit in the payload bay for the second time.
Crew are John Blaha (Commander), Richard Searfoss (Pilot),
Rhea Seddon, William McArthur, David Wolf, and Shannon Lucid
(Mission Specialists) and Martin Fettman (Payload Specialist)
plus 48 rats.

Mir
---

The Progress M-20 cargo spaceship was launched on Oct 11 from
Baykonur. It was due to link up with the Mir station on Oct 13.


Launches
--------

Another bad day for the US space program - the long awaited Landsat 6
remote sensing satellite is on the bottom of the Pacific. The Martin
Marietta Titan 23G launch vehicle lifted off successfully from  Space
Launch Complex 4-West at Vandenberg AFB at 1756 UTC on Oct 5; the two
stage launch vehicle delivered the payload to the planned suborbital
trajectory and separated at 1802 UTC an altitude of 724 km. The Thiokol
Star 37XFP apogee motor was meant to fire at 1810 UTC to place Landsat
in a circular orbit, but the burn was not monitored and there has been
no sign of Landsat since. (Thanks to Joel Runes for getting these
details for me). The apogee motor is considered to be part of the
payload, although earlier Landsats, which were all launched on Deltas,
didn't need one. The first Landsat was launched in 1972 and was then
called Earth Resources Technology Satellite 1. The first three Landsats
used the Nimbus weather satellite bus, while the last three have used
the Multimission Spacecraft (MMS) bus first used for Solar Max.

The Star 37 motor has a long and illustrious history, descending
from the retro-rockets used to land the Surveyor probes on
the Moon in the 1960s. The 37XF was used as an apogee motor
on Intelsat V, and the new 37XFP version was used successfully
on the Satcom K1 and K2, Astra 1A and ACTS satellites.

A recoverable satellite was launched from Jiuquan space
center in the Gobi desert on Oct 8. The Chinese FSW-1
(Fanhui Shi Weixing) satellite was placed in a 207 x 295 km
orbit inclined 57 degrees to the equator. 

The Galileo probe made a TCM (Trajectory Correction Maneuver) last week
(in five daily segments from Oct 4 to Oct 8). The reboost of the Compton
Observatory's orbit is proceeding; after the first two burns the orbit
had been raised from 337 km to 355 km; the original orbit was 452 km
high.

Reentries

Sep 28          Molniya-1 (1977-82A) reentered

Erratum
-------

The first KITSAT was renamed Uribyol 1 after launch. I haven't managed to 
confirm that the new one was also renamed, so I'm returning to the KITSAT
name in this week's listing.

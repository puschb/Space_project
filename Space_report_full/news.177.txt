Shuttle  
-------  

Endeavour was launched on mission STS-61 at 0927.00 on Dec 2.
Main engine cutoff came at 0935.31; the OMS-2 burn raised the orbit
to about 398 x 570 km at 1010 UT. Over the next few days
a series of rendezvous burns were carried out:
 NC1  Dec 2 1455    Phase adjust
 NSR  Dec 3 0811    Coelliptic burn
 NC2  Dec 3 0844    Phase adjust
 NH   Dec 4 0234    Height adjust
 NC3  Dec 4 0322    Phase adjust
 NPC  Dec 4 0403    Plane change
 NCC  Dec 4 0535    Corrective combination
 TI   Dec 4 0635    Terminal phase initiation
 MCC1 Dec 4 0715?   Mid course correction
 MCC2 Dec 4 0729    Mid course correction
 MCC3 Dec 4 0738    Mid course correction
 MCC4 Dec 4 0749.   Mid course correction

By 0755 on Dec 4 commander Covey took over manual control of Endeavour and
at 0847 Nicollier used the RMS arm to grapple the Hubble Space Telescope.

The spacecraft were now in a 585 x 592 km orbit inclined 28.5 degrees.
At 0922 HST was berthed onto the Flight Support System (FSS) last used
for the Solar Max repair. At 0935 the RMS was detached from HST and
by 1000 HST was on external power.

As of this writing 4 of the 5 planned spacewalks have been carried out.
EVA-1 on Dec 5 saw the replacement of the HST gyros and fuses. The
astronauts had problems closing the gyro shroud doors on HST, probably
due to thermal warping. On Dec 5 at 1325 the first solar panel was
retracted; the second one stuck because it was warped. On Dec 6 the
EVA-2 spacewalkers removed the dud solar panel; Kathy Thornton threw it
into space at 0451 on Dec 6; it received the catalog number 22920 and
designation 1990-37C. They then put the new solar panels on. The EVA
ended with a delayed repressurization when Thornton's ears had problems
re-adjusting to higher pressure. EVA-3, on Dec 7, saw the replacement of
WFPC-1 with WFPC-2 and the installation of two new magnetometers. One
of the magnetometer electronics boxes was discovered to be falling apart
and Hoffmann removed loose parts of it.
Next on EVA-4 came the removal of HSP and its replacement by COSTAR.
Also on this spacewalk Akers took over the MFR (Manipulator Foot Restraint
platform on the robot arm) from Thornton for an hour for the installation
of a new coprocessor for the HST on board computer.
        
       Start      End         Duration MFR/RMS   Free floater
EVA-1  Dec 5 0329 Dec 5 1138  08:00    Hoffmann  Musgrave
EVA-2  Dec 6 0325 Dec 6 1010  06:45    Thornton  Akers
EVA-3  Dec 7 0333 Dec 6 1024  06:51    Hoffmann  Musgrave
EVA-4  Dec 8 0305 Dec 8 1003  06:58    Thornton  Akers

Note: I measure durations from airlock depressurization to
repressurization; NASA's rule is a little different so they 
quote slightly shorter EVA times.

At the end of EVA 4, Tom Akers had 29 h 49 min of EVA time by my
count, making him the 6th ranked in all time spacewalk duration
after Russian cosmonauts Krikalyov (36h), Manarov (34h), Artsebarskiy
(32h), Kizim (31h) and V. Solov'yov (31h), and beating the US
record set by Conrad on Gemini, Apollo and Skylab flights.

Shuttle  
-------  

STS-61: The fifth and final spacewalk was carried out on Dec 9, with
depressurization at 0326 UT and repress at 1050 UT for a duration of 7h
24 m. During the EVA, Musgrave (on the robot arm) and Hoffmann
(free-floating) changed out the Solar Array Drive Electronics (SADE) and
manually deployed the solar array masts from the side of the  telescope.
They next repaired the Goddard High Resolution Spectrograph and added
covers to the magnetometers.  Finally, the astronauts removed the MFR
(Manipulator Foot Restraint) from the robot RMS arm. As the astronauts
were preparing to enter the airlock, the solar panels were unrolled from
the array masts.

The next day, at 0744 UT on Dec 10, the RMS arm grappled the Hubble
Space Telescope and at 0756 it was lifted off the Berthing and
Positioning System on the Flight Support Station in the cargo bay. At
0937 the HST aperture door was opened and at 1026.50 UT the arm released
HST into orbit again. Separation burns were carried out at 1027 and 1057
and the RMS arm was berthed.

The deorbit burn came at 0414 UT on Dec 13, with reentry at 0454 and
main gear touchdown on runway 33 at Kennedy Space Center  at 0525.33. 

The active NASA astronauts with the most flight hours are now:
Story Musgrave (858 hr in 5 flights), Shannon Lucid (838 hr in 4 flights),
Jeff Hoffmann (834 hr in 4), John Blaha (789 hr in 4), and Bonnie
Dunbar (761 hr in 3 flights). 

The next flight is STS-60, scheduled for launch on Feb 3. Discovery will
carry Spacehab 2 and the Wake Shield Facility, and will include Russian
cosmonaut Sergey Krikalyov on the crew.

Trivia
------

On Dec 11 at Sotheby's in New York a number of items from the Soviet
space program were auctioned. Ivan Ivanovich, the dummy launched
aboard a Vostok test flight, went for $170k; Sergey Korolev's slide
rule went for $21k; a few grains of moonrock went for $400k. Among
the more interesting items were the Merkur-TKS descent module from
the Kosmos-1443 military spaceship, and the film return capsule
from Salyut-5. Alas, everything turned out to be beyond the reach
of my credit card, but it was a fun trip anyway...

Launches
--------

The first Atlas Centaur IIAS, AC-108, with four Castor IVA strap on
solid boosters, was launched from Cape Canaveral on Dec 16.
This is the first time strap on solid rockets have been used on the Atlas,
although the technique has been used on Thor and Thor Delta vehicles
since 1963. The Thiokol Castor IVA rockets were used on Delta 6925 rockets
launched from 1989 to 1992; the current Delta 7925 uses GEM strapons
made by Hercules Aerospace. The Atlas IIAS is otherwise the same as the
Atlas IIA, and has the same Centaur IIA second stage.  All 7 Atlas II
series launches have been successful, despite recent problems with the
older Atlas I. 

The payload of AC-108 was AT&T Skynet Satellite Services' Telstar 401.
This satellite is the  first GE 7000 series satellite, built by Martin
Marietta Astro Space (formerly GE, formerly RCA...). The satellite
carries 24 C-band and 16 Ku-band communications transponders. AT&T
was the first commerical company to launch its own satellite,
the Telstar I satellite in 1962.

Shuttle  
-------  

Seven small satellites were deployed from Discovery's cargo bay on Feb
9. The ODERACS (Orbital DEbris RAdar Calibration System) satellites are
six tiny, passive aluminum spheres which will be used to calibrate
radars used to study space debris. ODERACS A and B are 10 cm spheres
(one rough, the other polished); C and D are 5 cm spheres, while
E and F are 15 cm spheres. The 63 kg BREMSAT satellite,
developed for the German space agency by the University of Bremen, will
measure  heat conductivity, micrometeorites, and the density of the
upper atmosphere.

Discovery made its deorbit burn at 1815 UTC on Feb 11 and
landed on runway 15 at KSC at 1919 UTC. Discovery has now made
18 flights, more than any other orbiter, although Columbia maintains
the record of the most flight hours, and should increase its lead on
its forthcoming flight.

 
Launches
--------

Another new launch vehicle made its debut this week - the Chang Zheng
(Long March) 3A. The CZ-3A is based on China's previous 
geostationary launch vehicle CZ-3, with an upgraded third stage.
The vehicle delivered a dummy model of a communications satellite
to geostationary transfer orbit; it also carried a scientific satellite
called Shi Jian 4. As of Feb 15 the objects had not been tracked in the West
so the launch must be considered unconfirmed at the moment.

Russia launched another Raduga-1 comsat on Feb 5. The Raduga-1 series
are improved versions of the Raduga ("Rainbow") government communications
satellites in use since 1975. The satellite will be placed at 49 deg East
in the geostationary ring.

The launch of a Galaxy communications satellite on a Delta 7925 from
Cape Canaveral was aborted on Feb 9 during main engine ignition. The
vehicle did not leave the pad and the payload is intact. No new launch
date has been set.

The Japanese OREX reentry test spacecraft has been renamed 'Ryusei' (meteor).
It splashed down in the Pacific but was allowed to sink; no recovery of
the vehicle was planned, as all the experimental data was telemetered back.

Errata:

 The VEP satellite's on-orbit name is transliterated Myojo, not Myouzyou.
 The Feb 5 launch was a Raduga-1, not a Kosmos.

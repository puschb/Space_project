Shuttle  
-------  

Launch of Columbia is due on March 3 on mission STS-62. The payload bay
contains three cross-bay MPESS class pallets. Two of them comprise the
USMP-2 (United States Microgravity Payload 2), a set of crystal growth
experiments. The experiments are: AADSF (Advanced Automated Directional
Solidification Furnace), CFLSE (Critical Fluid Light Scattering
Experiment), IDGE (Isothermal Dendritic Growth Experiment), Mephisto
(Material Pour L'Etude Des Phenomenes Interessant La Solidification Sur
Terre Et En Orbite) and SAMS (Space Acceleration Measurement System).
USMP-1 flew on STS-52 in 1992 and carried Mephisto, SAMS and another
experiment called LPE.

The third pallet is a Hitchhiker-M class pallet and carries a bunch of
space technology experiments, many with relevance to the Space Station.
The experiments study spacecraft glow, arcing in solar cells, and heat
pipes. The pallet is called OAST-2, after the NASA Office of Aeronautics
and Space Technology which originally sponsored it (now the office
is called Office of Advanced Concepts and Technology). OAST-1 flew on
Discovery's first flight in 1984 and carried a large array deployment test.

Possibly the most interesting aspect of the STS-62 mission, however,
is the DEE (Dexterous End Effector) experiment. This is a special
magnetic 'hand' for the RMS robot arm. Mission specialist Marsha
Ivins will use the arm to test the DEE, which may allow smaller
grapple fixtures to be used on future satellites.

The crew of STS-62 is very experienced; commander is John Casper,
(STS-36, STS-54), pilot is Andy Allen (STS-46); mission
specialists are Pierre Thout (STS-36, STS-49 Intelsat spacewalk),
Marsha Ivins (STS-32R, STS-36) and Sam Gemar (STS-38, STS-48). 

 
Launches
--------

The Chinese Shi Jian 4 satellite and the dummy DFH-3 communications
satellite have now had orbital data made public. Shi Jian 4 is
in a 208 x 36134 km x 28.6 deg orbit.

Six satellites launched on Feb 12 by an 11K68 Tsiklon launch vehicle
from Plesetsk are part of a network of small communications satellites,
possibly operated by Russian intelligence agencies.

The second Galaxy IR satellite was launched on Feb 19 from Cape
Canaveral. Galaxy IR, operated by Hughes Communications, replaces a
satellite of the same name which was lost during launch in 1992. That in
turn was intended to replace the Galaxy I satellite still on orbit. Here
is the list of Galaxy satellites:

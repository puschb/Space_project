Jonathan's Space Report

Editorial
--------

I think I've added everyone who has requested it so far 
to the distribution list - let me know if you don't get this message :-)
News is light this week.

Shuttle  
-------  

Endeavour departed Edwards AFB aboard the Boeing 747 Shuttle Carrier Aircraft
on Apr 29 and was flown to Biggs Army Airfield, El Paso, Texas. On Apr 30
the SCA/Orbiter combination flew to Dyess AFB, Abilene, Texas and then
on to Little Rock AFB, Arkansas. On May 2 the SCA took off again and
flew directly to Kennedy Space Center; the Orbiter will be towed
to Orbiter Processing Facility Bay 1 later today. [Does anyone know
which 747 was used - NASA 905 or 911?]

Mir
---

The EO-15 crew of Viktor Afanas'ev, Yuriy Usachyov and Vladimir Polyakov
remain aboard the Mir station after 114 days in orbit.
Physician-cosmonaut Polyakov, on his second spaceflight, has now
accumulated almost a year in space and is currently tenth in the all
time cumulative space experience rankings. Launch of the Progress M-23
robot cargo ship is scheduled for no earlier than May 18.

X-15
----

Advertisement: the Spring 1994 issue of the space history magazine Quest
will contain a set of articles on the X-15 rocketplane, including
one by the present author which contains the first ever complete
listing of X-15 flights. You might also want to check out the March
issue of Journal of the British Interplanetary Society which has
a neat article on the White Sands rocket base by Joel Powell, and
a dry and dull history of the Scout launch vehicle by myself.

LAUNCHES
--------

Michael Fennell reports that the SEDS 2 Delta stage is still in
orbit, with reentry expected around May 6. Part of the tether
is still attached.

Launch of Titan/Centaur TC-10 is expected from LC41 at Cape Canaveral on May 3.
The first Titan/Centaur launch, TC-12, was successfully carried out on Feb 7.

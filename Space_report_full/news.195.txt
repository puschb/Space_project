Jonathan's Space Report 
No. 195       1994 May 9

Shuttle  
-------  

Endeavour returned to KSC aboard the NASA 911 carrier aircraft on May 2.
Thanks to all those who passed on the identification of the aircraft.
Endeavour has been towed to Orbiter Processing Facility
Bay 1 and will be recycled for launch with the same Space Radar Lab
payload in August.

Assembly of the STS-65 stack is proceeding in the Vehicle Assembly
Building with preparations for connecting the external tank
to the solid boosters. The Spacelab module will be installed
in orbiter Columbia this week. Launch of STS-65 is due in July.

Mir ERRATUM
------------

My brain has been out to lunch recently - the physician cosmonaut aboard
Mir is of course Valeriy Vladimirovich Polyakov, not Vladimir Polyakov
as I have been typing recently. Thanks for everyone who caught that
piece of stupidity.

LAUNCHES
--------

The Deep Space Program Science Experiment probe, known to its friends as
Clementine, has completed mapping the Moon (and returned some
spectacular images!). Dean Bakeris reports that  Clementine left lunar
orbit on May 4 at 0324:15 UTC. Perigee was due on May 8 at 0556, and
apogee will be at 0530 on May 16, when a targeting maneuver will be
performed. Second perigee will be around May 24, and Clementine will fly
past the moon again on May 27 on its way to solar orbit. It will reach
asteroid (1620) Geographos at 2116 UTC on Aug 31. It is hoped to send
the probe on to fly by the unnumbered minor planet 1983 RD in October
1995.

The second Titan 4 Centaur, TC-10, was launched from Cape Canaveral on
May 3. The Titan solid boosters and core stages 1 and 2 fell in the
Atlantic Ocean, and the first Centaur burn placed the Centaur and its
payload into a parking orbit inclined at 57 deg (estimated). 
Observations from Europe of a bright comet like object over the US
suggest that the Centaur made a second burn in the southern hemisphere
to a highly elliptical orbit with apogee in the northern hemisphere. A
third burn may have been made to change the orbital inclination about
3.5 hours after launch. The Centaur then vented its excess propellants,
giving rise to the "comet". The best guess so far at the resulting orbit,
based on observations from Italy and the Czech Republic, is
a 12 hr period orbit around 64 degrees; a solution by Joel Runes gives
1323 x 39035 km x 64.4 deg, with TLEs as follows: 

1 23098E 94026B   94123.83406471  .00000000  00000-0  00000 0 0    52
2 23098  64.4000  14.6349 7100000 266.5000  93.5000  2.00600000    29
 
Work by Mike McCants gives similar estimates; the eccentricity is rather
uncertain. The object may be visible in binoculars to observers in the
US around 03h UTC tonight.  The payload, USA-103, is probably a signals
intelligence satellite, the third in a series which is a followon to
the National Security Agency's JUMPSEAT electronic monitoring series.
The first two payloads in the series were deployed by the Shuttle
and used an unknown upper stage (possibly an Orbus 7S solid motor)
to enter their 12 hour orbits.

 Advanced JUMPSEAT spacecraft:

The final launch of the Scout rocket took place at 0247 UTC on May 9. 
It placed the MSTI-2 (Miniature Seeker Technology Integration) satellite
in orbit for the Ballistic Missile Defense Organization.  The orbit is
360 x 461 km x 96.8 deg. Vehicle S218C was a Scout G-1 variant,
consisting of an Algol 3A first stage, a Castor 2 second stage, an
Antares 3 third stage, and a Thiokol Star 20 fourth stage. The launch
took place from Space Launch Complex 5 at Vandenberg Air Force Base,
which was originally Launch Complex D of Point Arguello Naval Missile
Facility when it saw its first Scout launch in 1962. S218C was the 125th
launch of an Algol-based Scout (including six launches of the USAF Blue
Scout version); there were also 22 launches of a variant called Blue
Scout Junior which omitted the first stage. Scout's first test flight
was on Apr 18, 1960; the first successful orbital launch on 16 Feb 1961
(Explorer IX). Among Scout's famous payloads were: Transit VA-3, the
first successful gravity gradient stabilized satellite; San Marco 1,
Italy's first satellite; ESRO 2B, Europe's first joint satellite (ESRO
was ESA's predecessor); Azur, Germany's first satellite; the Dutch
satellite ANS; and Uhuru and Ariel 5, the early X-ray astronomy
satellites.

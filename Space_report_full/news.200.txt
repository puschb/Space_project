The STS-65 stack consisting of orbiter OV-102 Columbia,
the external tank, and the solid rocket boosters, was moved
to pad 39A on June 15. 


LAUNCHES
--------

The Kosmos-2281 imaging satellite is in a 236 x 292 km x 82.6 deg orbit.

The 9th Foton materials processing spacecraft was launched from
Plesetsk on Jun 14. The Russian Space Agency's Foton program
carries Russian and international commercial experiments; Foton
contains a variety of microgravity ovens in its pressurized Vostok-class
descent module.

The second Intelsat VII communications satellite was orbited on
Jun 17. INTELSAT, the International Telecommunications Satellite Organization,
is an intergovernmental entity which has been launching
communications satellites since 1965. The seventh generation satellite
is built by Space Systems/Loral, has a mass of 1500 kg plus 2200 kg of fuel,
and with its solar panels deployed has a wingspan of 22 metres.
The communications payload consists of 10 Ku-band and 26 C-band transponders.
Intelsat 702 will be inserted into geostationary orbit and be stationed
over Africa at longitude 1 deg W.

The Ariane V64 launch vehicle which carried Intelsat 702 to space also
carried an ASAP structure which holds small piggyback satellites. Two
tiny (0.5m) satellites were carried on this mission, the STRV  (Space
Technology Research Vehicle) satellites for the United Kingdom Ministry
of Defense's Defence Research Agency (DRA). DRA is the new name for the
RAE (Royal Aircraft Establishment) at Farnborough, the home of the
famous air show. RAE was the lead agency for all of Britain's technology
(as opposed to science or communications) satellites. STRV 1A has a mass
of 50 kg and carries experiments to study surface erosion effects on
spacecraft materials, a cosmic ray detector, and a gamma ray burst
experiment. STRV 1B, with a mass of 53 kg, has an experimental cooler,
solar cells, and electronics. The satellites will remain in
geostationary transfer orbit.

Here's a list of the RAE's satellites:
  X-2            1970 Sep  2   Failed to orbit
  Orba           1970 Sep  2   Failed to orbit
  Prospero (X-3) 1971 Oct 28   The only satellite launched by a British rocket
  Miranda  (X-4) 1974 Mar  9   Launched by a US Scout
  STRV 1A, 1B    1994 Jun 17   Small DRA test satellites

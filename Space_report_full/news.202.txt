A serious goof in the first version of this report, so I'm
trying again. Please delete the previous version!

Shuttle
-------

Launch of STS-65 is still due on July 8.

LAUNCHES
--------

NPO Energiya's Soyuz spacecraft 11F732 no. 68 was launched at 12:24:50
UTC on Jul 1 from Baykonur, becoming Soyuz TM-19 on reaching orbit.
Soyuz TM-19 carried the Mir EO-16 crew (callsign: "Agat") to the orbital
complex, and docked at the rear port of the Kvant module (vacated by
Progress M-23 on Jul 2) at 13:55:01 UTC on Jul 3. The EO-16 crew
commander is Lt-Col.  Yuriy Ivanovich Malenchenko of the Russian Air
Force. The flight engineer is Lt-Col. Talgat Bigeldinovich Musabaev,
also of the Russian Air Force. Both men are currently members of the
Russian Air Force cosmonaut detachment, although Musabaev is a Kazakh
and was originally selected as backup for the Kazakh mission to Mir
flown by Tokhtar Aubakirov in 1991. The EO-16 crew will replace two of
the EO-15 crewmembers currently aboard Mir,  Viktor Afanas'ev and Yuriy
Usachyov, who will land back on Earth on Jul 9. Physician-cosmonaut
Valeriy Polyakov will remain aboard Mir with the EO-16 crew.

Orbital Sciences' revolutionary Pegasus winged launch vehicle suffered
its first complete launch failure on Jun 27. The modified Lockheed
L-1011 carrier plane took off from Vandenberg AFB, California and
released the first Pegasus XL over the Point Arguello Warning Area at
2115 UTC. The rocket malfunctioned during the first stage burn and was
destroyed. Payload on this sixth Pegasus launch was the US Air Force
Space Test Program's STEP Mission 1 satellite. STEP 1 was a DSI/TRW
Eagle class light satellite carrying radio propagation experiments, a
plasma environment analyser, the CHAMPION ionosphere-magnetosphere
coupling experiment, and an accelerometer and mass spectrometer to study
the upper atmosphere.

In last week's report, I should have noted that Martin Marietta have
bought the old General Dynamics launch vehicle group. Therefore, the
recent Atlas I  AC-76 flight was a Martin Marietta launch, not a General
Dynamics one. Apologies to Martin Marietta and its Atlas Centaur team
for the misattribution.

The UHF F/O F-3 satellite launched by AC-76 carries 39 UHF
communications channels (21 narrow band, 17 relay, and 1 Fleet
Broadcast). This HS-601 class satellite is owned by Hughes Space and
Communications, and will be delivered to the US Navy's Space Command
once it has been checked out in geostationary orbit. Launch of AC-76
occurred at 1350:02 UTC; the booster engines were jettisoned within
three minutes and the Atlas main stage fell away at  1354. The first
Centaur burn ended at 1400, placing the Centaur/HS-601 in parking orbit
a few hundred km above the Earth. Centaur reignited at 1414 for a 70
second burn, and separated at 1418 UTC leaving the HS-601 in a 221 x
15600 km x 27 deg transfer orbit. The HS-601 later began burns
of its ARC 490N liquid apogee engine to raise the satellite's orbit
towards its operational geostationary height of 35780 x 35780 km x 0 deg.
However orbital details for the satellite have not been released; this
is unusual as earlier UHF F/O mission trajectories have been unclassified.

The satellite launched into a 63 degree orbit on Jul 3 is a Chinese FSW
(Fanhui Shi Weixing)  recoverable satellite launched from Jiuquan, and
not a Russian Kosmos from Plesetsk, as I suggested in the first version
of this report. Orbit of the FSW satellite is 173 x 342 km x 63.0 deg.
This is very similar to the orbits used by Russian's Yantar' satellites,
and the ground track of the satellite passes close to the Plesetsk
launch site on the first orbit before the actual launch, hence my
initial confusion.

The McDonnell Douglas DC-X reusable rocket has made two more test
flights, on Jun 20 and Jun 27. The second flight was aborted 
because of an explosion in the aft compartment at launch time; the
rocket made a successful emergency landing and the damage is reportedly
not severe.

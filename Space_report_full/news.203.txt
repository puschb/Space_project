Shuttle
-------

Space Shuttle Columbia was launched on mission STS-65 at 1643 UTC on Jul
8. This is Columbia's 17th flight and the long two week mission, if
successful, will significantly extend Columbia's record as the orbiter
with the most flight hours. On Jul 11 Columbia was in a 299 x 302 km
orbit inclined 28.5 deg to the equator. The Spacelab Long Module in the
cargo bay carries the International Microgravity Laboratory 2 payload.

Mir
---

The Progress M-23 cargo ship undocked and was deorbited on Jul 2. (I
don't know the time or whether it had a Raduga reentry capsule). Soyuz
TM-19 docked with the vacated rear port of the Kvant module on Jul 3, as
reported earlier. On Jul 9, the EO-15 commander and flight engineer,
Viktor Afanas'ev and Yuriy Usachyov, boarded the Soyuz TM-18 ferry
docked at the Mir front port, and undocked from the complex. Several
hours later they ignited the Soyuz braking engine, and the descent
module was separated from the orbital and instrument modules. The Soyuz
TM-18 descent module landed 110 km north of Arkalyk in Kazakhstan at
1032:35 UTC on Jul 9. Afanas'ev and Usachyov's flight time was 182 days
0 hr 27 min if my arithmetic is correct. This gives Afanas'ev a
cumulative flight time of 357 days 02 h 19 min over his two flights.
EO-15 physician-cosmonaut Valeriy Polyakov remains aboard Mir with the
new EO-16 crew of Malenchenko and Musabaev. 


Launches
--------

Ariane V.65 was launched at 2305 on Jul 8 from the Ensemble de Lancement
Ariane No. 2 at the Centre Spatial Guyanais at Kourou in Guyane, South
America. The 44L model Ariane has four liquid PAL strapon boosters on
the L220 first stage, an L33 second stage, and a high-energy H10+ third
stage. After the H10+ reached geostationary transfer orbit, the PanAmSat
2 satellite separated, followed by the cover of the SPELDA
dual-satellite adapter, followed finally by the BS-3N satellite.
PanAmSat 2 is owned by Alpha Lyracom, a Connecticut-based communications
company. It is a Hughes HS-601 model satellite with a liquid apogee
motor. BS-3N is owned by the Japanese NHK television company (it may be
renamed Yuri-3N on reaching orbit, since previous BS satellites owned by
the NASDA space agency were renamed in that way). It is a smaller GE3000
model built by Martin Marietta Astro Space (formerly GE, formerly RCA).

The Kosmos-2282 geostationary satellite launched on Jul 6
is apparently an early warning satellite in the Prognoz series.

A navigation satellite was launched from Plesetsk on Jul 14 into a 1000
km, 83 degree orbit. It is either a Nadezhda civil navsat or a Parus
navy navigation satellite.

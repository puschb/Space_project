Shuttle
-------

Columbia continues in orbit on the STS-65 mission.

Mir
---

I now have details of the Progress M-23 flight from Vladimir
Agapov. The Progress undocked from the Kvant module at
0946:46 UTC on Jul 2. The braking engine was ignited at
1444 UTC, and the Raduga VBK reentry capsule was ejected
at 1455:45 UTC. The Progress burnt up in the atmosphere
at 1457. The Raduga deployed its parachute after reentry
and landed at 1509 UT at 51 deg 41 min N, 59 deg 21 min E,
in the Orenburg region of Russia.

Launches
--------

The BS-3N satellite successfully fired its Star 30BP
apogee motor at 0306:31 UT on Jul 13. It is a Martin
Marietta Astro Space Series 3000 satellite (I said
GE3000 last week, but that's the old name for the bus).

A Nadezhda ("Hope") navigation, search and rescue satellite
was launched from Plesetsk on Jul 14. Nadezhda satellites
are produced and designed by AO Polyot of Omsk and NPO Prikladnoi
Mekhaniki of Krasnoyarsk. They operate in 1000 km orbits
at 83 degree inclination.

Fireworks on Jupiter
--------------------

The fragments of Comet 1993e (P/Shoemaker-Levy 9) have begun to impact
Jupiter. Fragment G, which hit on Jul 18, left an impact site larger
than the Earth. The impact sites are visible in small telescopes; the
150-year-old 12" Northumberland refractor in Cambridge has contributed
central meridian crossing times (these are the most important things for
amateurs to note, as the longitudes and rotation periods of the
individual sites are not all well determined).

Not So Recent Launches
----------------------

Saturn SA-506 was launched from LC39A at Cape Kennedy on 1969 Jul 16 at
1332 UTC inserting the S-IVB-506 third stage and attached Apollo 11
spacecraft into a 188 x 192 km x 32.6 deg Earth orbit. At 1616 the S-IVB
reignited for the TLI burn; Apollo CSM 107 separated at 1649, completed
the transposition and docking maneuver at 1656, and separated with the
attached Lunar Module 5 at 1749. Lunar orbit insertion of the CSM 107/
LM 5 complex occurred at 1721 on Jul 19. On Jul 20, Apollo 11 Commander
Neil A. Armstrong and LM Pilot Edwin E. Aldrin, Jr. transferred to LM 5,
leaving CM Pilot Michael Collins in the CSM. At 1745 on Jul 20, LM 5
(callsign "Eagle") undocked from the CSM 107 (callsign "Columbia") in a
100 x 122 km lunar orbit. The Descent Orbit Insertion burn at 1908
lowered LM 5's orbit to 16 x 106 km. At 2005 the Powered Descent
Initiation burn was begun, and at 1969 Jul 20 d 20 h 17 m 40 s UTC the
spaceship LM 5 "Eagle" carrying astronauts Armstrong and Aldrin landed
at Tranquility Base, Statio Tranquillitatis (00 deg 41 ' 15 " N 23 deg
26 ' 00 " E) in the Mare Tranquillitatis on Luna.

Exploration of the Tranquility Base area was carried out from 0227 to
0458 on Jul 21 by Armstrong (in spacesuit A7L56) and Aldrin (in suit
A7L77). LM 5 was again depressurized from 0740 to 0745? for an equipment
dump. LM 5's ascent stage was launched from the descent stage at 1754 on
Jul 21 and reached a 17 x 84 km lunar orbit at 1801. The LM 5 ascent
stage docked with CSM 107 at 2135 on Jul 21. After the crew and cargo
were transferred, LM 5 was undocked at 2342. CSM 107 fired its SPS
engine at 0455 for the transearth injection burn. The SM-107 service
module was jettisoned at 1621 on Jul 24 and the CM began reentry at
1635. At 1650 on Jul 24 the CM-107 "Columbia" landed at 13 deg 30 ' N
169 deg 15 ' W in the Pacific Ocean, and was recovered by the carrier
USS Hornet.

Meanwhile, flight 5L (the second test launch) of the N-1 lunar launch
vehicle resulted in a massive explosion at 2018 on 1969 Jul 3, damaging
the N-1 launch pad at Baykonur. Luna E-8-5 sample return probe no. 401
was launched by Proton-K at 0255 on 1969 Jul 13 from Baykonur and given
the code name Luna-15. Luna-15 reached lunar orbit at 1000 on 1969 Jul
17 but the attempted landing at 1552 UT on 1969 Jul 21 resulted in
destruction of the spacecraft on impact at 17 N 60 E.

Shuttle
-------

Endeavour and the STS-68 stack was rolled out to pad 39A on Jul 27. In
the orbiter's payload bay is the Space Radar Lab, which first flew on
Endeavour's last flight (STS-59 in April). This is the first time that
the same main payload has flown on two successive flights of an orbiter.
(In 1991 and 1992 the Unit 1 Spacelab Long Module flew on successive
flights of Columbia, but the experiment payload was changed from 
Spacelab Life Sciences to International Microgravity Lab).  SRL-2
carries JPL's SIR-C Shuttle Imaging Radar and the German/Italian X-SAR
radar. Also aboard are an MPESS pallet carrying the MAPS (Measurement of
Air Pollution from Satellites) experiment on its fourth flight, and
Getaway Special payloads G-316 (North Carolina A&T Univ. student biology
and chemistry experiments), G-503 (U of Alabama Huntsville SEDS student
experiments) and G-541 (Swedish Space Corp. gradient furnace for crystal
growth experiment). US Postal Service commemorative Apollo 11
anniversary covers will also be carried in two GAS cans. Launch of
STS-68 is due on Aug 18 at 1054 UTC.

Launches
--------

Martin Marietta Commercial Launch Services (formerly the General Dynamics
team) successfully launched an Atlas IIA from Cape Canaveral on Aug 3.
The AC-107 Centaur stage and the Hughes HS-601 satellite payload were
delivered into a 211 x 39459 km x 26.9 deg geostationary transfer orbit.
The satellite, named DBS-2, is a direct broadcast TV satellite jointly
owned by DirecTV (a subsidiary of Hughes) and USSB (United States
Satellite Broadcasting, a subsidiary of Hubbard Broadcasting). Its
ARC490N liquid fuel apogee engine will be fired several times to raise
the orbit to a circular geostationary one. [Thanks to special correspondent
Joel Runes for his report from the launch site.]
This was the second launch of the Atlas IIA configuration (the IIAS has
also flown once). All Atlas II class flights have been successful:

 (MM = Martin Marietta)

Orbital Sciences Corporation also had a successful launch earlier the
same day. NASA's NB-52 carrier aircraft took off from Edwards AFB around
1325 UTC and dropped a standard Pegasus over the Point Arguello Warning
Area at 1439 UTC on Aug 3 and the three stage solid rocket successfully
inserted the APEX satellite into the intended orbit. APEX (Advanced
Photovoltaic and Electronics Experiments) is an OSC Pegastar bus and
carries a variety of advanced solar cell experiments for the US Air
Force: Photovoltaic Array and Space Power Plus Diagnostics (PASP-Plus),
Ferroelectric Experiment (FERRO), and Cosmic Ray Upset Experiment
(CRUX). Versions of CRUX have previously flown as Shuttle GAS can
experiments. The APEX satellite is part of the USAF Space Test Program
and also has the designation P90-6. The intended orbit was 360 x 2000 km
x 70 deg, and the actual one was 365 x 2551 km x 69.9 deg. The
elliptical orbit gives high plasma densities at perigee and high
radiation levels at apogee; the USAF reports that the orbit achieved is
excellent for the mission. [Thanks to V. Arruda of USAF for info]. In
June, the first launch of an advanced Pegasus XL from the L-1011 
Stargazer carrier plane ended in failure; the cause has been identified
as aerodynamic problems due to faulty hydro simulations (no wind tunnel
testing was done). The Pegasus XL will probably be cleared for flight
later in the year. 

Kosmos-2284, launched Jul 29, is an imaging satellite. Based on its
orbit, it is presumably the 17th in the 'Kometa' series of topographic
mapping satellites, based on the Yantar' spy satellite design. Vladimir
Agapov reports that the Kometa satellite imagery is commercially
distributed by AO Sovinformsputnik.  The last Kometa satellite,
Kosmos-2243, was damaged during launch in Apr 1993. Typical mission
length is 44 days. The first Kometa satellite was Kosmos-1246, in 1981.
All the Kometa satellites are launched by Soyuz-U from Baykonur.

Kosmos-2285 was launched Aug 2 by the light Kosmos-3M launch vehicle.
Kosmos-3M, built by PO Polyot of Omsk, is derived from the R-14 (NATO
designation SS-5) IRBM built originally by the Yangel design bureau.
Kosmos-2285 was inserted in a 974 x 1013 km x 74.0 deg orbit, which is
quite unusual. The altitude range is that used by Parus-class navigation
satellites, but the inclination has not been used by those satellites
since the early 1970s. The most likely missions for Kosmos-2285 are
radar calibration or geodesy.

I have confirmed that the Apstar 1 satellite was launched
using the CZ-3 (Long March 3) and not the more advanced CZ-3A,
and that the launch time was 1055 UT on Jul 21 (Chen Baosheng, CGWIC, 
personal communication). On Aug 7, Apstar 1 was in a 35646 x 35920 km 
x 0.04 deg orbit stationary over 138.4 deg E. Some other recent
geostationary satellites are also now on station: PAS 2 at 165.4W;
BS-3N at 122.0E, and Kosmos-2282 at 24.1W. Elements for UHF F/O F3
have not been released.


Erratum
-------

Progress M-23 was undocked at 0847 UTC and not 0947 UTC on Jul 2.
Apologies for the error which was caused by confusion between
Moscow decree time and Moscow daylight time. (Thanks Sven for catching this.)

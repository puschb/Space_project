Shuttle
-------

The next Shuttle mission is STS-64. The orbiter Discovery
will carry a variety of science payloads. The payload
bay will contain:
 1) a Spacelab pallet with the LIDAR In-Space Technology
Experiment (LITE). LITE's laser transmitter
and telescope receiver will be used to make atmospheric
measurements and demonstrate laser measurement technology.
 2) an MPESS pallet with the Spartan 201 solar observatory
on its second mission; it will be deployed for two days of
observations of the solar south pole, to coordinate with
the Ulysses data.
 3) SPIFEX, the Shuttle Plume Impingement Flight Experiment.
This is a package of instruments on a 10m boom to be attached
to the RMS arm. It's for testing what happens when the Shuttle
maneuvers near another spacecraft such as a space station.
 4) an MPESS type GAS Bridge pallet carrying 10 GAS (Getaway Special)
canisters.
 5) A sidewall Hitchhiker-G pallet carrying the
ROMPS (Robot Operated Materials Processing System), two GAS cans
testing use of robotics in space processing.
 6) SAFER Recharge Station, a nitrogen gas refuelling station for
the  SAFER (Simplified Aid for EVA Rescue), a new propulsive
spacesuit backpack to be tested by Mark Lee and Carl Meade
on a spacewalk. The Recharge Station is on the
payload bay wall; SAFER itself will be stored in the crew cabin.



Launches
--------

Progress M-24 failed to dock with Mir on Aug 27. A second automatic docking
attempt on Aug 30 also failed. A third and final attempt, manually
controlled by Mir commander Yuriy Malenchenko, was successful on Sep 2.

Kiku-6's LAPS apogee motor failed to develop the correct thrust when it
was fired on Aug 31 at 0519 UT.  The LAPS was separated at 1510 UTC,
leaving Kiku-6 in a 7791 x 38715 km x 13.1 deg transfer orbit
instead of the intended geostationary one.

The USA-105 satellite, launched by Titan 4 Centaur from pad 41
at Cape Canaveral, is believed to have entered geostationary orbit.
It may be the first of a new series of geostationary signals 
intelligence satellites, following on from the MAGNUM satellites
launched from the Shuttle since 1985. 

The Magellan Venus probe lowered its periapsis to 182 km 
on Sep 25 in preparation for the Windmill experiment to
study the amount of torque produced by the Venusian upper
atmosphere.

Kosmos-2290 was launched by a Zenit rocket from Baykonur
on Aug 26 into a 211 x 292 km x 64.8 deg orbit. This type
of orbit suggests that it may be the first of a new generation
of imaging reconnaissance satellites. All previous Soviet
and Russian imaging spy satellites were launched by
derivatives of the R-7 ICBM, the most recent of which are
the 11A511U and 11A511U2 variants of the Soyuz booster. This
would mark the first use of the Zenit for a spy satellite,
although 1987 test flights of the rocket which placed
inert satellites into similar orbits may have been related.


Optus B3 was launched by a Chang Zheng 2E (Long March) rocket
from the Xichang space center in China on Aug 27. Optus 
is an Australian telecommunications company. The CZ-2E placed
the Optus satellite into a 189 x 1084 km orbit at an inclination
of 27.8 deg. The Thiokol Star 63F solid perigee motor then
fired to place Optus B3 in a 383 x 39123 km x 24.1 deg transfer
orbit. Optus B3 will  use its own liquid apogee motor to raise
the orbit to a circular geostationary one. The satellite is
a Hughes HS-601 comsat and replaces Optus B2, which disintegrated
during launch in Dec 1992. The Optus B satellites are successors
to the Aussat K series launched in the 1980s.

The 12th Block 5D Defense Meteorological Satellite Program spacecraft
was orbited by a refurbished Atlas E from Vandenberg Air Force Base in
California on Aug 29. DMSP F-12, or DMSP 23545 as it is also known, is
built by  Martin Marietta Astro Space and based on the Tiros-N bus also
used by the civilian NOAA weather satellites.

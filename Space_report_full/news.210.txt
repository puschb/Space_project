Shuttle
-------

Shuttle mission STS-64 was launched at 2222:53 UTC on Sep 9 from pad 39B
at Kennedy Space Center. The Redesigned Solid Rocket Motors
separated at 2 min into the flight, and the lightweight External
Tank, ET-66, was jettisoned at 9 min after launch, just after main
engine cutoff. Orbit on Sep 10.6 was 253 x 266 km x 57.0 deg.
This is Discovery's 19th flight into space.

One of the main payloads is LITE (the Lidar In-Space Technology Experiment).
Lidar is essentially radar using an optical wavelength laser instead
of microwaves. LITE consists of a Spacelab pallet with a laser
transmitter and a receiver telescope. In an interesting historical
note, the 96-cm receiver telescope was built in the 1960s
as the engineering model for the telescope on the OAO-B satellite,
lost in a 1970 launch failure. It was refurbished for the LITE mission.

Mir
---

The Mir commander and flight engineer, Yuriy Malenchenko and
Talgat Musabaev, made a spacewalk on Sep 9 to inspect the damage
to the Kvant module made by Progress M-24 when it collided with
Kvant during its second attempted docking on Aug 30. [I don't
have the start time or duration of this EVA yet]. Valeriy Polyakov,
station doctor, stayed inside Mir during the EVA.

Launches
--------

AT&T Skynet Satellite Services' Telstar 402 was launched by an Ariane
42L on Sep 9 into a 224 x 35717 km orbit inclined 6.9 degrees. This
was the 30th Ariane 4 launch, and the 28th successful one. The payload
was a Martin Marietta Astro Space Series 7000 satellite, the second
to be launched. It carried 24 C-band and 16 Ku-band transponders,
and a pair of UK Royal Ordnance bipropellant Leros liquid apogee engines.
A few minutes after Telstar 402 separated from the Ariane H10+ third stage,
controllers commanded the spacecraft tanks to be pressurized. Telemetry
indicates that an explosion occurred at this point and all contact with
the satellite was lost. The first Series 7000 satellite, Telstar 401,
continues to operate successfully in geostationary orbit.

More details on the DMSP launch: DMSP F-12 (23545) is a Martin Marietta
(formerly GE, formerly RCA, soon to be Lockheed Martin) Astro Space
Block 5D-2 class USAF weather satellite. Launch was  at 1738 UTC on Aug
29, and the launch vehicle was a Martin Marietta (formerly General
Dynamics, formerly Convair) Atlas. This particular rocket was Atlas 20E,
a refurbished ICBM originally built in the early 1960s. 
56 Atlas E rockets have been launched, with a variety of payloads:
Atlas 11E and two others remain in the inventory.

The Kosmos-2290 spy satellite was launched on Aug 26 into a 211 x 292 km
orbit at an inclination of 64.8 degrees. It raised its orbit from 208 x
280 km  to 208 x 348 km on Sep 6.  This confirms that 2290 is indeed an
active payload, and supports the interpretation that it is an imaging
spy satellite. Earlier low orbit Zenit launches were just dummy
satellites which made no manouevres.

Causality Erratum
-----------------

Magellan's orbit trim was on Aug 25, not on Sep 25 as I claimed in JSR
209.

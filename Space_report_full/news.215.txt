Shuttle
-------

The next Shuttle mission is STS-66, due for launch on Nov 3.
This will be the first flight of Atlantis since its refurbishment.
Payloads include the Atlas-3 earth observing Spacelab pallet and the
CRISTA free flyer SPAS satelite.

Mir
---

The Mir complex is undergoing power difficulties and the crew's
experiments were interrupted for several days. The station's
solar panels will be in a more favorable orientation this
week and normal operations should resume. The Mir complex
consists of the core module, the Kvant astrophysical module,
the Kvant-2 airlock module, and the Kristall module. Soyuz TM-19
is docked at the Kvant rear port and Soyuz TM-20 is docked at
the Mir forward port.

Recent Launches
---------------

The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) scored a success on Oct 15
with the launch of its PSLV Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (The first
PSLV failed in Sep 1993). The four stage rocket orbited the 870 kg IRS-P2
satellite into a 798 x 882 km x 99 deg polar orbit. IRS-P2 is part of
the Indian Remote Sensing satellite series. Developed by the ISRO Satellite
Centre in Bangalore, it carries the LISS-II (Linear Imaging Self Scanner)
CCD camera with a 32m resolution and four visible and near infrared bands.

  IRS satellites:

  IRS-1A  1988 Mar 17  Vostok, Baykonur       870 x 914 km x 99.0 deg
  IRS-1B  1991 Aug 29  Vostok, Baykonur       862 x 918 km x 99.2 deg
  IRS-1E  1993 Sep 20  PSLV-D1, Sriharikota    (Failed)
  IRS-P2  1994 Oct 15  PSLV-D2, Sriharikota   798 x 882 km x 98.7 deg

The PSLV first stage (PS-1) is a 129 tonne solid motor 2.8m in dia with
a thrust of 4500 kN. Six strap-on HTPB/Ammonium Perchlorate solid motors
of 662 kN are attached, two of which ignite at launch, the other four
igniting 30 sec later. The first two separate at 73s, the remaining four
are jettisoned at 90s. At T+111s the PS-1 falls away and the PS-2
ignites. This is a 38 tonne liquid fuel stage (India's first) using
UDMH/N2O4. The single Vikas engine has a thrust of 725 kN. At T+154s the
vehicle reached 117 km altitude and the fairing was jettisoned, with
second stage separation at 261s. The third stage (PS-3) is a 7 tonne
solid motor with a thrust of 340 kN. It burns from T+261s to T+380s,
to an altitude of 421 km. The payload and attached PS-4 stage now
coast in transfer trajectory until T+591.4s when the PS-4's MMH/N2O4
liquid engine ignites for a 397s burn. PS-4 and IRS-P2 separated at
T+1012s. [Source: ISRO Press Release, 1994 Oct 15].



The first Ekspress communications satellite was launched on Oct 13. The
Ekspress satellites, operated by AO Informkosmos, will replace the
Gorizont domestic TV relay satellites which the Soviet Union introduced
in 1979. Ekspress features a north-south stationkeeping capability which
will keep the inclination within 0.2 deg. The bus is 3.6 x 6.1 m in size
with a solar array span of 21m, and has a mass of 2500 kg. The payload
includes ten C-band and two Ku-band (14/11 GHz) transponders. The launch
used a Proton-K rocket with the 11S861-01 (uprated Blok DM-2) upper
stage. This is the second flight of this upper stage, which was used for
the Gals launch earlier this year. The next Proton launch is expected to
carry Elektro, the much delayed geostationary weather satellite first
planned for the late 1970s.
[Note for transponder fans: the C-band transponders are 
(6000-6450)/(3675-4125) MHz (with spacing 50 MHz) and the Ku band are
14325/11525 and 14475/11675 MHz. Bandwidth of each channel is 34 MHz.
Information on Ekspress is from Vladimir Agapov.]

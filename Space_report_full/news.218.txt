Shuttle
-------

STS-66 payload commander Ellen Ochoa grappled the CRISTA-SPAS payload
with the RMS arm at 2154 on Nov 3, but left it berthed in the payload
bay overnight. On Nov 4 Atlantis was in a 296 x 310 km x 57.0 deg orbit.
CRISTA-SPAS was deployed from Atlantis on Nov 4 at 1250UT, and Atlantis
moved away to a distance of 90 km from the satellite. The orbit was
lowered on Nov 5 to 291 x 310 km, and again on Nov 6 to 290 x 307 km. By
Nov 11 Atlantis was in a 287 x 301 km orbit and beginning its return to
the vicinity of SPAS.

The external tank for STS-63 was mated to the solid rocket boosters
on Nov 8 in the vehicle assembly building.

Mir
---

Soyuz TM-19 undocked from Mir at 0729 UT on Nov 4. The Soyuz instrument
module (PAO, priborno-agregatniy otsek) fired its deorbit engine, and
was jettisoned together with the orbital module (BO, bitovoy otsek) at
1051 UT, with entry interface for the descent module (SA, spuskaemiy
apparat) at 1054. It landed 170 km north-east of Arkalyk in Kazakhstan
on 1994 Nov 4 at 1118 UT. Cosmonauts Yuriy Malenchenko, Talgat Musabaev
and Ulf Merbold were aboard. Progress M-25 was launched on Nov 11 at 0722
carrying supplies and experiments toward the station. The EO-17 crew
aboard includes Valeriy Polyakov, who on Nov 5 passed the cumulative
duration record (total career time in space) of 541 days set by Musa
Manarov. Polyakov's current spaceflight has lasted 306 days so far,
longer than all but three expeditions: Sergey Krikalyov in 1991 (311
days), Yuri Romanenko in 1987 (326 days), and Titov and Manarov in 1988
(365 days). Meanwhile, Elena Kondakova broke the record for the duration
of a single spaceflight by a woman (of 14 days, held by NASA's Rhea
Seddon and Shannon Lucid) and Shannon Lucid's cumulative duration record
of 34 days - Kondakova has now been in space for 38 days. Ulf Merbold
broke Jean-Loup Chretien's record for spaceflights by a non-Soviet,
non-American, with a 31 day  mission and a career total of 49 days 21h
38min (more than any currently active US astronaut).

Recent Launches
---------------

The third Resurs-O1 spacecraft was launched on Nov 4. The two previous
spacecraft, codenamed Kosmos-1689 and Kosmos-1939, were launched by
the obsolete Vostok booster, and this was the first to use the newer,
Ukranian-built, Zenit launch vehicle.

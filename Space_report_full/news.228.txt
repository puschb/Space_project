Shuttle
--------

STS-63 remains scheduled for Feb 2. The press kit is now out
and gives more details on the planned payloads (thanks also
to S. Pickard of Spacehab for info) -
 The Spacelab Tunnel Adapter will connect the Orbiter middeck
to the Spacehab module and contains the airlock hatch to be
used for EVA.

 Spacehab FU-1 will make its second flight on the Spacehab SH-03
mission. Flight Unit 1 first flew in June 1993 (SH-01), while
the SH-02 mission in Feb 1994 used FU-2. The Spacehab module
is a pressurized laboratory containing experiment racks
and lockers. FU-1 has a new window in the roof to help in the
Mir rendezvous operation.

 The Spartan Flight Support Structure (SFSS) is an MPESS class
cross-bay truss structure on which Spartan 204 is mounted.
The Spartan satellites are small free flyers deployed by the
RMS robot arm for a couple of days and then retrieved. SPTN-204
carries NRL's FUVIS Far Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph which will
be used to study the Shuttle environment and make astronomical
observations. This is the first Spartan mission to be sponsored
by the USAF Space Test Program rather than NASA.

 A second MPESS will carry a Hitchhiker-M class payload, 
CGP-ODERACS II. The payload comprises several experiments:
the Cryo System Experiment (CSE), the GLO-2 Shuttle glow experiment,
the IMAX cargo bay camera, and the ODERACS II canister which 
will release six subsatellites: a 2-in diameter steel sphere,
a 4-in diameter Al sphere, a 6-in dia. Al sphere, a 1.7 in 
length dipole wire, and two 5.2-in long dipole wires. 
(For readers living in 20th century countries, 1 in = 25.4 mm). 

 The TCS (Trajectory Control Sensor, DTO-700-5) rendezvous experiment,
which has flown repeatedly,  will be mounted on the payload bay wall. 

 Mission specialists Foale and Harris will make an EVA to test modified
EMU spacesuits and conduct a mass handling exercise in which SPTN-204
will be manually unberthed, moved around, and reberthed. I believe this
EVA is probably the experiment referred to in the manifest as EDFT-1
(maybe it stands for EMU Development Flight Test?).

 The highlight of the mission should be Detailed Test Objective DTO 835,
the Mir Approach Demonstration.

Errata
------

Rick Cooper of Martin Marietta reports that Intelsat 704's initial
perigee was 200 km, not 306 km; for readers of my Sky and Telescope
column Mission Update, note the major goof this month about Galileo:
its orbit insertion engine is a liquid propellant system, not
a Star 48 solid motor. Don't know how that one crept into my brain...
I seem to have made up several sentences of pure fantasy. Oh well, 
thanks to Drew Lepage for catching it.
Pressure of work has delayed the annual launch summary, but don't
worry, I'll get to it soon.

New Launches
------------

More details on EXPRESS: The TVC (thrust vector control) on the second
stage malfunctioned 103 seconds after launch, and the fourth stage and
payload eventually entered a 110 x 250 km x 33 deg orbit (source: Av
Week), instead of the intended 270 x 380 km one.  The reentry capsule
and the service module, still attached to each other, reentered over the
Pacific between 1600 and 1630, on its second orbit of the Earth. US
Space Command have not allocated it a satellite number, and have
allocated the next international designation (1995-02) to the later
Tsikada launch, although the international agreement (in force since the
early 1960s) is that anything which completes one orbit should get an
international designation whether the US tracks it or not.  It is
possible that an out-of-sequence international designation will be
allocated later, as was done on several occasions, e.g. for the secret
Soviet launch 1966-88A which was launched between 1966-83A and 1966-84A.

Yoshiro Yamada reports that ISAS says the EXPRESS launch vehicle's
fourth stage was a modified KM-M solid motor The KM-M was first used for
the MUSES/Hiten launch. The reentry vehicle carried two CATEX materials
processing ovens, and three German (CETEX, PYREX and RAFLEX) and one
Japanese (RTEX) heat shield material reentry experiments.

A Tsikada navigation satellite was launched by Kosmos-3M from Plesetsk
at 0354 UTC on Jan 24 into a 965 x 1020 km x 82.9 deg orbit. 
The Tsikada series of navigation satellites uses
similar technology to the US Navy's Transit system. This Tsikada
satellite was equipped with a special adapter and carried two
microsatellites into orbit, ASTRID and FAISAT. 

ASTRID is the Swedish Space Corporation's latest space physics
satellite, using the new Freja-C bus, a 0.4 m cube with 4 solar panel
wings. The payload, which will emphasize studies of energetic neutral
particles in the Earth's magnetosphere, includes PIPPI, the neutral
particle imager; MIO, the miniature UV imaging system (with optical, UV
continuum and Lyman alpha monitors) and EMIL, an electron spectrometer.
The 26 kg satellite separated from the Tsikada adapter at 0458 UTC.

FAISAT is a 114 kg store and forward communications satellite modified
by Final Analysis, Inc., an American company from an existing satellite
bus whose mission was cancelled (probably a DARPA satellite).  It
separated from the adapter at 0919 UTC.

A Chinese Long March (Chang Zheng) 2E launch vehicle was destroyed one
minute after takeoff on Jan 25. The payload, Asia Pacific Telecom (APT)
Satellite Co's Apstar 2 communications satellite, was lost. It was a
Hughes HS-601 comsat; Apstar 1, launched in Jul 1994 by CZ-3, was an
HS-376 model.

Review  - "Novosti Kosmonavtiki" and "Russian Space News"
------

From time to time I review interesting books and periodicals in this
newsletter. For readers of Russian, the biweekly magazine Novosti
Kosmonavtiki is unquestionably the best source available on the Russian
space program. The magazine covers the Mir program, cosmonaut training,
the Russian satellite and launch vehicle programs, and both history and
future plans, as well as providing Russian coverage of US and other
nations' space programs. The coverage is technical (in the sense that
this newsletter is), lots of facts and figures, designations and serial
numbers, but also comprehensive - e.g. voice transcripts of crucial
mission phases, direct interviews with the orbiting cosmonauts by the
editors - and serious journalism, not just parroting the Russian Space
Agency's - uh, I guess "party line" would be the wrong word nowadays,
but you know what I mean. For those who don't read Russian, Charles
Radley's Tranquest Corp. provides Russian Space News, a partial
translation into English of Novosti Kosmonavtiki. Only those articles
dealing with the Russian program are translated, since that's the
information not available in other English language publications. The
translation is not that great, but it does get the essential info
across, and the latest issue seems better than the first few attempts.

Articles in 1994 issue no 22, which just arrived on my desk
in both versions, contain the following Russian space news articles:
 - 12 densely packed pages covering Mir activities from Oct 22
to Nov 4, including all the details you could want on Soyuz TM-19's
undocking and landing;
 - the complete planned Mir flight program for 1995;
 - extensive details of the Elektro, K-2293, Resurs, Okean and other satellites,
   including info on the previously unknown Vektor, Yug and Romb
   calibration satellites hidden in the Kosmos program;
 - report on the failure investigation of the May 1994 Tsiklon launch,
 - Biographies of the Soyuz TM-20 crew.

I understand that the subscription rates for individuals in the US are
$? for the Russian language version (Novosti Kosmonavtiki, Videokosmos,
12/3 Akademika Koroleva, Moscow 127427, Russia) and $75 (currently, but
may go up substantially) for the English version (Tranquest Corporation,
PO Box 30208, Cleveland Ohio 44130 USA).

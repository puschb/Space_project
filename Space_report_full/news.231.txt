Shuttle
--------

Endeavour is now on complex 39 at Kennedy Space Center awaiting its
March 2 launch on the Astro 2 flight (STS-67). Astro 2 is a Spacelab
mission, using two Spacelab Pallets with the Spacelab Igloo avionics
container and the IPS instrument pointing system. 
Mounted on the IPS are three ultraviolet telescopes. The
0.9-m Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope (HUT) takes spectra in the 900 to
1900 Angstrom short wavelength UV range and the 500 to 900 A extreme
ultraviolet range. The 0.5m Wisconsin Ultraviolet Photo-Polarimeter
Experiment (WUPPE) telescope studies spectra in the longer wavelength
1400-3200A ultraviolet range. The 0.38m Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope
(UIT) is a wide-field (0.6 degree) imaging telescope which uses
ultraviolet-sensitive film.
 Also in the cargo bay are the Extended Duration Orbiter (EDO) pallet
and two Getaway Special (GAS) cans (G-387/G-388) which constitute the 
Endeavour Telescope, a project of the Australian Space Office.
The 0.1m telescope takes a narrow-band, 2-degree wide-field ultraviolet
image. Unlike UIT, it uses CCDs rather than film. The Australian
Endeavour telescope first flew (as G-609/G-610) aboard Discovery in Jan 1992,
but failed to work correctly. On that mission it was attached to
a cross-bay GAS Bridge Assembly (GBA) with other GAS cans; this time the cans
are mounted on a GAS Beam Adapter (GABA) on the side of the payload bay wall.
(Note that the name of the telescope is nothing to do with the name of the
Shuttle except that both are named after Cook's ship.)


Mir
---

The Mir station raised its orbit on Feb 10; on Feb 10 its orbit was 390
x 391 km x 51.6 deg, 92.38 min; on Feb 20 it was in a 391 x 397 km x
51.6 deg, 92.45 min orbit. Progress vehicle no. 226 was launched on Feb
15,  and given the name Progress M-26 once reaching orbit. Progress M-25
undocked on Feb 16 (due at 1303 UT) and was deorbited. Progress M-26
then docked at the vacant Kvant docking port on Feb 17 (due at 1821 UT).
It carries experiments for the visit of US astronaut Norman Thagard
to Mir, due next month.

Recent Launches
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Foton No. 10 was launched from Plesetk on Feb 16 into a
219 x 368 km x 62.8 deg, 90.39 min orbit. The Foton recoverable
materials processing satellite, built by the Central Specialized Design
Bureau in Samara, is based on the Vostok/Zenit spy satellite bus.
This mission carries materials processing experiments from Germany and
France.

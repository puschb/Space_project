Shuttle
--------

Shuttle mission STS-67 was launched on Mar 2 at 0638:14 UT. The Astro-2
telescopes, HUT, WUPPE, and UIT appear to be operating well, as is the
IPS Instrument Pointing System. On Mar 11 it was in a 91.6 min, 341 x
360 km x 28.5 deg orbit. STS-67 is the 68th Shuttle flight and the
eighth flight of OV-105 Endeavour. Astro 2 is the fifth EDO (Extended
Duration Orbiter) flight and the eighteenth Spacelab mission (or
maybe only the 16th, did SRL-1 and SRL-2 count officially as Spacelab?).
Astro 2 uses the pressurized avionics container known as the Spacelab
Igloo to support the payload bay experiments; the Igloo previously
flew on Spacelab 2, Astro 1 and the three Atlas flights.
Crew of STS-67 are Commander Steve Oswald, Pilot William Gregory, 
Payload Commander Tamara Jernigan, Mission Specialists Wendy Lawrence
and John Grunsfeld, and Payload Specialists Ron Parise (Computer Sciences
Corp) and Sam Durrance (Johns Hopkins University).

Based on information obtained by Joel Runes, it appears the
ODERACS satellites deployed from STS-63 were deployed in the
following order (for those who *really* like to nitpick):

  ODERACS II-A, 10-cm sphere
  ODERACS II-D, 13 cm wire
  ODERACS II-C, 5-cm sphere
  ODERACS II-F, 4 cm wire
  ODERACS II-B, 15-cm sphere
  ODERACS II-E, 13 cm wire
 

Preparations for the STS-71 mission continue; the external tank will
be mated to the solid boosters next week, and the Orbiter Docking
System and Spacelab module are ready to be installed in the cargo bay
of Atlantis.

Mir
---

Progress M-26 docked with the Kvant port on Mir at 1821 UT on Feb 17. It
will remain at the station until shortly before the arrival of Soyuz
TM-21 in mid-March. Soyuz TM-21 carries the EO-18 crew. The commander is
the Russian Air Force cosmonaut Vladmir Dezhurov, on his first flight.
Flight engineer is experienced RKK Energiya cosmonaut Gennadiy
Strekalov, who flew on Soyuz T-3, which docked with the Salyut-6 space
station; Soyuz T-8, which failed to dock with Salyut-7; Soyuz T-11,
which did reach Salyut-7; and Soyuz TM-10 in 1990, which saw him
spending 130 days on Mir with Gennady Manakov. Strekalov was also on the
Soyuz launch of Sep 1983, when the launch escape system rocketed him and
Vladimir Titov (who flew on Discovery last month) clear of the launch
vehicle, which exploded on the pad. The third member of the EO-18 crew
is Dr. Norman Thagard, a NASA astronaut whose four previous missions 
were STS-7 (Challenger); STS 51-B/Spacelab 3 (Challenger); STS-30R/Magellan
(Atlantis); and STS-42/Spacelab IML-1 (Discovery). Launch of the Soyuz
is scheduled for Mar 14.

Thanks to Maxim Tarasenko and Asif Siddiqi for comments on the
annual launch list; I'll make a revised version available in a few weeks
by ftp.


Recent Launches
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Three Uragan class navigation satellites built by AKO Polyot were launched
on Mar 7 to become part of the Glonass system. According to the Russian
Space Forces, the satellites are Glonass numbers 765, 766 and 777.
The satellites are in 12-hour, 19000 km high orbits. Launch was by a
Proton-K with a Blok-DM2 upper stage.

Kosmos-2306 was launched on Mar 2 into a 94.5 min, 469 x 516 km x 65.8
deg orbit. It appears to be a calibration satellite of the Kosmos-816
type, which releases a series of small objects at intervals, to act as
calibration targets for the radars of the Space Forces or the Air
Defense. Four such objects were released on Mar 6. The previous mission
of this type to reach orbit was Kosmos-2075, which was launched in 1990
and reentered in 1992.

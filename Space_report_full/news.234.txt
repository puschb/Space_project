Shuttle
--------

Endeavour landed on the concrete Edwards runway 22 at 
2147:00 on 1995 Mar 18, ending the longest Shuttle mission yet.
Duration was 16 days 15 hr 8 min 47 sec. The deorbit burn
was at 2039:13 and lasted an unusually long 5 min 0 sec, placing
Endeavour in a 33 x 357 km descent orbit. OV-105's next flight
is STS-69 in the summer; first comes the Atlantis docking with
Mir and Discovery's deployment of a TDRS comsat.

The External Tank, ET-70, for mission STS-71 was mated to the solid
rocket boosters on Mar 16.

Mir
---

Soyuz TM-21 (spacecraft 11F732 no. 70) was launched at 0611:34 on 1995
Mar 14 carrying the EO-18 Mir crew, Vladimir Dezhurov, Gennadiy
Strekalov and Norman Thagard.  According to Vladimir Agapov, orbit
insertion and separation of the 7170 kg spaceship from the Blok-I third
stage was at 0620:23. Soyuz TM-21 entered an 88.61 min, 190 x 220 km x
51.65 deg orbit; (Note: this is based on a spherical Earth and the Space
Command elements; Agapov reports a 201 x 247 km orbit based on an oblate
Earth and Russian elements. I haven't attempted to reconcile the data.)
Two burns at 0946 and 1045 UTC raised the orbit to 89.89 min, 231 x 306
km. A small phasing burn was carried out the following day at 0709, and
then two final rendezvous burns raised the orbit to 92.43 min, 390 x 396
km, matching that of the Mir station.  Soyuz docked with Mir at 0745:26
UTC on Mar 16 and the crew entered Mir at around 0930.  Launch of  TM-21
meant that there were 13 people in space at once for the first time
ever: Dezhurov, Strekalov, Thagard on Soyuz; Viktorenko, Kondakova and
Polyakov on Mir; and Oswald, Gregory, Lawrence, Jernigan, Grunsfeld,
Parise, and Durrance on Endeavour.

The Soyuz TM spaceship is made up of three sections:  the
priborno-agregatniy otsek (service-equipment module), 3057 kg, which
contains the engine and carries the solar panel wings; the spuskaemiy
apparat (descent vehicle), 2835 kg, with heat shield, command and
control cabin, and the three cosmonaut couches; and the bitovoi otsek
(living module) of 1278 kg with the docking unit. Thagard is the
first American to be launched in a Soyuz, although the ASTP crew
flew in one while their Apollo craft was docked to it in 1975.
Soyuz TM-21 was launched by the Soyuz-U2 (11A511U2) variant of 
Energiya's standard R-7 based launch vehicle.

The Progress M-26 cargo craft undocked on Mar 15 at 0226:38
and deorbited itself over the Pacific at 0528 UT.

Recent Launches
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Japan's NASDA space agency launched the third H-II launch vehicle from
Tanegashima on Mar 17. Launch was at 2001 UTC; the first stage flew a
suborbital trajectory, and the LE-5A second stage completed its first
burn to enter a  322 x 336 km x 28.5 deg orbit, deploying the SFU (Space
Flyer Unit) satellite at 2014. The LE-5A then ignited again to enter
geostationary transfer orbit, and at 2028 the second payload,
Geostationary Meteorological Satellite 5, separated into a 329 x 36669 x
28.5 deg orbit.

The SFU will carry out materials processing, technology and astronomy
experiments, and will be retrieved by the STS-72 mission in December. It
carries the 0.15m liquid helium cooled IR Telescope in Space (IRTS),
with near and mid infrared spectrometers; a biology experiment studying
salamander eggs; an electron density experiment; materials  processing
furnaces; and technology experiments with solar arrays and an electric
thruster. It also carries an experimental platform to test technology
for the JEM Exposed Facility planned for the Space Station, and as such
it is the first flight element of Japan's Station program.

GMS-5 carries a Star 27 solid motor which is intended to place it in
geostationary orbit. The satellite has visible and IR radiometers
and will continue the Japanese Meteorological Agency's operational
weather satellite system.

Foton 10 landed on Mar 3, 135 km SE of Orenburg in Russia. The descent cabin
was later severely damaged when it was dropped from the helicopter carrying
it back for deintegration; many of the experiments were destroyed.

Telemetry has been received from the Clementine probe in solar orbit,
last heard from in Jul 1994. Further attempts will be made to restore
comms with the probe.

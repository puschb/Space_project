Shuttle
-------

Endeavour was at Edwards AFB late last week being prepared for
its trip home to Kennedy Space Center.

Mir
---

The Soyuz TM-20 spaceship landed 22 km northeast of Arkalyk in
Kazakhstan at 0404 UT on 1995 Mar 22. It carried cosmonauts Viktorenko,
Kondakova and Polyakov home from the Mir complex. Soyuz TM-20 was
launched on 1994 Oct 3 with Viktorenko, Kondakova and Merbold, and its
flight duration was 169 days 5 hr 22 min. Kondakova's 169 day flight
beats the previous womens' space duration record of  14 days set last
year by Japan's Chiaki Mukai and the previous career total of 34 days
held by NASA's Shannon Lucid. Viktorenko now has a career total of 489
days, making him the third most experienced space traveller in terms of
flight hours. But Valeriy Polyakov, who had been aboard Mir as station
doctor since Jan 1994, beats all records with a flight lasting 437 days
17 hr 59 min and a career total of 678 days 16 hr 34 min.

The EO-18 crew (callsign 'Uragan' or "Hurricane") of Vladimir Dezhurov,
Gennadiy Strekalov and Norman Thagard continue work aboard the Mir
complex. The Soyuz TM-21 ship is docked to the rear port; the Progress
M-27 (No. 227) cargo ferry is being prepared for launch next month.
The launch schedule for the Spektr module is being revised.

Recent Launches
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kosmos-2310, launched Mar 22 into a 105.02 min, 980 x 1010 km x 82.9 deg
orbit from Plesetsk, is a Parus type navigation satellite for the Russian
Navy. The Parus satellites are built by PO Polyot of Omsk.

Kosmos-2311, launched Mar 22 from Plesetsk into a 89.54 min, 169 x 334
km x 67.1 deg orbit, is a Yantar' class reconnaissance satellite. It is
expected to remain in service for a little over two months.

Erratum: I didn't spot the "PM" in the NASDA news release; launch
time of the H-II was 0801 on Mar 18, not 12 hours earlier as I reported last
issue.

GMS-5 has been renamed Himawari ("Sunflower") 5. The apogee motor fired
at 0054 UTC on Mar 19 and separated, leaving GMS-5 drifting at the
geostationary altitude. Meanwhile, SFU raised its orbit at 0549 on Mar
23 from 365 x 395 km x 28.5 deg to its operational height of 467 x 496
km.

Shuttle
-------

Endeavour arrived at Kennedy Space Center on Mar 27
and is now being prepared for the STS-69 flight.
Launch of the Spektr module to Mir will be delayed, and
this may delay the planned launch of Atlantis in June.


Recent Launches
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The last Atlas E was launched on Mar 24 from Space Launch Complex 3-West
at Vandenberg Air Force Base in California. The Atlas E launch vehicles
were refurbished intercontinental ballistic missiles which had been
built in the early 1960s. Atlas 45E carried an Air Force DMSP (Defense
Meteorological Satellite Program) satellite into space. The DMSP's Star
37S solid motor fired to insert the satellite in a 101.9 min, 846 x 854
km x 98.8 deg orbit. It is one of the Block 5D-2 series; all DMSP
satellites were built by RCA Astro Space, which is now Lockheed Martin
Astro Space. The satellite carries the OLS (Operational Linescan System)
weather imager, and a set of microwave sounders and particle
detectors. The satellite is 5D F-13 (the 13th flight satellite of
the Block 5D class), and is also designated DMSP 24547 (probably,
I haven't got confirmation of this). The 24547 designation says that
this is the 24th Block 5 satellite to be launched, and is spacecraft
construction number 47 (these last two digits do not necessarily
reflect the launch order). 

Three satellites were lost when a Russian launch vehicle fell in the Sea
of Okhotsk on Mar 28. The five-stage Start launch vehicle, which took
off from Plesetsk, is based on the Nadiradze bureau's three stage Topol'
ballistic missile. A four stage Start-1 variant  successfully placed a
test satellite in orbit in Mar 1993. This time, although the basic four
stages worked fine, the new fifth stage failed and the payloads did not
reach orbit.

The two commercial payloads on the Start were Gurwin-1 and UNAMSAT.
The Start also carried a prototype satellite, the EKA
(Eksperimental'niy Kosmicheskiy Apparat). Gurwin-1, also known as Techsat,
was built by the Technion Institute of Technology in  Israel.
The 50 kg satellite carried a CCD camera, a radiation detector,
an ozone monitor, and an amateur radio packet BBS as well as satellite
technology tests.  UNAMSAT was an AMSAT Microsat class amateur radio
satellite built by UNAM, the Autonomous University of Mexico. 

The Ariane launch vehicle returned to flight on Mar 28, following a
failure last December. It successfully placed in geostationary transfer
orbit two communications satellites, Eutelsat Hot Bird 1 and Brasilsat
B2. Hot Bird 1, an Aerospatiale-built Spacebus 2000 satellite,
is also known as Eutelsat II F-6. It was enhanced from the standard
Eutelsat II configuration to carry extra Ku band transponders.
Eutelsat satellites are owned by the European Telecommunications Satellite
Organization and broadcast TV to Europe and the Mediterranean.
Brasilsat B2 is owned by Embratel, the Brazilian government telephone
company. It is the second HS-376W, a wide diameter variant of the
classic Hughes HS-376 comsat in use since 1980. 

The new generation Zenit-launched spy satellite Kosmos-2290 was launched
on 1994 Aug 26. In late March of this year (between Mar 24 and 29) it
raised its apogee by 200 km, from an orbit of 181 x 382 km x 64.8 deg to
181 x 571 km x 64.8 deg, and four new small objects were tracked in the
post-manouevre orbit. It seems likely that this marks the end of the
Kosmos-2290 mission. Russian spy satellites are usually deorbited at the
end of their mission, and it is not clear whether the orbit raise of
Kosmos-2290 reflects a new operational regime, a new disposal strategy, 
a deorbit burn that went in the wrong direction, or (less likely) a
tracking by US Space Command of a residual part of the spacecraft
following recovery of a reentry vehicle.

There was another launch on Apr 3, but I don't have any details yet.

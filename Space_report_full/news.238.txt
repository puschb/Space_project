Shuttle
-------

Atlantis was rolled to the VAB on Apr 20 and was mated with the external
tank and SRBs on Apr 21. Launch is to be no earlier than Jun 19.
Atlantis should be on pad 39A by Apr 26; Discovery could
be on pad 39B by May 11. 

The SCA 905 carrier aircraft returned Columbia to Kennedy Space
Center on Apr 14. It was stored in Vehicle Assembly Building Bay 2 pending
availability of a parking space in the Orbiter Processing Facility.
On Apr 21 it was towed to OPF Bay 3 after that bay was vacated by
Atlantis.


Mir
---

The docking time of Progress M-27 was 2100 UT on Apr 11, not 2300 UT as
I reported last week. Included in Progress M-27's cargo was a small
geodetic satellite built by Kayser-Threde for the Geoforschungszentrum
Potsdam, Germany. GFZ-1 is a 21 cm diameter, 20 kg sphere covered with
laser retroreflectors. It was ejected from Mir's science airlock on Apr
19 and given the international designation 1986-17JE. I don't have the
time of ejection yet. GFZ-1's orbit was 92.34 min, 383 x 394 km x 51.6
deg on Apr 20. 

Recent Launches
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ESA's ERS-2 Earth Resources Satellite was launched on Apr 21 by Ariane
flight V72. The spacecraft, built by Dornier for the European Space
Agency, will be operated in tandem with ERS-1. It is based on Matra's
SPOT bus, and carries a hydrazine engine for precise orbit control.
ERS-2 has a 10-m long SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) for C-band radar
imaging of the Earth. Its primary mission is to study the sea surface
and polar ice. The SAR is linked to an Active Microwave Imager
instrument; also carried are a radar altimeter for wave heights, the
ATSR Along Track Scanning Radiometer for sea surface  temperatures, and
the PRARE orbit determination experiment. These are all similar to
experiments aboard ERS-1; ERS-2 also carries a new GOME global ozone
monitoring experiment. ERS-2 entered a 100.56 min, 783 x 786 km x 98.6
deg orbit.

According to Michelle Lyle of Arianespace, this V72 launch and
the preceding V71 launch both used the H-10+ third stage.
An enhanced third stage, the H-10-3, was first used on V70 and will
be phased in to eventually replace the H-10+. The Ariane is usually
flown to geostationary transfer orbit; flights to sun-synchronous
orbits are rarer, and usually carry secondary microsatellite payloads.
No secondary payloads were carried on this latest mission.

Geostationary satellite movements
---------------------------------

EUTELSAT's Hot Bird 1 satellite has been on station at 12.5 deg E since
Apr 9. Brasilsat B2, launched on the same Ariane flight, reached its
60.9 deg W station on Apr 7. 

Intelsat 705 is now at 56 deg W. Meanwhile, during April Intelsat 507 left 
its GEO position at 56.5 deg E and by Apr 21 was at 48E drifting 0.2 deg
per day W.

The AMSC-1 mobile communications satellite has reached geostationary
altitude. On Apr 11 it raised its orbit from 367 x 40142 km x 25.6 deg
to 10064 x 40165 km x 9.0 deg. By Apr 16 the orbit was 35666x  40110 km
x  0.92 deg, and by Apr 19 it was circularized at 35759 x 35797 km x 0.1
deg, drifting 0.1 deg per day eastward over 102 deg W.

Shuttle
-------

Launch of STS-70 has been delayed until after the Mir docking flight
(STS-71). Woodpeckers pecked holes in the external tank's spray-on foam
insulation. STS-70 will be rolled back to the VAB this week for repairs.
Launch of the STS-71 mission is now scheduled for Jun 22. The mission
commander is Robert 'Hoot' Gibson, chief of the Astronaut Office. The
pilot is Charles Precourt, and the three mission specialists are Ellen
Baker, Greg Harbaugh and Bonnie Dunbar. All have flown in space before.
Atlantis will also carry into orbit the Mir EO-19 crew, commander
Anatoliy Solov'yov and flight engineer Nikolai Budarin. Solov'yov, a
Russian born in Latvia, has made three spaceflights, commanding Soyuz
TM-5, TM-9 and TM-15, for a total of over a year in space. Budarin is a
rookie.

In response to readers' requests, here is the full list of  space
travellers who changed their names before flying: Vladimir Krysin (Dzhanibekov),
Georgiy Kakalov (Ivanov), Shannon Wells (Lucid), Anna Tingle (Fisher),
Millie Hughes (Hughes-Fulford),   Ellen Shulman (Baker), Kathryn Cordell
(Thornton), Nancy Decker (Sherlock, Currie), Chiaki Naito (Mukai). Mike
Cassutt says that Rich Clifford's birth name is probably Uram, but I don't
have confirmation of this.

Mir
---

It's been a busy couple of weeks at the Mir complex. On May 22, the Mir
complex had the Kvant module docked at the rear (+X) port, and the
Progress M-27 cargo ship docked at the front, -X (containing docking
cone no. 1). There are four more ports at the front of Mir, +Y, -Y, +Z,
-Z, which share a single docking cone (no 2) which is needed each time a
docking is made. The Kvant-2 TsM-D module is docked at +Y, and the
Kristall TsM-T module was attached at -Y with cone no 2. On May 17 the
cosmonauts had transferred one of the  solar arrays from Kristall to the
Kvant (TsM-e) module at the other end of the station using the Strela
crane. Dezhurov and Strekalov carried out EVA-3 on May 22, completing
the attachment of one the Kristall solar array to the Kvant module and
rolling up the other one on Kristall so it doesn't get in the way. 

On May 23 the Progress M-27 cargo ship undocked from the -X port and was
deorbited. Then on May 26 Kristall was rotated from the -Y to the -X
port.  On May 28 the cosmonauts carried out a 21 min EVA to move cone
no. 2 from the -Y to the -Z ports, allowing Kristall to be moved to -Z
on May 30. Next, the Spektr module, which was launched on May 20, docked
with the station at -X at around 0056 on Jun 1. Dezhurov and Strekalov
went outside again for 23 minutes to move cone 2 again, back to the -Y
port. Spektr was due to be rotated into the -Y slot on June 3.

The plan is for  the transfer of Kristall from -Z
to -X on June 7. All will then be ready for the docking of Atlantis with
Kristall, which has to be at the -X position so that Atlantis doesn't
bump into the solar panels from the other modules. After the STS-71
flight, Kristall goes back to -Z. Later in the year, STS-74 will
deliver the SM (Stikovochnoy Modul' or docking module) to be docked
to the Kristall shuttle port; this extension will let Atlantis dock
safely with Kristall in the -Z position, avoiding repeated reconfigurations.
At the end of the year, the final TsM-I (Priroda) module will dock at -X
and be rotated to the remaining port, +Z. The following year, if
Atlantis is docked at the same time as both a Soyuz and a Progress
there will be a total of seven modules plus three spaceships docked
together at once - not a bad space station.

Recent Launches
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Kosmos-2311 spy satellite completed its 70 day mission on May 31.

Kosmos-2312, an Oko early warning satellite, was launched on May 24. The
satellite and Blok-L upper stage were placed in a 213 x 518 km x 62.8
deg parking orbit; the Blok-L fired to place Kosmos-2312 in a 12 hr, 602
x 39274 km x 62.9 deg orbit. The Oko satellites are built by NPO
Lavochkin.

Lockheed Martin chalked up two Atlas launch successes in 8 days with the
launch of the GOES J weather satellite and the UHF Followon F5 comsat.
First up was GOES J (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite J),
which became GOES 9 on orbit. The satellite, built by Space Systems/Loral,
is the second in the GOES Next series and will be used by the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). GOES 9 was launched by
Atlas Centaur AC-77, an Atlas I class launch vehicle at 0552 on May 23.
The Centaur first burn was at 0557, and the second burn at 0616.
At 0621 the Centaur separated, leaving GOES 9 in a 206 x 42319 km x 27.5 deg
transfer orbit. On May 27, perigee was raised to 10928 km and inclination
lowered to 8 deg, and on May 29 perigee was raised again to
35622 km. On May 31 the spacecraft was in a 35614 x 42419 km x 0.29 deg
orbit, at 91 deg West drifting 1.5 deg west per hour.

The UHF Followon F5 comsat, also known as EHF F5, was launched on May
31. The satellite is an HS-601 class, built by Hughes. It will be used
by the US Navy for communications. The Atlas II Centaur launch vehicle,
AC-116, took off from pad 36A at 1527 UT on May 31. The Centaur ignited
at 1532 as the Atlas fell away, and entered parking orbit at 1538:52.
The engine restarted at 1550 UT to place the HS-601 satellite in
geostationary transfer orbit. The orbit was 293 x 27133 km x 27.0 deg;
the low apogee  was deliberate, and will be increased by firings of the
HS-601's onboard liquid propellant engine. Note the difference between
this and the GOES 9 transfer orbit, whose apogee is higher than
synchronous altitude; the replacement of solid apogee motors with the
more flexible liquid ones during the 1980s has led to a wide variety of
strategies for delivering payloads to geostationary orbit.

TDRS 3 drifted past 96E on May 23
AMSC 1 is now on station, at 101.0W
Intelsat 706 went on station at 55.9W around June 1.

After undocking from Mir on Jul 4, Atlantis spent several days on orbit,
carrying out medical research work with the Spacelab-Mir
module in the cargo bay. On Jul 5 Atlantis was in a 92.44 min, 390 x 398 km
x 51.65 deg orbit. The orbit of Mir was 92.47 min, 393 x 398 km. 

The payload bay doors were closed in preparation for the deorbit burn on
Jul 7 at 1211 UTC (scheduled), and at 1345 UTC the OMS engines ignited
for the 3h 32s deorbit burn. Atlantis reached the nominal entry
interface with the atmosphere at 1422. The landing gear was lowered at
1454:21 UTC, and main gear touchdown on runway 15 at the Kennedy Space
Center was at 1454:36 UTC. The drag chute was deployed at 1454:39, with
nose gear touchdown at 1454:44. Atlantis rolled down RW15, releasing the
chute at 1455:10 and coming to a stop at 1455:27.

The Atlantis flight duration (launch to main gear touchdown) was 9 days
19 h 22 min 15s. The Mir EO-18 crew spent 114 days, 8 h 43 min in space,
setting a US record for Norm Thagard. Career totals for the astronauts
of both crews:
 Gibson     868 h 18m (5 flights)
 Precourt   475 h 02m (2 flights)
 Baker      686 h 31m (3 flights)
 Harbaugh   578 h 22m (3 flights)
 Dunbar     996 h 37m (4 flights)
 Dezhurov  2744 h 43 m (1 flight)
 Strekalov 6430 h 21 m (5 flights)
 Thagard   3349 h 27 m (5 flights)

The previous US record was 2017h 16m (Carr, Gibson, Pogue)
and the previous career record for currently active US astronauts
was Story Musgrave's 858 h 6m, now surpassed by both Dunbar and Thagard.
Of course, the world record is held by Valeriy Polyakov with 16288 hr 34m.

As Atlantis sits on the runway at Kennedy Space Center, Discovery
and Endeavour are on pads 39B and 39A ready for the STS-70 and
STS-69 missions in July and August. Endeavour was rolled out to the
pad on Jul 6.

Obituary
--------

Georgiy Timofeevich Beregovoy died on 1995 Jun 30 at the age of 74.
Beregovoy, born in the Ukraine on 15 Apr 1921, was a World War II pilot
and later a test pilot. In 1964 he joined the Soviet Air Force cosmonaut
detachment as a late addition to the 1963 group which included 
younger pilots such as Shatalov and Filipchenko. Beregovoy trained on
a backup crew for the cancelled Voskhod-3 mission, and in 1968
flew into space to test-fly the Soyuz spaceship after the fatal
1967 accident which resulted in the death of Komarov. Beregovoy's
Soyuz-3 carried out a rendezvous with the automated Soyuz-2 but was
unable to dock with it. Beregovoy left flight status in 1969 but
remained attached to the cosmonaut training team until his retirement
in 1987. [Thanks to Jim Oberg for passing on news of Beregovoy's death.]

Recent Launches
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Russian launched a Tsikada class navigation satellite on Jul 5 from Plesetsk
into a 104.7 min, 959 x 1004 km x 82.9 deg orbit. The Tsikada satellites
are built by PO Polyot of Omsk. Satellites of this
type have been named in the Kosmos, Tsikada, and Nadezhda at various times;
this one is probably Nadezhda, the subtype that carries a COSPAS/SARSAT
search and rescue transponder. It was launched into orbital plane 11.
Recent launches into each of the Tsikada system orbital planes are:

 Plane 11           Plane 12           Plane 13           Plane 14

 Nadezhda    (7/89) Kosmos-1861 (6/87) Kosmos-2123 (2/91) Nadezhda (2/90)
 Kosmos-2181 (3/92)  (+RS-10/RS-11)     (+RS-12/RS-13)    Nadezhda (7/94)
 Kosmos-2230 (1/93) Nadezhda    (3/91) Tsikada     (1/95)
 Nadezhda?   (7/95)

The Kosmos-2314 spy satellite raised its orbit from 164 x 328 km x 67.1 deg
to 168 x 350 km x 67.1 deg on Jul 3. Such orbit raising maneuvers
are carried out several times during the mission for satellites of this
class.


Ariane V75 was launched at 1623 UTC on Jul 7 from Kourou, and launched the
first European spy satellite, Helios 1A. Matra Marconi Space's 
2537 kg Helios 1A is based on the SPOT remote sensing satellite bus.
It was originally going to be a purely French satellite, but
Spain and Italy have joined the program. The Ariane 40 launch vehicle
also carried an ASAP (Ariane Structure for Auxiliary Payloads)
with two microsatellites, CERISE and UPMSAT 1. 
CERISE is a 50 kg satellite built by Alcatel Espace for the 
French civil space agency CNES and the Delegation General de l'Armament
(DGA) of the French defense ministry. CERISE is a technology precursor
for French electronic intelligence satellites and is based on 
Surrey Satellite Technology's UOSAT bus. UPMSAT 1 is a small 47
kg satellite for microgravity and telecommunications research
built by the Polytechnic University of Madrid. (Does anyone know
if this is also a UOSAT bus?)

The DC-X made its seventh flight on Jul 7.

Geostationary Satellite Movements
---------------------------------

1982-110B, The SBS 3 satellite, launched in 1982 and previously at
 74.0W, was moved out of geostationary orbit on about Jun 2.
1988-91B, TDRS 3 is on station at 84.8E.
1995-27A, UHF F5 was at 173.0W drifting 0.05 deg W per day on Jul 1.
1986-26B, Brasilsat 2 moved out of geostationary orbit at 65W 
 in early June and is now drifting W at 0.3 deg per day.

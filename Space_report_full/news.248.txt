Navette
-------

STS-70 was launched at 1341:55 UTC on Jul 13. A hold was called at T-31s
(just before transition to RSLS computer control) when one of the flight
controllers noticed that the signal monitored by range safety destruct
radio recievers on the External Tank was fluctuating, but within a
minute he had fixed the problem and the Shuttle was cleared to continue
counting down from the T-31s mark with no recycle required. This was the
shortest time between landing of the previous mission and launch of a
new one - only 6 days. The previous  record between landing and next
launch for Shuttle missions was STS-55 in 1993, which followed the
STS-56 landing by 9 days.

The Solid Rocket Boosters (RSRM-44) separated at around 1343:58, and the
three main engines (including the new Block I upgrade engine) continued
burning successfully until main engine cutoff (MECO) around 1350:30 UTC.
The external tank (ET-71) separated, leaving Discovery in a 67 x 291 km
x 28.5 deg transfer orbit. The OMS 2 circularization burn was carried out
at 1424 UTC, putting Discovery in a 90.6 min, 301 x 302 km x 28.5 deg orbit,
and the payload bay doors were due to be opened at
1509 UTC. The TDRS-G satellite payload was deployed at 1955 UTC.
At around 2009 the OMS engines were fired to separate from the vicinity
of TDRS, putting OV-103 in a 90.85 min, 299 x 333 km x 28.5 deg orbit.

Crew of STS-70 are Col. Tom Henricks, USAF (Commander); Kevin Kregel
(Pilot); and mission specialists  Maj. Nancy Currie, US Army, Dr. Donald
Thomas, and Dr. Mary Weber.

Atlantis was towed to the Orbiter Processing Facility Bay 2
on Jul 7 following its landing at Kennedy Space Center.
Its next mission is STS-74.

Station Orbitale Mir
---

The EO-19 crew of Solov'yov and Budarin have settled in on the Mir
station and are awaiting the launch of a Progress M supply craft.

It turns out that RKK Energia's 316GK docking module planned for launch
on STS-74 is a lengthened Soyuz BO (Bitovoy Otsek - Habitable Module or
orbital module), with a central cylindrical section added and two
APAS-89 docking units added on each end. Thanks to David Anderman and
Maxim Tarasenko for clearing this up.

Erreur
---------

Of course, the 3h 32s deorbit burn of Atlantis (JSR 247) should have
read 3min 32s!

Lancements recents
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A Titan 4 Centaur was launched from Cape Canaveral on Jul 10.
The rocket used was Titan 45K-19 with the Centaur TC-8 upper stage.
According to John Pike, the rocket had the large (86 foot) payload shroud.
It was observed to head towards a high inclination orbit and it may
be assumed to be another satellite like USA 103 last year, an advanced
signals intelligence satellite intended for a Molniya-like orbit.

The Galileo Probe separated from the Orbiter at 0530 UTC on Jul 13. It
will  remain powered down for the coast to Jupiter, and will be awakened
when its accelerometers detect braking due to entry in Jupiter's
atmosphere. The Galileo Orbiter will fire its engine for a deflection
maneuver on Jul 27.

The modified Tsikada class navigation satellite launched on Jul 5 from
LC 132 Pad 1 at Plesetsk was named Kosmos-2315.  According to Maxim
Tarasenko, it carries an additional Kurs transponder. The modified
satellite may possibly have the designation Nadezhda-M.

TDRS-G, attached to Inertial Upper Stage IUS-26, was deployed from
Space Shuttle Discovery on Jul 13 at 1955 UTC. The IUS SRM-1 solid
rocket motor burn was at 2055 UTC, placing the TDRS and IUS SRM-2
in transfer orbit. At around 0230 UTC on Jul 14 the SRM-2 ignited
to place TDRS-G, now renamed TDRS-7, in a geosynchronous drift orbit.

Satellites geostationnaires
---------------------------------

1995-23A (Intelsat 706) is drifting E from its previous 56W position.

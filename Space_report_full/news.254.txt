Shuttle
-------

Launch date for Endeavour on mission STS-69 has been set for Aug 31.
Crew of Endeavour/STS-69 are David Walker (Commander), Ken Cockrell (Pilot),
James Voss (Payload Commander), James Newman (Mission Specialist),
and Michael Gernhardt (Mission Specialist). The flight will
see the deployment and retrieval of the Wake Shield Facility
microgravity processing satellite and the Spartan-201 ultraviolet
solar observatory, as well as a spacewalk by Voss and Gernhardt
to test new equipment and techniques, and operation of the
International Extreme Ultraviolet Hitchhiker (IEH-1) and the Capillary
Pumped Loop Hitchhiker/GAS Bridge Assembly experiment payloads
in the cargo bay.

Meanwhile, Columbia has been moved to the Vehicle Assembly Building
and mated with the STS-73 stack.

Mir
----

Can anyone forward me details of a reported EVA on Mir on Aug 18? (It's
mentioned on Ron Baalke's Space Calendar). I haven't been able to
confirm it.

Recent Launches
--------------

JCSAT 3 is a Hughes HS-601 model communications satellite
owned by JSAT (Japan Satellite Systems). JSAT was formed in
1993 by the merger of Japan Communications Satellite Co (JCSAT,
which operated the first two JCSAT satellites) and Satellite
Japan Corp (SAJAC). JCSAT 1 and 2 are HS-393 spin-stabilized
satellites launched in 1989-90 and still operating.

JCSAT 3 was launched on a Lockheed Martin Atlas 2AS on
1995 Aug 29. The Atlas first stage was serial 8205, with Centaur AC-117
as the second stage. Launch was from pad 36B at Cape Canaveral.
JCSAT 3 is the first Japanese digital TV broadcasting
satellite, and programming will be operated  by DMC (Digital
Multi-Channel Planning Co, Ltd), a partnership of JSAT, Itochu Corp,
Mitsui and Co, Ltd, Nissho Iwai Corp and Sumitomo Corp. The satellite
will also provide data and fax transmission services. The hybrid
3-axis stabilized payload has 28 Ku band and 12 C band transponders.

The Atlas IIAS launch vehicle placed JCSAT 3 in a supersynchronous
transfer orbit. The higher the apogee, the less velocity change
needed to change the orbital plane and reach geostationary orbit, and
the Atlas placed JCSAT in an orbit which was even more favorable
than anticipated. (I don't have the parameters yet). 

The `N-STAR a' satellite (yes, the lower case letter a is, perversely,
correct) is an FS-1300 class Space Systems/Loral satellite built for
Nippon Telephone and Telegraph (NTT) of Japan. N-STAR a was launched
1995 Aug 29 on the V77 flight of Ariane, using an Ariane 44P with an
H-10 III third stage and the 01 fairing. The launch profile used a
standard geostationary transfer orbit. N-STAR a is to replace the CS-3
satellite at 132E. The satellite was damaged during transportation from
California to Guiane, and several weeks were needed for repairs. The
N-STAR a satellite has a launch mass of 3410 kg, a dry mass of 1617 kg,
and a BOL mass of 2057 kg. The 3-axis stabilized satellite has a solar
panel span of 27.3m, and a bus size of 2.4 x 2.2 x 2.2 m. Height is 6.3
m including the payload mast. Mass of the third stage in orbit with the
VEB is 2065 kg at orbit insertion, or 1770 kg after fuel depletion (1240
kg H-10-3, 530 kg VEB). The payload includes 11 Ka-band and 8 Ku-band
transponders for telephone relay, 5 C-band transponders for
communications to remote islands,  and an S-band transponder for mobile
communications. (source: Av Week, Arianespace)

In a third success for Japan this week, a small TR-1A suborbital
sounding rocket was successfully launched from Tanegashima on Aug 25.

The IABS final stage of the DSCS III B7 launch has now been cataloged as
object 23648.

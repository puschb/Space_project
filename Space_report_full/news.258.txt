Note
----

The second edition of my on-line version of the UN Registry of Space
Objects is now available at 
  http://hea-www.harvard.edu/QEDT/jcm/space/un/un.html
It contains the data given by member states to the UN about their
launchings; readers should beware that this data is often incomplete
and the document should not be used as a principal source of launch
information.

Shuttle
-------

Launch of Mission STS-73 on Sep 28 was scrubbed at 0800 UTC on Sep 28,
at T-3h, due to a hydrogen leak. Orbiter Columbia carries the Spacelab
Long Module, with transfer tunnel and tunnel airlock adapter. The module
being used is probably Long Module Flight Unit 1, last flown on the
IML-2 mission in 1994. This time the mission is designated US
Microgravity Lab 2. There is one other payload in the cargo bay, the
small Orbital Acceleration Research Experiment accelerometer attached to
an Adaptive Payload Carrier (I think) on the cargo bay wall. The next
launch attempt for STS-73 will be Oct 5.

Orbiter OV-103 Discovery has arrived in Palmdale aboard one of the
Shuttle Carrier Aircraft (905 or 911, as usual I'd like someone to tell
me which!). It will remain there for about a year for refurbishment.

Mir
----

Launch of the Progress M-29 cargo ship is scheduled for Oct 8.

Recent Launches
--------------

The Telstar 402R satellite was launched on Sep 24. Telstar 402R is a
Lockheed Martin Astro Space Series 7000 communications satellite built
for AT&T. It replaces the Telstar 402  satellite which exploded shortly
after orbit insertion in Sep 1994. Telstar 402R is a hybrid C/Ku band
comsat and will be stationed at 89 deg W for US domestic communications.
The satellite has successfully reached geostationary altitude and is
drifting towards its initial location.

The Russian Space Agency's Resurs-F2 recoverable remote sensing satellite
was launched on Sep 26. The satellite, built by KB Foton of Samara, Russia,
is based on the Vostok spacecraft. Vladimir Agapov reports that this
is the final Resurs-F mission. It is in a 230 x 233 km x 82.3 deg orbit.
The Resurs-F satellites carry cameras which are returned to Earth with their
film cassettes in a reentry vehicle at the end of the mission.

An advanced generation recon satellite, Kosmos-2320, was launched by
Soyuz from Baykonur on Sep 29 into a 179 x 284 km x 64.9 deg orbit.
It probably raised its perigee on Sep 30 but I don't have the orbital
data yet.

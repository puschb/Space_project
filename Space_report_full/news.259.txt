Shuttle
-------

The next launch attempt for Columbia/STS-73 will be no earlier than Oct 14. The
Oct 5 schedule was slipped a day due to Hurricane Opal and then scrubbed
on Oct 6 prior to the start of fuelling  because of problems with the
Orbiter landing gear. The Oct 7 attempt was scrubbed at the T-20min mark
due to failure of one of the Master Events Controller avionics boxes.

Meanwhile, Atlantis was rolled to the VAB on Oct 3 for connection to the
STS-74 stack.

Discovery was ferried to Palmdale by the NASA 905 SCA aircraft. It
arrived in Palmdale on Sep 28 after stopping at Fort Worth Naval Air Station 
and Salt Lake City. (Thanks to Ed Dietz for info). It will remain
at the Rockwell plant for refurbishment until its next mission in 1997.

Mir
----

The Progress M-29 cargo ship (factory serial number 229) was launched
successfully from pad 1 at Baykonur on Oct 8 at 1850:40 UTC. According
to V. Agapov, it was inserted into a 194 x 242 km x 51.7 deg orbit.
Progress M-29 will dock at the rear of the Kvant module; Soyuz TM-22
is docked to the front port of the Mir transfer module. The EO-20
crew of Gidzenko, Avdeev and Reiter had been in space for 36 days
as of Oct 9.

Recent Launches
--------------

Kosmos-2321 was launched at 0323 UTC on Oct 6 from Plesetsk by a
Kosmos-3M launch vehicle into a 95.13 minute, 246 x 802 km x 82.9 deg
orbit. The spacecraft is probably a radar calibration satellite, which
are launched on Kosmos-3M rockets into low elliptical orbits, although
this particular orbit has not been used before. Another, less likely,
possibility is that it was a Parus navigation satellite intended for a 1000 km
circular orbit but which suffered an upper stage failure; Phil Clark has
also suggested this as an interpretation, and reports that the orbital
plane is the same as Kosmos-2266.

Kosmos-2320 raised its orbit to 239 x 300 km x 64.9 deg by Oct 1. The
orbit indicates it is a member of the Kosmos-1426 group of long-lived
recon satellites. The other member of the group in orbit is Kosmos-2305,
launched in Dec 1994 and currently in a 229 x 281 km x 64.9 deg orbit.
The other types of imaging recon satellite currently in use by the
Russian Ministry of Defence are the Yantar'-class vehicle, most recently
flown as Kosmos-2311 and Kosmos-2314, with two month lifetimes and lower
perigees,  and the new Kosmos-2290 class satellite launched on Zenit
vehicles. Kosmos-2290 flew for a year in Apr 1994-Apr 1995 and has not
yet been replaced.

AT&T's Telstar 402R reached geostationary altitude by Sep 27 and arrived
on station at 89.1W around Oct 3. Other recent geostationary launches:
JCSAT 3 is at 127.5E, N-Star a is at 131.9E. Kosmos-2319 is at 79.8E,
probably replacing Kosmos-2291 which has moved from its 80 deg E location and
is drifting west at 2 deg per day. PAS 4 is at 68.5E on station;
Space Command data released in September showing it drifting were erroneous.

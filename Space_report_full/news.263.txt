Shuttle
-------

Columbia landed on runway 33 at Kennedy Space Center on Nov 5 at 1145:21
UTC (main gear touchdown) after successfully completing the 15 d 21h 52m
US Microgravity Lab 2 (STS-73) mission.  Its next mission is STS-75, the
Tethered Satellite reflight. OV-102 has now made 18 flights for a total
flight time of 4016 hr 34 min, easily more than any of the other
Orbiters. Bowersox and Thornton now have more flight time than any
active NASA astronauts except Thagard and Dunbar.

The next launch is STS-74/Atlantis, scheduled for Nov 11. Atlantis will
dock with the Mir space station, delivering the 316GK docking module and
supplies. Below I give the cargo bay manifest for Atlantis (my best
guess, those in the know please send corrections!). The payload area is
divided into 13 bays from forward (airlock) to aft (tail end). '6P'
means a payload attached to the port side wall of Bay 6. Side wall
payloads usually use either a GAS Beam Adapter (GABA) mounting plate or
the smaller APC (Adaptive Payload Carrier) mounting plate. 

STS-74 Cargo Bay Payloads:

-       Remote Manipulator System No. 301
Bay 1   Airlock Tunnel Adapter
Bay 3   Orbiter Docking System
Bay 11  316GK Docking Module

Bay 1P  APC with ITEPC radiation counter
Bay 3S  APC with TCS-1 laser rendezvous unit
Bay 4S  APC with TCS-2 laser rendezvous unit
Bay 5S  GABA with GLO-4 Hitchhiker experiment and avionics
Bay 6P  GABA with PASDE canister and Hitchhiker avionics
Bay 6S  APC with VHF communications system
Bay 7S  GABA with PASDE canister
Bay 13P GABA with PASDE canister
Bay 13S APC with IMAX Cargo Bay Camera

The GLO-4 experiment measures emission from airglow and
Shuttle-atmosphere interactions. PASDE is a collection of three pairs of
photgrammetric cameras which will image Mir solar arrays as those arrays
wobble in response to station operations; the data will be used to study
the structural properties of the arrays. The four GABA payloads are
collectively known as the GPP (GLO / PASDE Payload), managed as a
Hitchhiker-G payload under the Shuttle Small Payloads Program.

The Atlantis crew will remove the Docking Module from the payload bay
using the RMS arm, and dock one end of it to the Orbiter Docking System.
Then they will rendezvous with the Mir complex and dock the other end
with the Kristall module. After the mission, they will undock the ODS
from the Docking Module, leaving the Docking Module attached to Kristall
where it will accommodate future  Shuttle visits. The Docking Module
is built by RKK Energia and is a stretched Soyuz orbital module with
two APAS-type androgynous docking units.

Crew of STS-74 is Ken Cameron, James Halsell, Chris Hadfield, Jerry Ross
and William McArthur. Hadfield is a Canadian Space Agency astronaut.

Meanwhile, the external tank ET-75 for the STS-72 mission was due to be
mated to the RSRM-52 solid rocket motors in the VAB on Nov 9, but the
KSC Shuttle Status Reports always forget to tell us what's happening to the
other orbiters when a launch is imminent, so I don't know if that event
actually happened. Columbia has been towed back to Orbiter Processing
Facility Bay 2 and will be prepared for next year's STS-75 mission.

Mir
----

The crew of Gidzenko, Avdeev and Reiter continue work aboard the Mir
complex. The next major event is the arrival of the Space Shuttle
Atlantis with the new Docking Module. Marcia Smith reports that the EVA
on Oct 20 probably began at 1150 UT, not 1155 UT as I reported, and thus
the duration was 5h 16m.

Recent Launches
--------------

McDonnell Douglas' Delta 229 was launched from Space Launch Complex 2 at
Vandenberg AFB on Nov 4, placing the Canadian Space Agency's Radarsat
remote sensing spacecraft in orbit. The Delta was a two-stage model
7920-10. RADARSAT's primary payload is a synthetic aperture C-band radar
for imaging the Earth's surface. The radar is 15m long and 1.5m wide.
The 2750 kg spacecraft was launched into a 783 x 787 km x 98.6 deg polar
orbit.

Attached to the Delta 229 second stage in orbit is SURFSAT, a small
Caltech/JPL package to test deep space communications and orbital VLBI
radio astronomy transponders. The Deep Space Network 32 GHz Ka-band
transponders will be used to study atmospheric transmission problems at
those frequencies and the VLBI Ku and X-band transponders will do tests
of the ground system for Japan's VSOP and Russia's proposed Radioastron.
The SURFSAT package is part of the Summer Undergraduate Research
Fellowship Satellite project, built by Caltech undergraduates. The
SURFSAT spacecraft is reported to be working well. After releasing
Radarsat, Delta/Surfsat maneuvered into a 934 x 1494 km x 100.6 deg
orbit.

A Lockheed Martin Titan 4 Centaur was launched on Nov 6 from Cape
Canaveral. It placed in orbit the Milstar DFS 2 satellite, which is
scheduled to provide secure military communications from geostationary
orbit. Titan core vehicle K-21 placed the Centaur TC-13 stage in orbit.
Three Centaur burns were used to successively reach low earth parking
orbit, geostationary transfer orbit, and geosynchronous orbit. The
payload separated and was given the designation USA 115. Thrusters on
the Milstar will position the satellite at its geostationary location.
The Milstar satellite is built by the part of Lockheed Martin that was
formerly Lockheed. It is the second Block 1 Milstar, with a Low Data
Rate payload with EHF (44.5 GHz) uplink and SHF (20 GHz) downlink and
four UHF AFSATCOM transponders. The satellite also has a 60 GHz
crosslink to enable it to communicate with Milstar DFS 1, launched in
Feb 1994. The next Milstar will be the first Block 2, with a Medium Data
Rate payload of three times higher bit rate. (Payload info from Jane's
Space Directory).

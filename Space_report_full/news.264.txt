Mission STS-74 was launched at 12:30:43 UTC on 1995 Nov 12.
Atlantis left pad 39A on the second attempt; the Nov 11 attempt was
scrubbed at T-5min due to bad weather at the transatlantic abort sites.
On Nov 12, separation of the RSRM-51 solid rocket motors came at
12:32:47 (approx) and main engine cutoff (MECO) was at around 12:39:15,
followed by separation of external tank ET-74 a few seconds later.
The OMS-2 orbit circularization burn was successful at 1314 UTC
and the payload bay doors were opened at about 1400 UTC.
Atlantis was placed in a 300 x 339 km x 51.64 deg orbit with a
period of 90.92 min.

The RMS arm was used to grapple the 316GK Docking Module in the
payload bay at around 0546 UTC (scheduled) on Nov 14. The Docking
Module (DM) was due to be unberthed at 0621 UTC and moved over
the Orbiter Docking System (ODS) in the forward part of the payload bay.
At 0717 UT on Nov 14 the Docking Module was successfully connected
to the Orbiter Docking System as Atlantis fired thrusters to
slam the ODS into one of the DM's docking ports, docking the craft together.
At around 0900 UT the RMS arm released the DM, now connected to the ODS
by a tight seal.

Atlantis made an OMS burn at 0327 UTC on Nov 15 to begin the terminal
approach to Mir. It made rendezvous at a distance of 50m at 0528 UTC
(data from Bill Harwood). Atlantis remained at 50m until 0556 when it
resumed its approach, stopping again at 0618 at a distance of 10m. Final
approach from 10m began at 0622 and Atlantis docked with Mir at 0627:39
UTC on Nov 15. By 0636 the latches on the APDS docking system were
closed and the Docking Module was firmly attached to Kristall. The
hatches to Mir were opened at about 0900 UTC. Orbit of the Mir/Atlantis
complex is 391 x 394 km x 51.6 deg. Crew of the complex are: Yuriy
Gidzenko (Station commander, Russian Air Force),  Sergey Avdeev (Mir
Flight Engineer, RKK Energiya), Thomas Reiter (Mir Flight Engineer 2,
European Space Agency), Ken Cameron (Atlantis commander, NASA), James
Halsell (Atlantis pilot, NASA), Chris Hadfield (Mission specialist,
Canadian Space Agency), Jerry Ross (Mission Specialist, NASA), and
William McArthur  (Mission Specialist, NASA).


Recent Launches

The European Space Agency's Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) is in
orbit! In 1983, the IRAS satellite made the first survey of the far
infrared sky. Its liquid-helium cooled telescope operated for less than
a year, but it is still generating Ph.D. theses at a rapid rate -
perhaps one of the most striking examples of a single mission having a
profound influence on astronomy. Unlike IRAS, ISO will carry out pointed
observations at specific targets of interest instead of scanning the
entire sky. ISO's instruments are much more sophisticated - IRAS
measured the brightness of sources at four wavelengths while ISO will
return images and high resolution spectra over the entire infrared range
from 2.5 microns to 200 microns. Mass of ISO is 2498 kg at launch, 2418
kg at beginning of observations, and 1515 kg dry. There are four
instruments, the LWS and SWS long and short wavelength spectrometers,
and the ISOCAM and ISOPHOT camera and photometer systems. The liquid
helium cooled 60 cm telescope may operate for as much as a year and a
half. ISO was launched by an Ariane 44P from Kourou on Nov 17 into an
elliptical transfer orbit with a period of  24 hours 8.8 minutes, and an
altitude of 570 x 71498 km x 5.2 deg. Its on-board propulsion system
will synchronize the orbit with a 23-hour 56 minute sidereal period, but
unlike a communications satellite the orbit will be elliptical with an
apogee of 70000 km, taking it far from the radiation belts. The cover of
the cryogenic dewar will be ejected on Nov 28 launch and performance
verification observations are planned to begin around Dec 10.
Astronomers with time scheduled on ISO (including your eager
correspondent!) will have to wait until early next year before regular
observations begin.

The V80 flight of Ariane used a standard 44P vehicle, with an H-10-III
upper stage, but with the No. 02 type payload fairing. Launch was at 0120
UTC on Nov 12, with second stage burn at 0123 and third stage burn at
0125. The third stage shut down at 0138 and ISO separated at 0140 UTC.

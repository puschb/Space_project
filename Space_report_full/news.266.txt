Shuttle
-------

The next Shuttle mission is STS-72, scheduled for January. Endeavour
was moved to the Vehicle Assembly Building on Nov 30.

Interestingly, Space Command has not allocated a catalog number for the
putative 1995-61B, the Stikovochnoy Modul' (Russian Docking Module)
launched by Atlantis. This is a tricky issue - they continue to issue
separate orbital elements for rest of the various different modules
docked to Mir. But the SM never  flew independently, it was always
connected either to Atlantis or to Kristall. So should it get a
designation or not? 

Mir
---

Launch of the Progress M-30 cargo ferry is expected on December 15.

Recent Launches
--------------

Asiasat 2 was successfully launched by a Chang Zheng 2E rocket from the
Chinese spaceport at Xichang on Nov 28. The satellite will provide
communications services for the Hong Kong based company Asia Satellite
Telecommunications Co Ltd. It is a Lockheed Martin Astro Space Series
7000 comsat with 9 Ku-band and 24 C-band transponders. The CZ-2E second
stage entered a 187 x 292 km x 28.0 deg parking orbit, and separated
from the Asiasat and its  kick motor. The Chinese EPKM (FG-46) kick
motor, never flown before, fired to place Asiasat in a standard 220 x
35039 km x 25.6 deg transfer orbit.  Previous CZ-2E launches used
American-built Thiokol perigee motors. The liquid apogee motor (anyone
know what type?) will be fired later to station Asiasat 2 at 100 deg E.

The SOHO satellite was launched at 0808 UTC on Dec 2 by Atlas Centaur
AC-121. SOHO, the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, is a European
Space Agency science spacecraft developed in collaboration with NASA.
The Lockheed Martin Atlas IIAS took off from Pad 36 at Cape Canaveral;
the Centaur second stage made an initial burn to enter low parking
orbit of 175 x 183 km x 28.8 deg and then a second burn at 0935 UTC to
insert SOHO onto an interplanetary trajectory towards the Earth-Sun L1
Lagrange point, 1.5 million km from Earth in the direction of the
Sun. The Centaur separated from SOHO at 1009 UTC; around 1045 UTC
diffuse emission (reported as a possible new comet!) was seen by
observers in the Northeastern US which may be associated with Centaur
venting. The Centaur was inserted in an orbit with an apogee of 1.15
million km, and is likely to end up in solar orbit after a couple of
revolutions because of perturbations.  (Thanks to Joel Runes for some
details in this report).

SOHO carries telescopes, spectrometers and coronagraphs to study the
atmosphere of the Sun, and particle detectors to study the composition
and state of the solar wind. Unlike earlier solar observatories,
however, SOHO also carries instruments to precisely measure
oscillations of the Sun, which can be used to study the interior
structure of the Sun - a technique called helioseismology. The 1850 kg
spacecraft was built by Matra Marconi Space.

ISO lowered its apogee on Nov 24 and is now in a 1437.16 min, 1036 x
70578 km x 5.2 deg orbit. The perigee burn was at 1310 UTC on Nov 19 and
the apogee burn was at 0245 on Nov 24. The cryostat cover was ejected at
1027 UTC on Nov 27 and the first light image (of the galaxy M51) was
taken on Nov 28. The LWS spectrometer has now detected its first spectral
lines.

The Meteosat 3 and Meteosat 4 weather satellites have now both been
removed from geostationary orbit.  Meteosat 4's orbit was raised
starting  at 2030 UTC on Nov 6. Meteosat 3's orbit  was raised in a
series of burns from Nov 21 at 2115 UTC to Nov 22 at 2135 UTC. (Thanks
to C. Groen-Nielsen, ESA). Thanks to several readers for confirming
that Galaxy 3 has been retired.

The Galileo Probe and Galileo Orbiter are approaching the planet
Jupiter - arrival day is Dec 7. The Orbiter entered
the Jovian magnetosphere on Nov 26.

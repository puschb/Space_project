Oops

Apologies to some of my Canadian readers, apparently an error in my mailing
list has been leaving a whole bunch of you off. I think it's fixed now.
(How many issues did you miss?) 

Galileo at Jupiter
------------------

The two Galileo space probes have reached Jupiter. NASA Ames Research
Center's Galileo Probe was released from the Galileo Orbiter in July;
it entered the atmosphere of Jupiter at 2204 UTC on Dec 7 at latitude
6.5 deg N, longitude 4.4 deg W in the NEB.  The probe on-board timer
was due to activate the probe at 1600 UTC after 5 months of
dormancy. At 2311 UTC confirmation was received on Earth that the
Orbiter was receiving data from the Probe. The parachute was deployed
at 2206 UTC and a few seconds later the deceleration module
(heatshield) was jettisoned.  The probe was due to continue
transmitting data until 2319 UTC.  Theoretical analysis indicates that
the probe parachute would melt at 2349 UTC and the internal probe
equipment, made of aluminium, would melt around 0030 UTC with the
probe's titanium structure surviving much deeper into the atmosphere,
disintegrating at around 0700 UTC on Dec 8.

Perijove for the Jet Propulsion Laboratory's Galileo Orbiter
spacecraft was at 2153 UTC on Dec 7 at distance of 214600 km from the
center of the giant planet. Closest approach to Europa was 30921 km at
1309 UTC Dec 7, and to Io was 1000 km at 1745 UTC. Galileo has now
entered orbit around Jupiter.  The S400 liquid apogee engine ignited
at 0027 UTC Dec 8 and completed its burn at 0116 UTC on Dec
8. Galileo's first orbit was planned to have a perijove of 2 Jupiter
radii and an apojove of 250 Jupiter radii. I don't have actual orbital
elements yet.


Shuttle
-------

The next Shuttle mission is STS-72, scheduled for January 11. The
STS-72 stack with orbiter Endeavour was rolled out from VAB bay 3 to
pad 39B on Dec 6. Endeavour's cargo bay contains eight small carriers
mounted on the port and starboard bay walls in bays 1 to 4, containing
equipment related to the EDFT-3 spacewalk. If any reader has
information about this payload-bay mounted EDFT-3 equipment, please
let me know.

Mir
---

Launch of the Progress M-30 cargo ferry is expected on December 15.

Recent Launches
--------------

A Lockheed Martin Titan 4 launch vehicle (serial K-15) was sent into
orbit from Space Launch Complex 4-East at Vandenberg Air Force Base on
Dec 5.  The payload is believed to have entered a sun-synchronous
polar orbit and is probably the latest Improved CRYSTAL imaging spy
satellite for the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO). Prime
contractor for the satellite is probably Lockheed. Within the NRO,
responsibility for imaging satellites is given to the CIA. The
satellite probably carries a large optical telescope with optical
and near infrared imaging array (CCD) sensors, as well as the ICMS
mapping system.

Here is the complete list of Titan 4 launches to date; thanks to
several correspondents for helping me refine this, but there may still
be errors - corrections are welcome.

  Notes:
  (1) Classified payload, true name unknown. 'Advanced X' indicates
  a new generation replacing the series which had codename X.
  PARCAE was a US Navy intelligence spacecraft. JUMPSEAT and
  VORTEX were USAF/NSA electronic and signals intelligence payloads.
  ORION was a CIA signals intelligence spacecraft. LACROSSE is
  a radar imaging satellite. Improved CRYSTAL is an optical and
  near infrared imaging satellite.
  All of these missions are classified and my analysis is based on guesses 
  from information in the open literature.
  (2) Titan model 404 may possibly carry the Titan Payload Adapter (TPA) 
  designed to support payloads originally built for Shuttle launch.
  (3) Launch failure.

Arianespace SA launched the V81 Ariane mission on Dec 6.  Launch was
at 2323 UT; at 2340 UT the H-10-III third stage shut down, entering
geostationary transfer orbit. At 2344 the Telecom 2C satellite
separated, followed by the Mini-SPELDA adapter plate, and at 2349 UT
the Insat 2C satellite was released. The satellites entered a 630.1
min, 224 x 35712 km x 6.8 deg transfer orbit.  V81 was the 11th flight
of Ariane in 1995, all of which have been successful.

Telecom 2C is a Matra Marconi Space comsat for France Telecom.
The spacecraft carries 10 C-band and 11 Ku-band transponders
for French domestic communications and communications with
the departements d'outremer. It also has 5 X-band transponders
for the Delegation Generale pour l'Armement, which operates
the military Syracuse communications network. The mass
of Telecom 2C is 1120 kg, with a fuel load of 1163 kg giving
a launch mass of 2283 kg. 
The spacecraft has an R-4D-12 liquid apogee engine which will
be used to place it in geostationary orbit at 3 degrees E.

Insat 2C is the Indian Space Research Organization's latest 
domestic communications, television and radio broadcast satellite.
It carries 22 C-band and 4 Ku-band transponders, as well as
an S-band transponder for mobile services. The spacecraft
and its internal LAM (Liquid Apogee Motor) were built
by ISRO with its Indian industrial partners.

Erratum: The Chinese EPKM perigee kick motor, designated SPTM-17, has
flown once before, on the first CZ-2E launch, but it did not place its
dummy payload in geostationary transfer orbit. The Asiasat 2 launch
was the first time the SPTM-17 was flown with a real payload.

The Asiasat 2 satellite carries a Leros-class dual mode liquid apogee
engine built by Royal Ordnance plc, England (I don't know which
particular model, though).  Asiasat 2 fired its engine last week to
enter a 5326 x 35031 km x 13.8 deg intermediate orbit, and again on
Dec 4 to enter a circular 1403.9 min, 34375 x 35932 km x 0.6 deg drift
orbit. On Dec 5 it was over 92 deg E drifiting 3 deg E per day.

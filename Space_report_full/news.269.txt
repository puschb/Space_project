Shuttle
-------

The next Shuttle mission is STS-72, still scheduled for January 11.  Crew of
Endeavour will be Brian Duffy, Brent Jett, Leroy Chiao, Winston Scott,
Koichi Wakata, and Daniel Barry. Wakata is an astronaut from Japan's
NASDA space agency, while the others are from NASA.

Mir
---

RKK Energiya's 7K-TGM transport craft 11F615A55 No. 230 was launched on
Dec 18 from pad 1 at Baykonur and named Progress M-30. Launch was at
1431:35 UTC and it entered an orbit of 89.61 min, 194 x 315 km x 51.6
deg. After correction burns at 1810 and 1904 UTC it was in a 89.90 min,
240 x 298 km x 51.6 deg orbit. (Times are from Vladimir Agapov; orbital
data is based on Space Command elements).

On Dec 19 at 0915:05 UTC, transport ship No. 229 (Progress M-29)
undocked from the rear port of Mir, on the Kvant module, into a 92.47
min, 391 x 400 km x 51.6 deg orbit. and at 1526 UTC it fired its engine
to reenter over the Pacific Ocean.  Half an hour later, at 1600 UTC,
Progress M-30 raised its orbit to 90.13 min, 248 x 312 km x 51.6 deg.
At 1615 UTC Progress M-29 burnt up over 48.5 deg S, 158.7 deg W.

Progress M-30 made two more manouvres at 1404 and 1447 UTC on Dec 20,
entering a 92.46 min, 390 x 399 km x 41.6 deg orbit and completing its
rendezvous with Mir. It docked to the vacant port at 1610:15 UTC on Dec
20, delivering cargo to the Mir crew of Gidzenko, Avdeev and Reiter.
The Progress M (11F615A55) series of spacecraft consist of a cargo
module, a fuel section, and a service module. They are based on the
Soyuz (7K) spaceship design. 73 robot cargo ships in the Progress
and Progress M series have now been launched towards the DOS-5, 6 and 7
(Salyut-6, Salyut-7 and Mir) space stations; every single one
has successfully delivered its cargo, although several of the Progress M
ferries had to make more than one attempt at docking.

Recent Launches
--------------

Kosmos-2326 was launched on Dec 20. It is an electronic intelligence
ocean reconnaissance satellite built by KB Arsenal for the Russian
Defense Ministry, and uses a low thrust engine to maintain its 400 km
high, 65 degree orbit. Kosmos-2326 also carries a supplementary
scientific experiment from the Ioffe Institute in St Petersburg,
according to V. Agapov. The experiment is the Konus-A gamma ray
spectrometer, used to detect cosmic gamma ray bursts. Konus-A is a
successor to earlier Konus experiments carried on Venera probes in the
1970s and 1980s.

Launch of Delta 230 with the X-ray Timing Explorer satellite was
scrubbed on Dec 18 at 1501 UTC when the liquid oxygen valve on the first
stage failed to open and the main engine did not ignite. The vernier
engines ignited briefly but the solids were not commanded to ignite and
the vehicle remained safely on the pad.

The Russian spy satellite Kosmos-2305 may have completed its mission and
been deorbited  around 0h UTC on Dec 19. Two new objects were tracked in
orbit around that time. Orbit of Kosmos-2305 on Dec 18 was 89.77 min,
239 x 286 km x 64.9 deg. Kosmos-2305 was launched in Dec 1994; its
companion spacecraft Kosmos-2320 remains in a similar orbit.

Shuttle Processing Explanation (or,  what are all these acronyms
anyway?):

 The Shuttle consists of an Orbiter (OV), an expendable External Tank
(ET), and a reusable pair of Redesigned Solid Rocket Motors (RSRM).  The
OV is prepared for flight in the Orbiter Processing Facility (OPF) which
consists of three bays (one of which is actually a separate building)
after which it is towed to the Vehicle Assembly Building (VAB) and
`mated to the stack' or joined to the ET and RSRM. First, the segments
of the RSRM are stacked up on a Mobile Launch Platform (ML) and then the
ET is connected to it. After the OV is mated, a Crawler-Transporter is
moved underneath the ML and carries the ML/RSRM/ET/OV stack to one of
the two pads (A or B) at launch complex 39 (LC39) where it is eventually
launched on a Space Transportation System (STS) mission. Occasionally
an OV is returned to the Rockwell International plant in Palmdale,
California for refit - an Orbiter Maintenance Down Period or OMDP.

Shuttle
-------

The next Shuttle mission is STS-72, still scheduled for January 11.  

Mir
---

The 20th main expedition to the Mir complex continues its work. On Jan 1
at 0000:00 UTC, the crew of Yuriy Gidzenko, Sergey Avdeev, and Thomas
Reiter had been in flight for 119 days 14 hours 59 min 38 sec
(remembering to put in that leap second at 1995 Dec 31d 23h 59m 60s!)
since the liftoff of their Soyuz TM-22 spaceship from pad 1 at Baykonur
on Sep 3.

Recent Launches
--------------

The Indian Space Research Organization's IRS-1C (Indian Remote Sensing
Satellite) satellite was launched from Baykonur on Dec 28. This was the
first Russian launch into a retrograde (99 degree) orbit using the
Molniya-M four stage rocket; earlier Russian retrograde launches used
the Vostok rocket which has now been retired.  The Molniya-M for this
flight used a fourth stage called the Blok 2BL, which fired to place
IRS-1C in a circular 101.1 min, 805 x 817 km x 98.6 deg sun-synchronous
orbit. The Blok-I third stage appears to have been suborbital, the first
time such a flight profile has been used. The IRS-1C is more advanced
than earlier Indian remote sensing satellites, with a 10-m resolution
panchromatic camera and a 20-m resolution multispectral camera.

Also launched with IRS-1C was the Skipper subsatellite, a joint project
between the US Ballistic Missile Defense Organization and the Russian
Defense Ministry which will simulate ICBM reentry and test out
aerobraking techniques. According to my rather out of date information,
the payload is built by the Utah State University Space Dynamics Lab in
collaboration with the Moscow Aviation Institute and has a mass of 230
kg; it will maneuver to a low perigee and then deorbit over Kwajalein in
the Pacific in about a week. Anyone with more info on Skipper is encouraged
to get in touch.

Echostar 1, a Lockheed Martin Astro Space AS7000 series television
broadcast satellite, was successfully launched by a Chinese Chang Zheng
2E rocket on Dec 28 into low Earth orbit. An EPKM solid kick motor fired
to place the satellite in a 222 x 35081 km x 24.4 deg geostationary
transfer orbit, from where the satellite's liquid apogee engine would
further raise the orbit to a circular geostationary one. Echostar
carries 16 Ku-band transponders.

NASA-Goddard's X-Ray Timing Explorer satellite was launched on Dec 30
from pad 17A at Cape Canaveral. It entered a 565 x 583 km x 23.0 deg
orbit. The satellite carries  the PCA (Proportional Counter Array)
instrument with large collecting area but low spatial resolution, for
accurate timing and 2-60 keV spectral measurements of bright X-ray
sources. The HEXTE (High Energy X-ray Timing Experiment) will study
X-rays of higher energy (up to 200 keV) and the ASM (All Sky Monitor)
has a wide field of view to spot X-ray flare stars and burst sources in
the 2-10 keV range.. XTE was built by NASA-Goddard Space Flight Center.

XTE's launch vehicle was a two stage McDonnell Douglas Delta 7920-10
model, Delta 230. Launch was at 1348 UTC on Dec 30; first the two liquid
vernier engines ignite, and immediately afterwards the main engine
ignited successfully, 2.5 seconds before liftoff. Six of the nine
Hercules GEM solid rocket motors (Nos. 1,2,3,7,8 and 9) ignited and the
vehicle left the pad. The six solids burnt out and separated as solids
4,5 and 6 ignited, at around T+1 min 5 sec. Solids 4,5 and 6 then burnt
out and separated at 2min 11 sec. The main RS-27 engine cutoff at 4min
20 sec and the first, Thor-derived, stage fell away at 4:29. The Delta
second stage ignited its AJ-10-118K liquid engine at 4:34 and the
10-foot payload shroud, having survived those upper-level winds, was
jettisoned at 4:40, at an altitude of 143 km. The first burn of the
second stage shut down at 1358 UTC, T+9:55, with Delta/XTE in a  157 x
613 km x 28.73 deg Earth orbit. The combination coasted toward apogee
for an hour, and at 1456 (T+1:08:18) the Delta reignited for a 1 min 31
sec burn to circularize the orbit at 565 x 583 km x 23.0 deg. Delta 230
separated from XTE at 1506 UTC. At 1526 UTC Delta 230 ignited for the
third time in an evasive maneuver to leave  the vicinity of XTE, and at
1534 UTC the AJ-10-118K was turned on for the fourth and last time in a
depletion burn intended to lower the orbit and get rid of residual
propellant, to avoid the possibility of  a later explosion (in the 1970s
exploding relic Delta stages were responsible for significant
contributions to the orbital debris population). It ended up in a 176 x
575 km x 25.0 deg orbit and should reenter rapidly.

Satellite catalog number 23658, which had been reserved for the
Fasat-Alfa Chilean subsatellite that failed to separate from Sich-1, has
now been assigned to the Centaur AC-117 stage from the JCSAT-3 launch,
which on Dec 17 was tracked in a 175 x 79168 km x 22.93 deg orbit.
Cataloged with Kosmos-2326 (1995-71A, 23748) is the rocket stage
(1995-71C, 23750) which reentered on the day of launch, implying the
existence of an object (1995-71B, 23749) for which no elements have yet
been released. This may be a misunderstanding based on the incorrect
assumption that the Konus-A experiment is intended to separate from the
main satellite, and the catalog number may be reassigned. The Goddard
OIG group has reported the decay of object 23453 (Kosmos-2305), as
suggested by me in JSR 269, although they confused the issue by
labelling it  Kosmos-398!

The Gals 2 satellite has been positioned at 70.9E over the Indian
Ocean. Asiasat 2 has reached geostationary position at 100.5E.
Telecom 2C fired its apogee engine between Dec 17 and 
Dec 21, immediately reaching its geostationary location at 1.0E.
Insat 2C arrived at its 92.5E position on Dec 19.
On Dec 24 Galaxy 3R raised its transfer orbit to 
1292.35 min, 30054 x 35793 km x 1.4 deg.
Another engine firing on Dec 26 completed the ascent to synchronous
altitude, placing it in a 1435.46 min, 35756 x 35792 km x 0.1 deg
orbit drifting E over 94.9W.

TDRS 1 left its 139.6W position in mid December to drift E.
The German television satellite DFS Kopernikus 1 left its 33E slot
on around Dec 14.
The US Navy UHF F6 completed its testing period at 171W and moved
during November-December to a new location at 105.3W.
Intelsat 503 has reached a new station at 157.0E.

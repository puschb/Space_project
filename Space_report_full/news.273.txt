Shuttle
-------

Shuttle mission STS-72 has been completed with two satellite retrievals
and two spacewalks. Endeavour completed its rendezvous with the Space
Flyer Unit satellite on Jan 13. The SFU successfully retracted its solar
panels, but failed to latch them, so the decision was made to jettison
them. The first panel was ejected at 0935 UTC and the second at 0947
UTC. At 1057 UTC the RMS 303 robot arm was used to grapple SFU, and it
was berthed in Endeavour's payload bay at 1139 UTC. SFU carried science
and technology experiments for Japan's National Space Development
Agency.

Endeavour then lowered its orbit to 302 x 311 km x 28.5 deg. The
OAST-Flyer (Spartan 206) satellite was released using the RMS arm at
1132 UTC on Jan 14. OAST-Flyer carries an experiment to measure
contamination caused by spacecraft outgassing, and a test of a
laser-fired explosive separation device to make sure the device doesn't
go off accidentally in sunlight. It also carried an amateur radio
experiment.

Astronauts Leroy Chiao and Daniel Barry carried out a spacewalk on Jan
15. The airlock was depressurized at 0525 UTC, and NASA declared the EVA
in progress at 0535 UTC. The hatch was opened at 0540 UTC. Chiao and
Barry  tested out Space Station equipment including a portable work
platform and a rigid umbilical truss for carrying electrical cables and
fluid lines. The astronauts returned to the airlock at 1130 UTC and
closed the hatch 3 minutes later, returning their suits to orbiter power
and repressurizing the airlock at 1144 UTC. NASA's official time for the
walk was 6h 9m 19s, while I would give it an extra ten minutes (counting
from depressurization rather than battery power). 

On Jan 15-16 the Shuttle carried out a series of rendezvous burns to
approach the OAST-Flyer Spartan, and on Jan 16 at 0947 UTC Wakata
grappled the satellite with the RMS arm.

The second spacewalk to test out Space Station tools and equipment was
performed by Chiao and Winston Scott. It started a little behind
schedule, with depressurization at 0534 UTC on Jan 17, and hatch opening
at 0554. The spacewalk ended at 1234 UTC, for a duration of 7 hours 0
min (depress to repress) or 6h 53m 41s (on-battery-power to repress, the
official NASA number). Scott tested out the thermal modifications
to the spacesuit by standing in shadow on the Spartan Flight Support
Structure while the Orbiter was turned to make the payload bay
as cold as possible.

Endeavour closed its payload bay doors early on Jan 20, firing its
braking rockets at 0641 UTC and reentered to a nighttime landing on
runway 15 at Kennedy Space Center at 0742 UTC on Jan 20.
The next Shuttle mission is STS-75, with orbiter Columbia and the
reflight of the 20 km long tethered satellite, which failed on
its first flight in 1992.

Errata
--------

I was wrong! Fred Cerkan informs me that STS-72 was not the
first flight with no TAL requirement - STS-1, the very
first mission, had no TAL requirement or TAL capability.

IRS-1C's panchromatic camera has a resolution of under 6 m, not
10m as I said earlier. Thanks to several readers for the correction.


Request for Info
----------------

Know anyone who worked for ABL in the 1960s? I'm trying to find
information on the MG-18 rocket, a version of the X-258 Altair II used
as an upper stage on Scout and Thor. Any info welcome.

Recent Launches
--------------

Ariane V82 was launched on Jan 12 from Kourou. It was an Ariane 44L
model with the H-10-III upper stage. V82 carried two communications
satellites, PAS 3R and Measat 1. PAS 3R is a Hughes HS-601 comsat with a
launch mass of 2918 kg, to provide C and Ku band communications and
television broadcasting services for the Atlantic Ocean region. It is
due to be stationed at 43 deg W, and carries 16 C-band and 16 Ku-band
transponders. PAS 3R replaces PAS 3, lost in a launch accident in 1994.
MEASAT 1 (Malaysia/East Asia Satellite) is another Hughes satellite,
this time the older HS-376 spin-stabilized model. Measat 1 is owned by
Binariang Sdn. Bhd., the Malaysian telecommunications agency, and will
provide C and Ku-band telecommunications services over Malaysia and the
rest of SE Asia.

Delta 231 was launched on Jan 14 from Cape Canaveral Air Station and
successfully rocketed to geostationary transfer orbit of 1357 x 35418 km
x 21.0 deg. Payload of Delta 231 was Koreasat 2, a Lockheed Martin Astro
Space AS3000 class comsat. Koreasat 1, launched last year, used up half
its stationkeeping fuel reaching geostationary orbit after a launch
malfunction left it in a lower than normal transfer orbit. The Koreasat
(Mugunghwa) satellites are owned by Korea Telecom. The McDonnell Douglas
launch vehicle was a 7925 model.

Kosmos-2327 was launched on Jan 16 from Plesetsk into a 947 x 1020 km x
83.0 deg orbit, characteristic of a navigation satellite in the Parus
series. It is in the same plane as the Parus satellite launched in Nov
1993 and named Kosmos-2266. The ground track is consistent with an
ontime launch at 1534 UTC. Launch vehicle was a Kosmos-3M from the Polyot
organization.

It has now been confirmed that the capsule found in Ghana last year
is the reentry vehicle from the German Express microgravity satellite
which failed to reach its planned orbit in Jan 1995. Negotiations are
underway for its return to Germany.

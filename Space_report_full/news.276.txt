Shuttle
-------

The next Shuttle mission is STS-75/Columbia, due on Feb 22.


Mir
---

Correction: The spacewalk on Feb 8 was cut short because
the astronauts didn't have powerful enough tools to release
a bolt on an antenna they were doing maintenance on. The
rumour about problems with Gidzenko's spacesuit is apparently
false, and I apologize for propagating it. (Source: C vd Berg).

Launch of the EO-21 crew, Yuriy Ivanovich Onufrienko and Yuriy
Vladimirovich Usachyov (callsign Skif-1 and Skif-2) will take place on
Feb 21 aboard Soyuz TM-23.

Recent Launches
--------------

The Intelsat 708 satellite was launched by the first CZ-3B
(Chang Zheng/Long March 3B) on Feb 14. The launch vehicle
went off course shortly after leaving the pad and was destroyed
about 20s after liftoff.
This is the third failure in recent years for the Long March
rocket (the other failures used the older CZ-2E variant). Two
successful launches late last year had restored its reputation, but
after the latest failure insurers are likely to be wary.
Launch time was quoted as 03:01 local time.
AP reported that two soldiers were slightly injured in the blast.

The CZ-3B uses the stretched first stage from the CZ-3A, which
flew once in 1994, the strap-on motors from the CZ-2E, the usual
second stage common to the CZ-2/3 series, and the hydrogen/oxygen
high energy third stage from the CZ-3A. 

The NEAR space probe was launched on Feb 17 at 2043 UTC. The first of
NASA's Discovery planetary series, NEAR (Near Earth Asteroid Rendezvous)
is built by the Applied Physics Lab (APL) of Johns Hopkins University.
The Delta 7925-8 launches NEAR into solar orbit with perihelion of about
1.0 AU and aphelion of about 2.5 AU (anyone with accurate orbital
data, please send me the details). In Jun 1997 NEAR flies past minor
planet (253) Mathilde, and in Jul 1997 it makes a course correction for
an Earth flyby in Jan 1998. The Earth flyby, at an altitude of about 480
km, lowers aphelion to around 1.7 AU. In Jan 1999, NEAR makes rendezvous
with minor planet (433) Eros and enters orbit around it. The 805 kg
spacecraft carries a liquid propellant engine with a 100-lb thruster, a
multispectral imaging camera, an X/gamma-ray spectrometer to study
asteroid composition, a near infrared spectrograph, a magnetometer, a
laser rangefinder, and an X-band communications transponder used for
tracking. The Delta second stage placed NEAR in a 185 km parking orbit
at 2052 UTC; it ignited again at 2105 and burned for 3 minutes. At 2109
the PAM-D third stage solid motor ignited; at around 2111 the PAM-D
separated and NEAR began to deploy its solar panels. The Canberra tracking
station confirmed successful launch at around 2200 UTC.

Obituary
--------

Spaceflight journalist and analyst Joel Runes died of a heart attack on
Jan 11.  Joel was a frequent contributor of information to this
newsletter, and a nice guy whose friendship, analytical skills and
common sense were greatly valued. A former Goddard Space Flight Center
engineer, Joel lived in Florida and reported in detail on every launch
from the Cape.

Mikhail Reshetnev died on Jan 26, not Jan 29 (thanks, Maxim).

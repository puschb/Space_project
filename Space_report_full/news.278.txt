Editorial: Thanks to Dave Ransom and Maxim Tarasenko for feeding me with
info while I was on vacation, and to Lee Bronstein and Dave Koster for
their hospitality on the West Coast. More snow here tomorrow, sigh.. :-)

Shuttle
-------

Columbia was launched at 2018:00 UTC on Feb 22 on mission STS-75. During
ascent, the crew reported a low thrust indication on one main engine 
but the ground was able to confirm that propulsion was operating OK.
After the OMS 2 burn, the ship entered a 298 x 303 km x 28.5 deg orbit.
The tethered satellite TSS-1 was deployed on Feb 25, with first motion
at 2045 UTC. At 2145 UTC the tether was at over 270m, and by around 
0100 UTC on Feb 26 the TSS satellite was at almost 22 km. At 0130 UTC on
Feb 26 the tether broke at the deployer end, and the TSS satellite plus
tether rapidly separated from Columbia. It entered a higher 316 x 413 km
x 28.5 deg orbit (Columbia's orbit at the time was 291 x 299 km) thus
demonstrating inadvertently the use of tethers for changing orbits
without using rocket fuel. At around 1740 UTC the astronauts began
retracting the remaining tether and stowing the deployer boom. By Mar 4
Columbia's orbit had decayed to 282 x 293 km as the astronauts continued
experiments with the USMP-3 materials processing payload.

Mir
---

Soyuz TM-23 docked with Mir at 1420:35 on Feb 23. The new crew
of Yuriy Onufrienko and Yuriy Usachyov are working aboard the station.
The Mir complex is in a 390 x 398 km x 51.6 deg orbit.
On Feb 22 at 0726 UTC the Progress M-30 cargo ship undocked, and
it was deorbited over the Pacific at 1428 UTC. On Feb 29 the previous
crew of Gidzenko, Avdeev and Reiter undocked from Mir in Soyuz TM-22,
and at 1042 UTC they landed in Kazakhstan after 179d 1h 42min in space.

Recent Launches
---------------

NASA's Polar satellite, to study the magnetosphere, was launched from
Vandenberg by McDonnell Douglas Delta 7925-10 into a 185 x 50494 km x
86.0 deg orbit on Feb 24. It is built by Lockheed Martin Astro Space and
is similar to the Wind satellite launched in 1994. Wind and Polar
are part of the Global Geospace Science project.

 Polar will raise its perigee over the next week. It carries two booms
and six long wire antennae. In the `equatorial' plane of the satellite
are a pair of antennae spanning 130 meters and, at right angles, another
pair of antennae spanning 100 meters. Along the spin axis of the
satellite are another pair of antennae with a span of 14 meters. These
antennae are used to study electric and magnetic fields for the PWI
(Polar  Plasma Wave Investigation) and EFI (Electric Field Instrument)
experiments. Two larger but shorter (6-m long) booms carry more PWI
instruments and the MFE (Magnetic Field Experiment). Other instruments
on the spacecraft body include the TIMAS (Toroidal Imaging Mass-Angle
Spectrograph) to study  fluxes of ions as a function of direction,  the
TIDE (Thermal Ion Dynamics Experiment) and PSI (Plasma Source
Instrument) which study connections between the polar ionosphere and the
magnetotail,  the VIS (Visible Imaging System) and  UVI (Ultraviolet
Imager) which  measure auroral emissions. PIXIE (Polar Ionospheric X-ray
Imaging Experiment) studies X-rays produced by energetic electrons in
the upper atmosphere. CAMMICE (Charge and Mass Magnetospheric Ion
Composition Experiment)  studies the isotopic composition of energetic
ions. The CEPPAD (Comprehensive Energetic Particle Pitch Angle
Distribution) studies high energy protons and electrons.

The XTE satellite launched last December has been renamed RXTE - the
Bruno B. Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer, or loosely the Rossi X-ray Timing
Explorer. The All Sky Monitor experiment has been turned on again,
although one of the counters is still having problems.

Trip Report - What I Did On My Vacation
-----------

Stop one: UTC in San Jose. The Titan solid motor plant is  nestled in
the hills over Silicon Valley. United Technologies Corp's Chemical
Systems Division makes the solid boosters for Titan, but
Alliant/Hercules has the contract for the new boosters, so work on the
project is winding down now. The UTC/CSD Titan boosters have powered
Titan 3C, 3D, 3E, 34D and 4 since 1965 and provided the only experience
base on large solid motors prior to the Shuttle. UTC also built the
first stage of Scout, the solid motors used in Boeing's IUS upper stage,
and the Orbus solid motors used most famously in the Intelsat rescue
mission STS-49 in 1992. I was lucky to see several Titan segments up
fairly close, and the test stand where complete solid motors were fired
wrong end up.

Stop two: the JPL Archives. Lots of the details of the early Explorer
program were classified at the time, but are now available.  After the
Russian success of Sputnik over Vanguard, the JPL/Huntsville team
initiated Project Deal. The idea was that when you lose a round while
playing poker, you say 'Deal!' to begin another round hoping to win the
rematch. Filed under Deal in the archives are the engineering drawings
for payload RTV-7/Deal I, dated Dec 1957 and Jan 1958. This is actually
the payload which was named Explorer I after launch - America's first
satellite. Does anyone know who came up with the Explorer name and when
it was first used? Project Deal III was the Beacon satellite which
would have been Explorer VI if it had reached orbit. I haven't found
Deal II but suspect it is Explorer II and III, with Explorer IV and V
not having a Deal name. The plans for Deal III, already in embryo
prior to the Explorer I launch, include the first description I have
seen of an idea described by them as the 'kick in the apogee' - the origin
of the apogee kick motor used to raise perigee after orbit insertion.

Stop three: Vandenberg Air Force Base. Space Launch Complex 10 is
a fascinating site, currently in the care of Jay Pritchard who is
knowledgeable and enthusiastic. He has a Thor IRBM horizontal on
its launch transporter inside the complex, which is covered by a roll-off
shelter. The launch control center still has working consoles; it
was last used in 1980 but some of the equipment is still turned on.
Among other artifacts in Pritchard's embryonic museum are Minuteman
stages and a complete Agena D sealed in its transporter. SLC-10 was used
for weather satellite launches, RAF Thor missile tests, and training
crews for the Program 437 antisatellite weapon based on Johnston Island
in the Pacific. Space Launch Complex 6, on the former Point Arguello
Naval Missile Facility in South Vandenberg, is a gargantuan complex
built for Space Shuttle launches. Staring down from the gantry
used to launch the tiny (in comparison) Lockheed Launch Vehicle,
one can see light shining from the outside into the greenish
water at the bottom of the flame trench far below, an eerily beautiful
sight. Small pieces of burned solid propellant from the LLV-1 launch
can be picked up from the concrete apron around the pad. In contrast
to the hi-tech SLC-6, the jetty at which Shuttle SRBs would be towed
back from the ocean is overlooked by a quaint Coastguard house, a
white two-story mansion with red windowframes that looks like it should
be on Nantucket rather than be part of the Western Space and Missile
Center. While at Vandenberg, I also visited the base historian
Jeff Geiger and the Lompoc public library (the back issues of the local
newspaper contain satellite launch times unavailable elsewhere), and the
results of those enquires should lead to some more historical articles
in Quest and JBIS.

Stop four: .. well, the rest was fun but not relevant to this
newsletter. Now back to our regularly scheduled programming.

Shuttle
-------

OV-104 Atlantis has been launched on the third Mir docking mission,
STS-76. Liftoff was on Mar 22 at 0813:04 UTC. There was a leak in the
hydraulic system during ascent; it is not yet clear whether this will
affect mission duration, but at the moment it looks like there is no
problem. The RSRM-46 solid rocket motors separated 2 min after launch;
the main engine cutoff was at about 0821:34 and the  separation of
External Tank ET-77 came ten seconds later. This was the 76th Shuttle
launch. The OMS-2 burn placed Atlantis in a 157 x 292 km x 51.6 deg
orbit; the NC-1 burn later put it in a 226 x 294 km x 51.6 deg orbit. 
(Can anyone tell me when the burns happened?) Docking with the Mir
station is scheduled for 0234 UTC on Mar 24. The spacewalk is due for
Mar 27, and the undocking for Mar 29 with landing on Mar 31.

The MEEP PEC experiments, which will be transferred to the exterior
of Mir during the spacewalk, are mounted on ICAPC (Increased Capacity
Adaptive Payload Carriers), not GAS Beams as I suggested last week.
They are in bays 11 Port, 11 Starboard, 12 Port, and 12 Starboard.
The TRIS experiment is on bay 13 Starboard.

Mir
---

EO-21 astronauts Yuriy Onufrienko and Yuriy Usachyov made a spacewalk
on Mar 15. They left the Kvant-2 airlock at 0104 UTC and installed
a second Strela crane on the Mir base block. The Strela is used to
move spacewalkers and their equipment from one side of the station
to another. The existing one wouldn't reach the Kristall module,
which the new one will allow. The spacewalkers also went to the Kvant
(37KE) module and did preparatory work for attaching a new solar
array. Duration of the space walk was 5h 51m.  (Info from C vd Berg).
Shannon Lucid will become one of the EO-21 crew when her Soyuz 
reentry couch is transferred from Atlantis after the docking.

In a classic display of leftover Soviet-era male chauvinism, Gagarin
Training Center deputy commander Gen. Glazkov reported that they
expected improved living conditions on Mir with NASA astronaut Lucid
aboard "because we know that women love to clean" (AP report). This from
the space agency which hailed Svetlana Savitskaya's 1984 first spacewalk
by a woman with "now Soviet space technology is advanced enough that
[even] a woman can make spacewalks". Excuse me?


Recent Launches
---------------

The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) has launched IRS-P3,
a remote sensing satellite, using its solid-propellant 4-stage Polar
Satellite Launch Vehicle, PSLV. Launch was from the Sriharikota
Island range; this was the third PSLV launch, and the second success.
Other IRS satellites have been launched with Russian rockets, most
recently in December. IRS-P3 is in an 802 x 848 km x 98.8 deg orbit.

  IRS satellites:

  IRS-1A  1988 Mar 17  Vostok, Baykonur       870 x 914 km x 99.0 deg
  IRS-1B  1991 Aug 29  Vostok, Baykonur       862 x 918 km x 99.2 deg
  IRS-1E  1993 Sep 20  PSLV-D1, Sriharikota    (Failed)
  IRS-P2  1994 Oct 15  PSLV-D2, Sriharikota   798 x 882 km x 98.7 deg
  IRS-1C  1995 Dec 28  Molniya-M, Baykonur    816 x 818 km x 98.6 deg
  IRS-P3  1996 Mar 21  PSLV-D3, Sriharikota   802 x 848 km x 98.8 deg

India's first satellite was Aryabhata, launched by a Soviet rocket in
1975. Its first domestic launch vehicle was the SLV-3, first flown
in 1979 and first flown successfully in 1980. IRS-P3 is the sixth
Indian launch to reach orbit.

The TSS-1 untethered satellite reentered (with its 20 km tether) at
2312 UTC on 19 Mar, according to Space Command. Late on Mar 19 it was
in a 193 x 210 km x 28.5 deg orbit, and reentry was over the Middle
East/Persian Gulf region.

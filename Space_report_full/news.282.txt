Apologies to those on the email list for the spurious messages, you
shouldn't get any more of these. The list setup program, which  should
have configured the list to prevent other people sending to it, had a
bug in it, which has now been fixed. Thanks to all of you who did NOT
immediately send `er, what's going on?' followup messages to the whole
list - I've seen that sort of problem exponentiate rapidly on other
lists!

Shuttle and Mir
---------------

OV-104 Atlantis has been launched on the third Mir docking mission,
STS-76. Liftoff was on Mar 22 at 0813:04 UTC. Docking with the Mir
station was accomplished at 0234 UTC on Mar 24; the docking ring was
retracted for hard dock at 0247 UTC. The Atlantis crew  entered Mir a
few hours later, and by the following day Lucid's Soyuz reentry seat had
been transferred to Soyuz TM-23, allowing Lucid to become part of the
Mir EO-21 crew. As part of the STS-76 crew, Lucid was Mission Specialist
4; as part of EO-21, she will have the callsign Skif-3 and I'm guessing
that she is designated Bortinzhener-2 (Flight Engineer 2) rather than
Kosmonavt-Issledovatel' (Research Engineer), but I'm not sure. (Can
anyone help on this one? Maxim?)

On Mar 27 astronauts Linda Godwin and Rich Clifford made an EVA from the
airlock in the Tunnel Adapter between Atlantis's middeck cabin and the
Orbiter Docking System. Using the NASA times which refer to use of
battery power, the spacewalk began at 0636 UTC and ended at 1238 UTC; I
don't have the depressurization/repressurization times since I was too
busy looking at the comet. The astronauts moved the four Mir
Environmental Experiment Payloads from the rear of the Orbiter cargo bay
to the exterior of Mir's Docking Module, and removed a television camera
from the Docking Module exterior.

The Atlantis astronauts returned to the Shuttle and closed the
hatches at around 1300 UTC on Mar 28. They undocked at 0108 UTC
on Mar 29, and flew slowly around the complex,
separating at 0208 UTC. Landing is due for 1257 UTC on Mar 30, shortening
the mission by one day compared to the original plan. The Mir/Atlantis
complex is in a 390 x 397 km x 51.6 deg orbit.

The Great (?) Comet of 1996
---------------------------

Meanwhile, Comet C/1996 B2 Hyakutake, which reached perigee of 15
million km on Mar 25, is easily visible to the naked eye even in the
partly cloudy, bright skies of Cambridge, MA. As seen from the darker
skies of Walden Pond on Mar 27, the  comet's tail stretched from Polaris
most of the way to the pointer stars of the Great Bear. This is the Real
Thing - if you've only seen it from an urban area, make sure to catch it
from a rural  dark site in the next few days. Brian Marsden of the IAU
Central Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams says *he* doesn't consider
this a Great Comet in the historically used sense, and we should hang on
for Hale-Bopp next year, but *I'm* impressed nevertheless.

Obituary
--------

Former astronaut Col. Robert Overmyer, 59, was killed on Mar 22 in
Duluth, Minnesota, while  the prototype Cirrus Design VK30 small
airplane he was flying went into an unrecoverable spin. Overmyer was
selected as a USAF Manned Orbiting Laboratory  astronaut in 1966, and
transferred to NASA in 1969.  He was pilot of STS-5/Columbia,  and
commander of mission 51-B/Challenger (Spacelab 3).

Recent Launches
---------------

A Rockwell Block IIA Navstar Global Positioning System (GPS) satellite
was launched on Mar 28. It will be placed in plane C. I don't have the
SVN number of the satellite yet; Navstar SVN 30, 33, 38 and 40 remained
to be launched in the Block IIA series. Launch was by a McDonnell
Douglas Delta 7925, which placed the satellite in a 192 x 20269 km x
34.9 deg transfer orbit. A solid Thiokol Star 37 apogee motor will
circularize the orbit at 20000 km.

Intelsat 707 reached its 1.0 deg E geostationary position on Mar 22.

The Skipper satellite, launched last December, reportedly failed one
day after deployment because the solar panels were wired to discharge
instead of charge. Skipper was to have tested ballistic missile
defense technologies in an aerobraking orbit, but remains instead in
its original 800 km circular track.

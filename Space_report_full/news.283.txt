Editorial
---------

There have been some more problems with the mailer here at CfA - please
let me know if you didn't get JSR 282.

Shuttle and Mir
---------------

The STS-76 mission was meant to be shortened by one day for a landing
on Mar 30, but in the event bad weather resulted in a waveoff and
Atlantis fired its OMS engines for the deorbit burn at 1223 UTC on Mar 31,
for touchdown on runway 22 at Edwards Air Force Base in California at
1328:57 UTC on Mar 31, giving a mission duration of 9 days 5 hr 15 min
and 53s.

Atlantis was placed atop one of NASA's two SCA Shuttle Carrier Aircraft
for the trip back to Florida. The SCA took off from Edwards on Apr 6 but
five minutes later one of the Boeing 747's engines showed a fire warning
light and the plane returned to Edwards after an abortive 15 minute
flight. The engine has been replaced and another try will be made on Apr
11.

STS-76 Mission Specialist-4, Dr. Shannon Lucid, remains aboard the Mir
complex and is now Mir EO-21 Kosmonavt-Issledovatel'
(Cosmonaut-Researcher).

Space Shuttle Endeavour (OV-105) was moved from the Orbiter
Processing Facility to the Vehicle Assembly Building on Apr 8,
and has been mated to the external tank for STS-77.

Recent Launches
---------------

The Inmarsat III F1 satellite was launched on Apr 3 by a Lockheed Martin
Atlas IIA Centaur rocket. The launch was carried out by Lockheed Martin
Commercial Launch Services. The satellite will provide mobile
communications services at L-band for the International Maritime
Satellite Organization.  The satellite is a Lockheed Martin Astro Space
AS4000 series satellite with a Matra Marconi Space communications
payload and a Star 37 solid apogee motor. The apogee motor was fired
prior to April 8, by which time the Inmarsat was being tracked in a
1414.5 minute, 35174 x 35549 km x 2.7 deg drift orbit.

LKEI (Lockheed Krunichev Energiya International) launched a Proton-K
rocket from Baykonur on Apr 8, carrying an RKK Energiya Blok-DM2 upper
stage and the Astra 1F satellite for SES (Societe Europeene des
Satellites, a company headquartered in Luxembourg). This is the first
commercial launch of a Western-built satellite by a Proton. The Astra 1F
is a Hughes HS-601 television broadcasting satellite.

The Navstar satellite launched on March 28 was GPS SVN 33. By Mar 30 it
had fired its Star 37 apogee motor and was in a 20252 x 20548 km x 54.8
deg orbit. It will be stationed in plane C, slot 2 with code PRN 03. SVN
33 is the satellite which was attacked with an axe by an anti-nuclear
activist a couple of years ago. SVN 10, launched in Sep 1984, was
boosted to a higher orbit and turned off on Mar 26.

Space Command has cataloged a number of fragments in elliptical
orbit with a period of 166 minutes which it has associated with
the 1966-77 launch, FTV 1352. The spacecraft was a second generation
MIDAS infrared early warning development satellite. It is possible that
the association is erroneous and the fragments are actually yet
more clumps of needles from the West Ford (1963-14) passive
communications experiment, which inserted millions of copper
dipoles into similar orbits.

France's Telecom 1C satellite, launched in 1988, has raised its orbit
and is probably retired. It had been stationed at 1.0 deg E.

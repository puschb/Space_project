Shuttle and Mir
---------------

OV-105 Endeavour (mission STS-77) was launched on May 19 at 1030 UTC.
The solid rocket boosters (RSRM-47) separated at 1032 UTC, and the main
engines shut down at 1038 UTC, with external tank ET-78 jettisoned
shortly afterwards, to place the Orbiter in an elliptical transfer
orbit. This was the first launch to use three of the improved Block I
engines. The two smaller OMS engines were fired at apogee at 1112 UTC,
circularizing the orbit. At 1214 UTC opening of the payload bay doors
was complete and Endeavour was declared 'Go for Orbit Ops' in a 280 x
290 km x 39.0 deg orbit.

On May 20 at 1129 UTC the Spartan 207 satellite was deployed from the
robot arm. Endeavour moved 120 m from the satellite, and at 1338 UTC the
Spartan began deploying the Inflatable Antenna Experiment (IAE). Three
28-m booms inflated to push the dish away from the satellite; the dish
then inflated to make a 14-m diameter parabolic antenna. The Spartan/IAE
was observed to tumble slowly. The IAE was jettisoned at 1458 UTC (?) on
May 20. A day later at 1453 UTC on May 21, Canadian astronaut Marc
Garneau used the RMS arm to retrieve Spartan 207 from orbit, together
with its cameras which had filmed the IAE deployment.

On May 22 at 1018 UTC the PAMS STU (Satellite Test Unit) was ejected
from the TEAMS MPESS bridge in the Shuttle's payload bay. PAMS-STU is
intended to test out a passive aerodynamic stabilization and magnetic
damping system. At around 1500 UTC Endeavour returned to PAMS-STU in the
first of three rendezvous operations with the small satellite. A second
rendezvous was conducted on May 25 and the third on May 27.

Meanwhile, aboard the Mir complex, the EO-21 commander Yuriy Onufrienko
and flight engineer 1 Yuriy Usachyov made a spacewalk on May 24 at on
May 20 at 2250 UTC. The cosmonauts removed the US/Russian Mir
Cooperative Solar Array (MCSA) from its location on the exterior of the
316GK Stikovochnoy Otsek (Docking Compartment) and carried it to the
other end of  the complex using the Strela-2 crane. The MCSA was
attached to the 37KE Kvant module, opposite another panel which was
added last year. The EVA concluded at 0410 UTC on May 21 after 5h 20m.
The second spacewalk began on May 24 at 2047 UTC. Onufrienko and
Usachyov completed the installation of the MCSA and connected it
electrically. The spacewalk was concluded on May 25 at 0230 UTC. The
MCSA panel was deployed from its initial folded configuration on  May
25. (Source: C. v.d.Berg's Mir News).

Columbia was transferred to the VAB on May 21 and was mated
to the external tank for STS-78 on May 22.

Recent Launches
---------------

Orbital Sciences Corp. has had another launch success, placing the DoD's
MSTI-3 satellite in orbit aboard a Pegasus. The Lockheed L-1011 carrier
aircraft took off from Vandenberg Air Force Base's runway 30/12 and
proceeded to the drop point at 36 deg 0 min N, 123 deg 0 min W over the
Pacific. The Pegasus rocket was released and a few seconds later ignited
the first of its three stages. It is the 'Pegasus Hybrid' version,
a standard Pegasus with modified fins to accommodate the L-1011 carrier
plane instead of the original B-52. 

MSTI 3 will test out new sensor technology for ballistic missile
defense. The satellite is built by Spectrum Astro Inc, and carries three
sensors: a mid wave IR camera, a short wave IR camera, and a visible
imaging spectrometer. Its goal is to study the IR emission from the
Earth to determine if tactical ballistic missiles can be spotted during
their coast phase against the bright Earth background. Initial checkout
of the satellite is reported to have gone well.

The Galaxy 9 comsat was launched on May 23 by a  McDonnell Douglas Delta
7925 rocket from Cape Canaveral. The Hughes HS-376 satellite will
provide communications for the Hughes Galaxy network.
It has 24 C-band transponders which will be
used for cable TV feeds.

The Russian Space Forces launched a Krunichev Proton-K rocket on
May 25 with an RKK Energiya Blok DM-2 upper stage. The vehicle placed
an NPO Prikladnoi Mekhaniki `Gorizont' communications satellite
in orbit, reportedly nicknamed `Prezidentskiy' since it will provide coverage
of the Russian presidential election campaign to Western Siberia and the
Ural region.

The initial orbit of the putative USA 119 payload, as derived by Rainer
Kracht from  amateur observations, was 312 x 622 km x 63.4 deg. The
payload was later found to have moved to a 1050 x 1150 km x 63.4 deg
orbit, characteristic of the US Navy ocean surveillance triplet
spacecraft. Four objects have been cataloged by Space Command, including
1996-29D = USA-122, but no orbital data have been officially released.

The Italian Satellite per Astronomia a raggi X has been renamed
BeppoSAX in honor of Guiseppe 'Beppo' Occhialini, a pioneer in Italian
gamma ray and cosmic ray astronomy.

The McDonnell Douglas/NASA DC-XA reusable vertical-landing rocket
made its first flight from White Sands on May 18, reaching an apogee of 240 m.

Shuttle and Mir
---------------

Atlantis is in VAB High Bay 1. The new BI-83 solid booster stack is
being assembled on Mobile Launch Platform 1 in VAB High Bay 3. However,
a problem during assembly means that they're going to have to
disassemble one part of one of the SRBs and try again; no word yet on
whether this will be a delay. Around Aug 1, external tank ET-82,
originally intended for STS-80, will be connected to the BI-83 stack. 
Atlantis will be dismounted from BI-82/ET-80 about the same time, and
connected to the BI-83/ET-82 stack on around Aug 13. ET-80 will then be
disconnected from BI-82, the SRB stack will be disassembled, cleaned and
reassembled (possibly getting a new BI designation?), and according to a
story on Bill Harwood's page will be used for STS-81. Launch of Atlantis
is now planned for around Sep 12.

Launch to Mir of a Progress cargo ship (vehicle No. 232) was originally
planned for Jul 25, but was scrubbed due to a tank pressurization
problem at T-45s. Another launch attempt will be made Jul 26.

Recent Launches
---------------

Atlas II flight AC-125 was launched from Complex 36 at Cape Canaveral
Air Station on Jul 25. Payload was an HS-601 comsat built by Hughes for
the US Navy, UHF Followon F7 (UHF F/O F7).  The UHF Followon comsats are
used for US Navy fleet communications. The Lockheed Martin Atlas II uses
a stretched Atlas first stage and a Centaur II liquid hydrogen/liquid
oxygen second stage. The Centaur makes two burns to deliver the HS-601
satellite to geostationary transfer orbit. The early UHF F/O satellites
were launched on Atlas I, but with the addition of an EHF (extremely
high frequency) communications package they were moved to the Atlas II.

Navstar SVN 40's apogee motor fired successfully prior to Jul 21 and on
Jul 23 it was in a 723.65 min, 20275 x 20368 km x 55.0 deg drift orbit.
It has been assigned the telemetry number PRN 10 and will be placed in
position E3 to begin service on Aug 12. Meanwhile, Navstar 20, launched
in 1990, was  retired last May 21; it was the first of the Block II GPS
satellites to leave service.

The two comsats launched by Ariane on Jul 9 are reaching their final
orbits. Arabsat 2A was on station at 26.0 deg E on Jul 23. Turksat 1C
was at 31.3 deg E on Jul 22, drifting 0.1 degree per day.

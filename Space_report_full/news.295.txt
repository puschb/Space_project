Time to catch up after my vacation...

Shuttle and Mir
---------------

The new cargo ship, Progress vehicle No. 232 (Progress M-32) was
successfully launched on Jul 31 by a Soyuz-U rocket. This was the first
successful launch of a Soyuz-U after two failures. Progress M-32  docked
with the Mir complex at the forward (-X) docking port at 2203 UTC on Aug
2. The old cargo ship, Progress M-31, undocked from the same port on Aug
1 at 1645 UTC and was deorbited over the south Pacific later that day.
Meanwhile, EO-22 crew commander Gennady Manakov has been taken ill and
removed from the Soyuz TM-24 crew due for launch this month (the exact
date is in question because of possible launch vehicle  problems). The
new crew is reportedly:

 Komandir (Commander)- Valeriy Korzun, RKA cosmonaut  (first flight)
 Bortinzhener (Flight Engineer)- Aleksandr Kaleri, RKA cosmonaut
   (flew on Soyuz TM-14 in 1992).
 Kosmonavt-issledovatel' (Researcher Cosmonaut) - Claudie Andre-Deshays,
   CNES (French Space Agency, first flight).
Currently aboard the station are the EO-21 crew of Yuriy Onufrienko,
Yuriy Usachyov and NASA astronaut Shannon Lucid. 

Note: A reader asked about the use of UTC (Coordinated Universal Time).
It's the precisely defined equivalent of the colloquial GMT (Greenwich
Mean Time), and is distinguished from other GMT type timescales
like TAI (atomic time), TT (Terrestrial dynamical time), etc. which
are different by under a minute. Since I don't often give times to
the closest second, you can just read `GMT' if you like.

The new external tank for STS-79, ET-81, has been connected to the solid
boosters; Atlantis was towed back from the Orbiter Processing Facility
to the Vehicle Assembly Building today (Aug 13) and will be added to the
new stack later today. The old stack will eventually be disassembled
for refurbishment.

Recent Launches
---------------

Another successful Ariane launch - Arianespace flight V90  placed two
European domestic comsats in orbit on Aug 8. Italsat F2 is a domestic
Ka-band comsat built by Alenia Spazio for the Italian Space Agency, and
is operated (and owned?) by Telecom Italia. The second satellite,
Telecom 2D, is a Matra Marconi Space Eurostar 2000 satellite, owned
jointly by France Telecom and the French Defense Ministry. V90 used an
Ariane 44L rocket, with 4 PAL strapon rockets, an L220 first stage, an
L33 second stage, and an H-10-3 third stage. The H-10-3 entered
geostationary transfer orbit, and then released Italsat F2 which was
mounted on a compartment called SMS (a nested bilingual acronym! SMS =
Stretched Mini SPELDA, SPELDA = Structure Portuese Enceinte de Lancement
Double Ariane, if I remember correctly. Way to go, ESA!). The SMS cover
was ejected followed by release of the Telecom 2D which was stored
underneath it. The two satellites entered a 260 x 36877 km x 5.3 deg
transfer orbit. Both have US-built R-4D liquid apogee engines to raise their
orbits to geostationary. Italsat F2 made its first burn on Aug 10,
raising perigee to 9200 km and lowering inclination to 2.4 deg.
Telecom 2D was still in its original orbit on Aug 11.

Note that Ariane flight V88 never happened; the press kit for the June launch
was V87, and for the July launch was V89. I assume that
the Ariane V501 flight has been retrospectively designated V88 (or V87)
- can anyone confirm?

The Atlas AC-125 launch was from pad 36A. The Progress M-23
launch was probably from pad 1.

NASA's DC-XA reusable suborbital rocket was destroyed  after a test
flight on Jul 31 when it toppled over after touchdown.

The Martians
------------

The McKay et al paper on alleged possible Martian fossil biota in
meteorite ALH84001 is available on the Web at 
<URL:http://www.eurekalert.org/E-lert/current/public_releases/mars/Prerelease.htm>.
I am intruiged but skeptical.

Historical Note
---------------

Inspection of launch photographs indicates that the launch of 1963 Jan 16
from Vandenberg was a Thor Agena B and not a Thor Agena D as most
records indicate. Can anyone confirm?

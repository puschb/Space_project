Shuttle and Mir
---------------

Soyuz TM-24 docked with Mir's front port at 1450:21 UTC on Aug 19. Soyuz
TM-23 is docked at the rear. Aboard Mir are EO-22 commander Valeriy
Korzun, EO-22 flight engineer Aleksandr Kaleri, EO-21 commander Yuriy
Onufrienko, EO-21 flight engineer Yuriy Usachyov, EO-21
cosmonaut-researcher Shannon Lucid, and EO-22 cosmonaut-researcher
Claudie Andre-Deshays.  Mir is in a 375 x 390 km x 51.6 deg orbit; the
Progress M-32 cargo ship, flying separately, is in a 375 x 392 km x 51.6
deg orbit.

OV-104 Atlantis and the STS-79 stack were rolled out to  pad 39A on Aug
20 in preparation for launch no earlier than Sep 12, with Sep 14 the
current plan. Atlantis will dock with the Mir station.  Meanwhile, the
old STS-79 stack is disassembled; stacking for STS-80 is due to begin
soon but according to the latest Shuttle status report, managers are
still discussing which booster set to use.

Recent Launches
---------------

The Fast Auroral Snapshot Explorer (FAST), a NASA-GSFC Small Explorer
(SMEX) mission, was launched on Aug 21 into an elliptical polar orbit by
an Orbital Sciences Corp.  Pegasus XL rocket. The L-1011 carrier plane
took off from Vandeberg at 0850 UTC and dropped the Pegasus at 0947 UTC.
The satellite was acquired in orbit by the Madrid ground station at 1118
UTC. FAST carries antennae to measure the electric field, magnetometers
to study the magnetic field, and electrostatic analysers and the TEAMS
time-of-flight/energy/angle mass spectrograph to study electrons and
ions. FAST will study particle acceleration processes with much higher
time resolution than previously attempted.
Orbit of FAST is 351 x 4165 km x 83.0 deg.

Errata: ADEOS launch time is 1996 Aug 17 at 0153 UTC; I mistyped
the name of Progress M-32 in the launch table.
I referred to the Korzun crew as EO-24 last week - oops! It is EO-22,
launched aboard Soyuz TM-24.

Zhongxing 7 was left in a 200 x 17227 km orbit at 27.2 deg inclination
when the CZ-3 third stage shut down 48 seconds too early.  The
HS-376 payload has a Star 30 solid apogee motor which could be fired
to raise the orbit, but it probably doesn't have enough fuel to make
it to geostationary.

ADEOS 1 has a problem with one of its 20N orbit adjust thrusters,
and the initial orbital adjustment is being made with the help
of smaller thrusters over the period Aug 24 to Sep 8.
Initial orbit was 799 x 820 km x 98.6 deg; on Aug 29 the
orbit was 800 x 810 km x 98.6 deg.

The Interbol-2 satellite was launched on Aug 29 from Plesetsk.
It is a Prognoz-M2 class satellite also known as Interbol Auroral
Probe. The Molniya-M rocket took off at 0522:00 UTC on Aug 29.
The four strapons that make up the first stage separated
at 0524, the second stage (Blok-A core) separated at 0526:52,
and the third stage shut down at approximately 0530:55 UTC.
At 0531:00 UTC the Blok-I third stage separated from the Blok-2BL fourth
stage carrying Interbol, leaving it in a 244 x 1192 km x 62.8 deg orbit.
One second later, the MU-SAT (MICROSATELITE) payload was  ejected.
MU-SAT is a small experimental payload from the Instituto Universitario
Aeronautico de Cordoba, Argentina. This is the second Argentine
satellite, following the amateur radio LUSAT.

At 0628 UTC (scheduled), the Blok-2BL stage began its burn and at 0631
UTC it separated, leaving the Interbol-2 (Prognoz-M2 article SO-M2 No.
513, built by NPO Lavochkin) in an elliptical orbit of 775 x 19210 km x
62.6 deg. Prognoz (SO-M) satellites are normally placed in much more
elliptical orbits with apogees around 200000 km, but this mission is
intended to study the aurora rather than the magnetosphere and solar
wind.

The S2-A Magion-5 subsatellite, built in the Czech Republic, was due to
separate from Interbol-2 to provide spatially resolved auroral
measurements. Confirmation of Magion-5 separation is still awaited.



Kosmodrom Baykonur
------------------

Sergey Voevodin reports that the designation of Baykonur is 
5-y Gosudarstvennyy Ispytatelnyy Kompleks
Ministerstva Oborony, 5th State Test Complex of the Ministry of Defence.
Its acronym is 5-y GIK or GIK-5, but note that here GIK stands for
Kompleks, not Kosmodrom as in the case of 1-y GIK at Plesetsk.

Erratum
-------

Sorry, the previous email version had a foolish error in it.
Kosmos-2333 was launched from Baykonur, not Plesetsk.

Shuttle and Mir
---------------

Soyuz TM-23 undocked from Mir on Sep 2 and landed safely in Kazakstan
with Yuri Onufrienko, Yuriy Usachyov and Claudie Andre-Deshays. This
concludes the French 'Cassiopee' mission. The spacecraft undocked at
0420:00 UTC, with a small sep burn at 0424:40 UTC. Deorbit was at
0647:20 UTC (preceding info from Vladimir Agapov via the seesat list).
The three modules separated at 0714:36 and the parachute deployed at
0726 UTC. The landing was at 0741:40 UTC according to CNES, 100 km SW of
Akmola.

Progress M-32 redocked with Mir on Sep 3 after several days
of free flight. It is docked at the rear port (+X) of the Kvant 37KE
module, while Soyuz TM-24 is docked at the front (-X) port of the
Mir complex.

STS-79 was rolled back from the pad to the VAB on Sep 4 to avoid
Hurricane Fran. It was in high bay 3, previously occupied by mobile
launch platform 3. The Shuttle was returned to Pad 39A on Sep 5,
with launch rescheduled for Sep 16. Hurricane Hortense, however,
is approaching...

Recent Launches
---------------

Kosmos-2333, launched on Sep 4, is a signals intelligence satellite
of the Tselina-2 series, built by KB Yuzhnoe of Ukraine. It was
launched on a Ukrainian-built Zenit-2 launch vehicle from the 
Baykonur spaceport and will be operated by the Russian Defense
Ministry.

Kosmos-2334 was launched on Sep 5 by a Kosmos-3M rocket. It is a Parus
navigation satellite in a 1000 km orbit inclined at 83 degrees. The
satellite is in the same plane as Kosmos-2327 launched earlier this
year. Parus satellites are built by AO Polyot of Omsk, who also 
are responsible for the Kosmos-3M booster.

A secondary payload with Kosmos-2334 is the UNAMSAT-b small satellite,
for the Autonomous University of Mexico (UNAM). It replaces a satellite
lost in a launch failure last year. The 10 kg satellite uses the 25cm
cubic AMSAT Microsat bus. It carries an experiment to determine the
velocity of meteors using radio doppler echo, and a communications data
relay for environmental sensors in remote locations.

The S2-A Magion-5 subsatellite, built in the Czech Republic, 
has separated from Interbol-Avroralniy-Zond. However, there were
initial problems deploying the solar panels. The Auroral Probe itself
has a larger nutation (4 degrees) than expected. The satellites
are in an elliptical orbit inclined at 63 degrees.

The International Maritime Satellite Organization's INMARSAT 3 
satellite was launched on Sep 6 by a Proton rocket from Baykonur (GIK-5)
in Kazakstan. This is the second commercial Proton launch, marketed by
International Launch Services for the Krunichev center which builds
Proton. It probably used the standard Proton-K rather than the new
Proton-AST used for the Astra launch (as described recently in the
Russian magazine Novosti Kosmonavtiki). The fourth stage on this flight
was the Blok-DM-1, yet another sub-variant of RKK Energiya's Blok-DM. If
I've translated the NK article correctly and read between the lines
appropriately, the intention was for a single burn of the DM-1 to place
Inmarsat in geostationary transfer orbit. By Sep 9 the Inmarsat was in
geosynchronous drift orbit. It is a GE4000 class spacecraft, which
carries a solid Star 37 kick motor, but the exact launch profile isn't
clear to me yet as GSFC hasn't released any Space Command elements for
the Blok-DM stage. Inmarsat 3 F2 is built by Lockheed Martin, with a
communications payload by Matra Marconi Space.

Lockheed Martin launched Atlas IIA flight AC-123 on Sep 8, carrying the
first Lockheed Martin Astro Space series A2100 satellite. The satellite,
GE-1, is owned by GE Americom and is a continuation of the old RCA/GE
Satcom series. GE-1 was placed in a supersynchronous transfer orbit of
191 x 56495 km x 25.0 deg. The A2100 satellites have a liquid
apogee engine (I don't know what type) and electric arcjet thrusters.
GE-1 has 24 C-band and 24 Ku-band transponders, and will replace
Satcom K1.

Arianespace launched an Ariane 42P on Sep 11 into geostationary transfer
orbit. The rocket carried the Echostar II communications satellite for
the Echostar Communications Corp. It is a Lockheed Martin Astro Space
Series 7000 satellite with 16 Ku-band transponders.

The Galileo Orbiter flew past Ganymede at a distance of 262 km from the
surface on Sep 6. The probe's third close approach to Jupiter was on Sep
7 at a distance of 10.7 Jovian radii.

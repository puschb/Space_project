Shuttle and Mir
---------------

Columbia is now on pad 39B awaiting the STS-80 launch, still scheduled
for Nov 8 pending resolution of worries about the SRBs. Korzun, Kaleri
and Blaha remain on Mir awaiting the Progress M cargo launch which has
been delayed.

Recent Launches
---------------

A meteoroid travelling in solar orbit bounced off the Earth's atmosphere
above New Mexico at 0200 UTC on Oct 4. It apparently entered a marginal
Earth orbit and reentered over the Pacific and impacted in California
almost one orbit later. NORAD numbers and international designations
only get given to *artificial* satellites, and even then usually only
to ones which make a complete orbit, so this natural object won't
get in the satellite catalogs.

China has launched an FSW-2 class recoverable satellite using a Chang
Zheng 2D rocket from the Jiuquan space center. The satellite is in a 170
x 323 km orbit at 63.0 deg inclination with an orbital period of 89.45
minutes.  The CZ-2D second stage is in a similar orbit. The FSW carries
cameras for Earth photography, and will return a capsule to Earth.

A Molniya-3 comsat, built by NPO Prikladnoi Mekhaniki for the Russian
government, was launched into elliptical orbit on Oct 24 from Plesetsk.

Launch time of Kosmos-2334 was 1247 UTC not 1347 UTC as I said earlier;
there was a confusion about summer time.

Launch of a Pegasus XL with the Argentine satellite SAC-B and the US
HETE satellite is currently scheduled for Oct 30.

Transit Symposium
-----------------

On Oct 18, the Applied Physics Lab (APL) hosted a symposium on the
Transit or Navy Navigation Satellite (NNS) system. Transit was one of
the first operational satellite systems, and has provided 24-hour
service since 1964, initially for Polaris submarines and more recently
for civilian users. It is being superseded by the Navstar global
positioning system. Individual satellites were remarkable for their 
longevity, many operating for over 10 years. Users measure the changing
Doppler shift of the satellite's radio signal as it rises and sets,
combined with knowledge of its orbit, to derive their position.

The symposium participants recalled Transit's technical achievements
including early work on orbiting frequency standards, gravity gradient
stabilization, the use of radio-isotope thermoelectric generators (RTG), and
on-board electronics to store the orbital ephemeris. The TRIAD satellite
launched in 1972 to test improvements, used a remarkable device with a
proof mass  floating inside a cavity in the spacecraft to enable
automatic correction for atmospheric drag. Small rocket motors fired to
adjust the satellite's orbit to keep the floating mass in the middle of
the cavity. Designers had to take into account the self-gravity of the
TRIAD satellite itself!

Although the navigation data stops being updated at the end of this
year,  the satellites will continue transmitting with NNS becoming NIMS,
the Navy Ionospheric Monitoring System. Researchers monitor the
distortion of the Transit  radio signals by the ionosphere to derive
maps of electron density versus height and position. The O-16 and O-17
satellites were modified for auroral and ionospheric research and were
not part of the navigation system.

Shuttle and Mir
---------------

Launch of STS-80 has been delayed while NASA figures out how the
solid motor nozzle insulation got eroded on the last flight.

Recent Launches
---------------

The SAC-B and HETE satellites were launched on Nov 4, but failed to
separate from the launch vehicle final stage because the third stage
battery failed.  The satellites were launched by an Orbital Sciences
Corp. Pegasus XL rocket. The L-1011 carrier plane took off from Wallops
Island, Virginia and dropped the Pegasus about 160 km out over the
Atlantic Ocean. All three stages fired successfully and delivered the
vehicle to the correct 95.07 min, 487 x 555 km x 38.0 deg orbit.  SAC-B
is an experimental satellite for the Argentine space agency CONAE with
solar flare and gamma ray burst instruments. It also carries CUBIC, a
Penn State experiment to survey the X-ray sky. HETE is an MIT-led NASA
satellite to localize gamma ray bursts. HETE is carried inside the Dual
Payload Attach Fixture on which SAC-B is mounted, so it's trapped and
was unable to deploy its solar panels. The satellite is now defunct.
SAC-B was able to deploy its solar panels, but the tumbling spacecraft
was unable to remain in sunlight enough to recharge the batteries and it
appears that SAC-B too is now lost, having operated for about 10 hours.

Mars Global Surveyor, NASA's probe to map the Martian surface and the
first of three Mars probes due for launch this window, was launched at
1700 UTC on Nov 7. The McDonnell Douglas Delta 7925 launch vehicle took
off from Cape Canaveral Launch Complex 17, with nine GEM solid motors
attached to the Thor-derived first stage. First stage separation was
four minutes into the flight, and the Delta second stage then ignited.
The second stage uses an AJ-10-118 engine and a structure derived from
the old Ablestar rockets used to launch the early Transits (see last
issue). The second stage cut off at 9 minutes into the flight, placing
MGS into a 185 x 185 km x 28.5 deg orbit. At 1741 UTC the second stage
ignited again for two minutes, and the vehicle entered a 173 x 4720 km x
28.5 deg orbit. The spin table on the second stage then began to rotate
at 60 rpm, spinning up the third stage and payload to stabilized them.
At 1744 the second stage separated and half a minute later the Thiokol
Star 48 solid motor on the PAM-D third stage ignited to enter an escape
trajectory. At 1752 the third stage deployed `yo-yo' masses on  long
wires to carry away the angular momentum and spin down the vehicle, and
then separated from the MGS probe which is now en route to Mars.
Meanwhile, the second stage was due to fire again to get rid of all
extra fuel and prevent it exploding later (this was a problem with
Delta stages in the 1970s).

MGS was built by Lockheed Martin Astronautics/Denver and is operated by
the Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena.  The MGS instruments are the Mars
Orbiter Camera, the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter, the Electron
Reflectometer, the Thermal Emission Spectrometer, the Mars Relay radio
system, and a magnetometer system. The Mars Relay system will be used to
relay data from future Mars landers to Earth. MGS also carries a
bipropellant liquid propulsion system, I believe related to the Cassini
design but using a British Leros 1b engine. MGS will reach Mars orbit in
Sep 1997 and use aerobraking to lower its initial elliptical orbit to a
450 km polar mapping orbit by Jan 1998.


Galileo made a close flyby of Callisto on Nov 4 at 1334 UTC at a distance
of 1118 km, and reached perijove on orbit 3 two days later. Next 
orbit it will fly by Europa, on Dec 19.

The FSW-2 Chinese recon satellite returned its recovery vehicle
safely to China on Nov 4.

Erratum: Delete the reference to APL satellite VE-4 in last issue's
table. Replace it with 5E-5, launched 1964 Dec 13.

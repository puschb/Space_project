Shuttle and Mir
---------------


The Space Shuttle Orbiter OV-102 Columbia was launched at
1955:50 UTC on Nov 19 from Kennedy Space Center. The SRBs
separated at 1957 UTC and main engine cutoff was at 2004 UTC.
The OMS 2 burn at around 2040 UTC placed Columbia in a circular
orbit.

Mission STS-80 carries the Orfeus astronomy satellite, the Wake Shield
Facility, and spacewalk equipment. A hold was called at 1952 UTC, T-31s
just prior to entering computer RSLS control because too much hydrogen
was in the aft compartment, but after a two minute pause permission was
given to continue.

The Orfeus satellite was deployed on Nov 20 at 0411 UTC. It carries an
ultraviolet telescope and spectrographs. Wake Shield Facility was
deployed on Nov 22  at 2038 UTC. OV-102, Orfeus and WSF are in a 91.6
min, 346 x 358 km x 28.5 deg orbit. Columbia retrieved
WSF at 0203 UTC on Nov 26 and berthed it in the payload bay at 0236 UTC.

The Progress M-33 cargo ship was successfully launched from Baykonur on
Nov 19 and docked with Mir on Nov 22 at 0101 UTC. Progress M-32 undocked
from Mir at 1944 UTC on Nov 20 and was deorbited over the Pacific at
2242 UTC.

Recent Launches
---------------

The Russian Mars-96 space probe mission failed to leave Earth orbit on
Nov 17. This failure is very sad news both for Mars
exploration and for the Russian space program.
  In last week's report I said that Mars-96 got into solar orbit,
based on announcements from the IKI web site which reported a successful
Blok-D-2 second burn and ADU solar orbit insertion burn. However it soon
emerged  that their claim of success was premature. The Blok-D-2 made a
successful first burn, entering a 160 km circular orbit. On the second
burn, possibly because of incorrect commands sent by the probe, it
burned for only a few seconds before shutting down, and the probe
remained in a lower perigee  Earth parking orbit of 145 x 171 km x 51.6
deg.  Mars-96 separated from the Blok-D-2 and fired its own ADU engine,
entering an elliptical 87 x 1500 km orbit. It made two revolutions of
the Earth in this orbit and reentered a few hours later, somewhere over
the South Pacific, at around 0132 UTC Nov 17. This piece, the M1 No. 520
probe with the two MAS landers and two Penetrator probes, was tracked by
Russian radars but missed by US Space Command.  The Blok-D-2 rocket
stage reentered over the South Pacific  at 31 S 96 W (US data) or 50.9 S
168 W (Russian data) a day later, at 0120 UTC Nov 18. The excitement on
Sunday about possible radioactive debris reentering over Australia or
Chile was apparently misplaced, since the payload had reentered the
previous day and Space Command was only tracking the rocket. [Some of
these details are thanks to Igor Lissov of Videocosmos]. There were four
small plutonium RTG batteries aboard the two MAS landers, with 15 g of
Pu-238 each. The two penetrator probes each carried five of the RTG
batteries. The RTGs were designed to survive reentry and the probability
of contamination is considered low. We don't know where the probe
reentered, since no-one (Russian or American) managed to determine a
precise orbit for it. Some estimates say it could be anywhere from the
south Pacific to the mid Atlantic.  Mass of Mars-96 was 6825 kg; mass of
the Blok-D-2 was 1900 kg with 12400 kg of fuel which was vented after
spacecraft separation.

Traditionally, Mars-96 (the prelaunch name) would have been designated
Mars-8  after a successful launch. It is not yet clear whether this
designation will be applied. In the old days, a failure like this would
have been given a Kosmos cover name.

Eutelsat's Hot Bird 2 communications satellite was launched by a
Lockheed Martin Astronautics Atlas IIA from Cape Canaveral on Nov 21.
The Atlas IIA was flight AC-124. Its Centaur IIA upper stage placed Hot
Bird 2 in geostationary transfer orbit of 168 x 35784 km x 23.8 deg. 
Hot Bird 2 is a Matra Marconi Space Eurostar 2000 Plus class satellite,
and carries Ku band transponders for television broadcasts to Europe.

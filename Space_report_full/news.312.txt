Shuttle and Mir
---------------

Progress M-33 will undock from Mir's Kvant module +X port on Feb 6, and
Soyuz TM-24 will undock from the Mir -X port on Feb 7, redocking at the
Kvant +X port shortly afterwards (info from Vladimir Agapov). Launch of
RKK Energiya's 7K-STM spacecraft No. 74 is scheduled for Feb 10. This
spacecraft will be named Soyuz TM-25 once reaching orbit, and will carry
the Russian EO-23 and German DLR Mir-97 crews to Mir. EO-23 commander is
Vasiliy Vasilevich Tsibliev, and flight engineer is Aleksandr Ivanovich
Lazutkin. Mir-97 astronaut-researcher is Reinhold Ewald. Currently on
board the Mir station are EO-22 crew Valeriy Korzun and Aleksandr
Kaleri, and NASA-4 crewmember Jerry Linenger. After the return of Soyuz
TM-24 to Earth at the beginning of March, the crew will be Tsibliev,
Lazutkin and Linenger. Launch of Soyuz TM-25 will be carried out by an
11A511U (Soyuz-U) launch vehicle from the Baykonur spaceport (GIK-5) in
Kazakstan. Tsibliev was selected for the Russian Air Force astronaut
detachment in 1987 and first flew on Soyuz TM-17. Lazutkin joined NPO
Energiya's civilian astronaut team in 1991 and has not flown before.
Ewald was selected for the German astronaut team in 1990. and was backup
for the Soyuz TM-14 mission in 1992. Soyuz TM-25 will dock at Mir's -X
port on Feb 12. Soyuz TM-24 will undock from Kvant +X in March and land
in Kazakstan; Progress M-33 will remain in orbit probably until March
and then be deorbited over the Pacific.

Launch of Shuttle mission STS-82 is scheduled for Feb 11. OV-103
Discovery wil be launched from pad 39A at Kennedy Space Center and will
rendezvous with and capture the Hubble Space Telescope (HST).
Discovery's payload bay contains:
 
 RMS:         Remote Manipulator System No. 301
 Bay 1:       Airlock Tunnel Adapter
 Bay 2:       Orbiter Docking System 
 Bay 4-5:     SAC Second Axial Carrier
 Bay 6 Keel:  Camera
 Bay 7-8:     ORUC Orbital Replacement Unit Carrier
 Bay 10 Port: APC (Adaptive Payload Carrier) with MFR, Manipulator Foot Restraint
 Bay 11:      FSS  Flight Support System
 Bay 13 Port: APC with PFR, Portable Foot Restraint

The Orbiter Docking System was added to Discovery after its last refit,
so that the Orbiter can support Mir and Space Station missions.
Astronauts will exit through the ODS airlock into the payload bay. A
Tool Stowage Assembly (TSA) is mounted on the outside of the ODS,
containing tools for the spacewalkers to use. The SAC is the same device
formerly called Solar Array Carrier which  flew on mission STS-61. On
this mission it carries gyros and other replacement components for HST,
as well as the NICMOS science instrument. The ORUC is a Spacelab Pallet
and carries the STIS science instrument and a replacement FGS 1 (Fine
Guidance Sensor 1). The Flight Support System is a docking ring for HST;
Discovery will capture HST with its manipulator arm and lower it onto
the FSS. FSS first flew on the Solar Max Repair Mission in 1984.

STIS, the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph, will replace both GHRS
(the Goddard High Res Spectrograph) and FOS (the Faint Object
Spectrograph). The big difference is that STIS has two-dimensional
detectors, giving you one axis of wavelength (spectrum) and another axis
of position. This means that you can get a background spectrum  at the
same time as your source spectrum, so you can study faint objects more
easily, and you can study how a spectrum changes across a spatially
extended object like a galaxy. STIS has three detectors, two
ultraviolet-sensitive microchannel plate arrays and one optical CCD
camera.

NICMOS, the Near Infrared Camera and Multi-Object Spectrometer, marks
HST's entry into infrared astronomy. The HST mirror has always been able
to collect near infrared light, it just didn't have any cameras which
could register those photons. NICMOS covers the 0.8 to 2.5 micron
spectral range; parts of this range are covered by the I, J, H and K
atmospheric windows in the optical but you need to go into space to get
an uninterrupted view of this crucial chunk of spectrum.

Crew of STS-82 are Ken Bowersox (Commander), Scott Horowitz (Pilot),
Mark Lee (Payload Commander )and Mission Specialists Joe Tanner, Steve
Hawley, Greg Harbaugh, and Steve Smith.

The first EVA will be carried out by Lee and Smith. They will replace
the GHRS spectrograph with STIS, and then replace FOS with NICMOS. EVA
2, by Harbaugh and Tanner, will involve replacing FGS 1 and adding new
electronics. EVA 3, by Lee and Smith, will replace a Data Interface Unit
(DIU-2), a data recorder, and a reaction wheel assembly (RWA-1).
Harbaugh and Tanner, on EVA 4, will replace the solar array drive
electronics  (SADE-2) and magnetometer (MSS) covers. After the
spacewalks are complete, Discovery will boost HST's orbit and then
release it. The existing imaging instruments (WFPC-2 and FOC) are not
affected by the servicing mission (we hope!) and will resume
observations withing a few weeks; the new instruments will take several
months to go into regular service.

Steve Hawley (1978 group )was former chief Scientist Astronaut, and flew
on the original STS-31R HST deployment mission. He had left the
astronaut corps, but returned specially for this STS-82 mission. 
Bowersox was part of the 1987 group of astronauts, and was pilot on the
first HST repair mission. This is his fourth flight and his second
command. Greg Harbaugh (1987 group) flew on the first Mir docking
mission and made a training EVA on mission STS-54. Mark Lee (1984 group)
test flew the SAFER backpack on STS-64; the other two spacewalkers are
new to the experience; Smith and Tanner were in the 1992 astronaut
group, as is pilot Horowitz.

Recent Launches
---------------

Ariane flight V93 was successfully launched from the Centre Spatiale
Guyanais on Jan 30. The third stage of the launch vehicle entered
geostationary transfer orbit, releasing two communications satellites.
GE 2 is the second Lockheed Martin Missiles and Space A2100 series
comsat and is owned by GE Americom. It has 24 C-band and 24 Ku-band
transponders and will provide communications services in North America.
Nahuel 1A is a Dornier/Aerospatiale Spacebus 2000 class comsat for the
Argentine NAHUELSAT communications company, providing direct TV services
to all of Latin America with 18 Ku-band transponders. The two satellites
both carry liquid apogee engines which will be used to raise their
orbits to geosynchronous altitude over the next few weeks. V93 placed
the payloads in a 637.0 min, 241 x 36049 km x 7.5 deg orbit. By Feb 1 GE
2 had raised perigee to 3814 x 35818 km x 4.6 deg, and Nahuel was at
13893 x 35879 km x 1.9 deg. On Feb 5, Nahuel was in a  35491 x 35899 km
x 0.1 deg orbit over 73.6W, drifting 1 deg per day. GE 2 was in a 35741
x 35824 km x 0.1 deg orbit over 82.4W according to Space Command, but
those orbital elements may be a search orbit rather than an actual
observation.

I'm not sure if the GPS IIR payload lost on Jan 17 was production
vehicle Number 2 (SVN 42) or Number 3 (SVN 43); if anyone knows, please
email me.

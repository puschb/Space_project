Shuttle and Mir
---------------

The crew swap on the Mir station is underway amid much reparking of
spaceships. The Progress M-33 robot cargo ship undocked from the +X axis
of Mir at 1213:56 UTC on Feb 6 and began independent orbital flight in a
 377 x 395 km x 51.65 deg orbit. On Feb 7 at 1628:01 the Mir crew of
Korzun, Kaleri and Linenger undocked the Soyuz TM-24 ferry from the
front docking port (-X), flew it around to the far side of the complex
and redocked at the +X port at 1651:27 UTC. The new ferry ship Soyuz
TM-25 was launched from Kazakstan on Feb 10 at 1409:30 UTC. The 11A511U
launch vehicle placed the spacecraft in a 51.6 degree orbit. On Feb 11
the orbit was 262 x 311 km x 51.65 deg, while Mir is in a 378 x 394 km x
51.65 deg orbit. Crew of Soyuz TM-25 are Vasiliy Tsibliev (callsign
'Sirius'), Aleksandr Lazutkin, and Reinhold Ewald. After several more
rendezvous burns, Soyuz TM-25 docked with Mir at the -X port on Feb 12
at 1551:13 UTC. (Thanks for detailed info from Chris van den Berg and
Vladimir Agapov).

Space Shuttle Orbiter OV-103 Discovery was launched on Feb 11 at 0855:17
 UTC on mission STS-82. It will rendezvous with the Hubble Space
Telescope on Feb 13, and astronauts will spacewalk to install the NICMOS
and STIS science instruments. After the OMS 2 burn Discovery was in a
350 x 579 km x 28.5 deg orbit; later on Feb 11 perigee was raised to 480
km and on Feb 12 it was in a 576 x 584 km orbit. HST is in a 589 x 598
km x 28.5 deg orbit. The Discovery astronauts have checked out operation
of the robot arm and are closing in on their target.

Recent Launches
---------------

The Japanese Institute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS) has
launched the MUSES B satellite early on Feb 12. (1350 JST or 1358 JST
according to different reports). It has been renamed 'Haruka', which
means 'far-away'. Congratulations to the ISAS team!  Haruka is the space
segment of the VSOP (VLBI Space Observatory Programme), and will unfurl
an 8-meter radiotelescope antenna to make joint observations with ground
based radio observatories, simulating a telescope larger than the Earth.
Haruka carries detectors operating at 1.6, 5 and 22 GHz, and will be
able to make radio images with very high spatial resolution,
permitting precise measurements of quasar jets and galactic maser
sources. MUSES B is the second Mu Space Engineering Satellite; the
first was the MUSES A (Hiten) probe which pioneered use of advanced orbital
dynamics and aerobraking.

This was the first launch of the Japanese ISAS agency's three stage
solid fuel M-V (Mu-5) rocket. M-V-1 was launched from the Kagoshima
Space Center (I don't know if the launch pad has a specific
designation). The M-14 first stage separated 25s after launch, followed
by the M-24 second stage at T+3min:33s.  The M-34 third stage continued
the ascent, separating at 5min 39sec after spinning up the payload
section. The KM-V1 solid kick motor ignited to raise apogee, and
separated 8 minutes after launch to leave Haruka in a 233 x 21527 km x
31.2 deg orbit. On-board RCS burns will raise the perigee over the next
week. The KM-V1 motor (1997-05B) is in a 230 x 21452 km x 31.3 deg
orbit. The M-34 stage may have reached orbit with a similar perigee and
a lower apogee, but it has not yet been cataloged by Space Command.
All four of the stages involved in this launch had never flown before,
so this was a crucial test for the ISAS launch vehicle group.

The Haruka satellite is also given the  English acronym HALCA (Highly
Advanced Laboratory for Communications and Astronomy). Each ISAS
satellite has had a prelaunch English name (like MUSES B) and a
postlaunch Japanese name (like Haruka). Unfortunately, starting with
ASTRO D, ISAS also began to assign  homophonic 'English equivalents' of
the Japanese name and use only these in English publications, thus ASTRO
D is widely known as ASCA (Advanced Satellite for Cosmology and
Astrophysics) rather than Asuka, its Japanese equivalent. This is
presumably because ISAS scientists got quite reasonably fed up with
Americans completely mangling the Japanese names of their satellites.
However, I find the English homophones ugly, and HALCA in particular is
kind of dumb - so I plan to use the Haruka name. 

The GPS satellite lost on Jan 17 was SVN (Space Vehicle No.) 42, the
second GPS IIR production satellite. It would have used the identifier
PRN 12 if it had been successful. (Info from Richard Langley). Prior to
the accident, the schedule foresaw the next launch as SVN 38, the last
Block IIA satellite, followed by SVN 43 (GPS IIR No. 3).

Despite my comment last week, the GE 2 orbit I quoted was a true orbital
measurement, according to my sources. Ariane V93's final stage entered 
a 210 x 35800 km x 7.0 deg orbit before deploying the two satellites and
the Mini-Spelda adapter cover, and then performed an avoidance maneuver
to enter a 236 x 36066 km orbit. GE Americom's GE 2 is now on station at
82.4W and Nahuelsat's Nahuel 1A is stationary at 72.2W.

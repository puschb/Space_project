Shuttle and Mir
---------------


The Mir crew of Korzun, Kaleri, Ewald, Tsibliev, Lazutkin and Linenger
continued their mission on the complex in late February. On Feb 23 at
1935 UTC a fire broke out in a lithium perchlorate  cartridge in the
Kvant module used to generate extra oxygen on Mir, filling the complex
with smoke. Korzun and Kaleri used extinguishers to  fight the fire
which was extinguished after 90 seconds; the heavy smoke persisted for 
about five minutes and the crew wore gas masks for two and a half hours.
Now the crew are having difficulty generating sufficient oxygen
for the life support system. (Details from Chris van den Berg and NASA).

Korzun, Kaleri and Ewald undocked from Mir in the Soyuz TM-24 spaceship
at 0324 UTC on Mar 2 and landed at 0644 UTC near Arkaylk in Kazakstan.

The Progress M-33 cargo ship, which has been orbiting separately from
Mir since Feb 6, failed to redock with Mir on Mar 4. It will be
deorbited. Launch of Progress M-34 is scheduled for early April.

Recent Launches
---------------

The first Titan 4B was launched successfully from Cape Canaveral on Feb
23. The vehicle, K-24, is the first to use Alliant SRMU solid rocket
motors replacing the UTC solid motors which have propelled Titan 3 and 4
vehicles since 1965. K-24 carried a Boeing Inertial Upper Stage (serial
number not known yet). The two stage IUS solid upper stage was
due to place the payload in geostationary orbit.

The K-24 payload was Defense Support Program DSP F-18, a TRW-built
early warning satellite with an infrared telescope for detecting
missile launches.

The International Telecommunications Satellite Organization's first
Intelsat 8 satellite, Intelsat 801, was launched on Mar 1. The satellite
was launched by Arianespace's Ariane 44P rocket on mission V94. The
Intelsat 8 satellites are built by  Lockheed Martin/East Windsor and use
the Series 7000 spacecraft bus. The Series 7000 uses either the Royal
Ordnance Leros 1 or the TRW 454N  LAE for apogee propulsion,
I don't know what's on the Intelsat 8, though.

The first launch from Russia's far eastern Svobodniy cosmodrome (51.2 N
128.0 E) was a success. A Start-1 rocket placed the Zeya satellite in
sun-synchronous orbit. The Zeya (also known as Mozhaets) satellite was
designed by the students of the Mozhaiskiy military space engineering
academy and built at NPO-PM. The launch vehicle is the four-stage
Start-1, using a mobile launch platform at Svobodniy. It will be used
for navigation and geodesy.

The MSX satellite's solid hydrogen cooled IR telescope completed
operations on Feb 26.

I've updated the geostationary launch list at

Shuttle and Mir
---------------

OV-102 Columbia is in the Vehicle Assembly Building and has been
connected to the external tank and solid boosters for flight STS-94, the
reflight of the Microgravity Science Lab. OV-103 Discovery is being
prepared for the STS-85 science flight; OV-104 Atlantis, just back from
the STS-84 Mir flight, is to be turned around for another Mir docking on
STS-86; and OV-105 Endeavour is beginning preparations for STS-89, the
Mir docking fight after that.

Meanwhile, Vasiliy Tsibliev, Aleksandr Lazutkin and Mike Foale
continue operations on the Mir complex. The next flight to Mir
is the Progress M-35 robot cargo tanker/supply ship.


Recent Launches
---------------

Arianespace successfully launched an Ariane 44LP on Jun 3. It placed two
comsats into a 201 x 35745 km x 7.0 deg transfer orbit. Inmarsat III F-4
is a Series 4000 class comsat built by Lockheed Martin/East Windsor for
the International Maritime Satellite Organization. It will provide
L-band mobile communications services to ships and aircraft. Insat 2D is
a comsat for the Indian Space Research Organization. 

Kosmos-2344, launched on Jun 6, is a new 11F664 type Russian military
satellite in an unusual medium altitude orbit of 1509 x 2747 km x 63.4
deg.  This is rather high for an optical observation satellite, and it
may be doing electronic intelligence or radar imaging. The Proton-K
rocket has rarely been used to launch low orbit military Kosmos
satellites; the exceptions are Kosmos-1603 and Kosmos-1656 in 1984-85,
which were Tselina-2 SIGINT satellites launched on Proton because the
Zenit-2 rocket was not yet operational. On the new launch, the 8S812
third stage of the Proton-K entered a 135 x 148 km x 64.8 deg parking
orbit. The Blok DM-2M upper stage ignited for its first burn to enter a
transfer orbit of about 200 x 2490 km x 64.6 deg. Before this first
burn, a cylindrical adapter probably separated from it but reentered
before being cataloged. As the Blok DM-2M reached apogee, two SOZ liquid
ullage rockets fired to force DM-2M propellant to the bottom of the
tanks; the two SOZ were then jettisoned as the DM-2M reignited for its
second burn, entering a 1506 x 2744 km x 63.4 deg orbit. The DM-2M then
separated from the 11F664 payload (Kosmos-2344) and from one other
object, which may be either a payload adapter or a cover for the payload
instruments (lens cap, antenna cover, etc). The 63.4 deg inclination is
chosen so that cos i = sqrt(2/5), which  minimizes precession of the
orbital plane due to the non-spherical shape of the Earth. Molniya
comsats, Oko early warning satellites, and US elliptical orbit signals
intelligence satellites also use this inclination.

The Kosmos-2343 recon satellite launched in May is in a 216 x 338 km x
64.9 deg orbit.

On June 4, Thor 2 was approaching its station at 0.6 deg West longitude
drifting 0.2 deg per day. Telstar 5 was on station at 97 deg West.

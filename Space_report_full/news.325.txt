Apologies for the delay in this issue.

Shuttle and Mir
---------------

The robot cargo ship Progress M-34 undocked from Mir at 1022 UTC on Jun
24 to perform a redocking test using recently developed remote-control
procedures which are replacing the old automatic systems that Russia can
no longer afford to buy from Ukraine. At around 0918 UTC on Jun 25, Mir
commander Tsibliev was remotely commanding the approach of Progress to
the Kvant (37KE) module when, for reasons that remain unclear, the
Progress went off course and collided with a solar array on the Spektr
module and then the module itself. A large hole was made in the solar
panel, and one of Spektr's radiators was badly buckled.  A small breach
in Spektr's hull appears to have been made and the module began to
depressurize. This was not a slow leak - apparently the crew heard a
hissing sound and felt their ears pop. They closed the hatch on the core
module transfer section that leads to Spektr. The Spektr module is now
fully depressurized. It remains docked to Mir with its docking hatch
open. The electrical connection between Spektr's solar panels and the
main station was broken off, also cutting off the power supply from the
solar panels on the Kristall module. The crew of Mir are Vasiliy
Tsibliev, Aleksandr Lazutkin, and Mike Foale. (It has been noted that
Tsibliev was also driving on the only previous documented orbital
fender-bender, when he banged Soyuz TM-17 into Mir in Jan 1994).

The Progress M-34 cargo ship is at a safe distance and is under control.
It will be deorbited on Jun 26. Many details of this incident are thanks
to Igor Lissov of Videocosmos Inc/Novosti Kosmoavtiki.

Meanwhile, it has emerged that the fire on Mir on February 23 was much
more serious than earlier reported. It lasted 14 minutes and metre-long
flames of burning lithium perchlorate in the Kvant module blocked
the way to one of the two Soyuz spaceships.

OV-102 Columbia was moved to pad 39A on Jun 11 in preparation for launch
on mission STS-94.

Erratum
-------

Oops - I misspoke last issue. The 63.4 degree 'magic' inclination stops
precession of the  perigee around the orbit, not the precession of the
orbit plane with respect to an inertial frame. In other words, if you
have a really elliptical orbit and you launch so that the apogee is way
up north and the perigee over the southern hemisphere, then if you wait
a few months the orientation of the orbit will have rotated within the
orbital plane so that the perigee is now at the equator, or eventually
in the north... unless you use the magic inclination which locks in the
direction of the orbit and keeps the apogee in the north (or wherever
you put it). Have I confused you all properly now?


Recent Launches
---------------

China launched a satellite on Jun 10 using a CZ-3 (Long March 3) rocket
from Xichang. The CZ-3 third stage and satellite entered a 206 x 35987
km x 28.4 deg orbit. The satellite later fired an apogee motor to enter
geosynchronous orbit. The payload is the Feng Yun 2 geostationary
weather satellite. (There's some confusion as to whether this was a CZ-3
or CZ-3A rocket but the Xinhua news report says it was a CZ-3.)

Seven more Iridium comsats were launched on Jun 18 by a Proton from
Baykonur. The three-stage 8K82K Proton-K rocket placed the payload and
fourth stage in a 170 x 170 km x 73 deg parking orbit. The Proton-K
third stage may have reentered without being cataloged. The RKK Energiya
Blok DM-5 fourth stage made an inital burn to 170 x 516 km x 73 deg,
followed by a second burn to raise perigee and change inclination to
a 504 x 523 km x 86.4 deg orbit. It then dispensed the seven Iridium
satellites, and made a third burn to place itself on a suborbital
trajectory (to avoid leaving space debris around). The seven satellites
will use their own on-board propulsion to raise their orbits.


The Intelsat 802 comsat was launched on Jun 25 by an Ariane 44P rocket.
It will replace the Intelsat 701 satellite at the standard Pacific Ocean
Region slot of 174 deg E.

Galileo made a 415 km flyby of Callisto on Jun 25.

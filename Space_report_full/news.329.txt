Shuttle and Mir
---------------

Soyuz TM-26 was launched at 1536 UTC on Aug 5 from Kazakstan. Crew are
Anatoliy Solov'yov and Pavel Vinogradov. On Aug 6 it was in a 241 x 279
km x 51.6 deg orbit compared with Mir's 386 x 392 km x 51.6 deg orbit.
The ship docked with Mir's Kvant module at 1702 UTC on Aug 7. The crew
took over manual control in the final phase, which is not uncommon.
Progress M-35 undocked from Mir at 1146 UTC on Aug 6 to clear the
docking port. Soyuz TM-25 remains at the front docking port.

Discovery (OV-103) was launched at 1441:00 UTC on Aug 7 from Kennedy
Space Center on mission STS-85. It entered a 289 x 300 km x 57.0 deg
orbit. Crew of Discovery are Curt Brown
(commander), Kent Rominger (pilot), Jan Davis (payload commander), Bob
Curbeam, Stephen Robinson and Bjarni Tryggvason (mission specialists).
Tryggvason is a Canadian Space Agency astronaut, and the first person
born in Iceland to fly in space. Discovery's payload bay contains the
following cargoes:
Bay 1-2: External Airlock
Bay 5:   MPESS (Multi Purpose Experiment Support Structure) with
         the MFD (Manipulator Flight Demonstration) payload from the
         Japanese space agency. This features tests of a 'robot hand' to go on 
         the end of the robot arm being developed for the Japanese
         space station module.
Bay 6 Port sidewall: A small carrier with the ITEPC radiation dose counter.
Bay 7:   MPESS with the TAS-01 payload (Technology Applications and Science)
         from NASA-Goddard's Hitchhiker-M program. 
         TAS-01 has a bunch of GAS cans with science
         experiments, including the second flight of the Shuttle Laser
         Altimeter and an instrument to measure the absolute bolometric flux
         of the Sun.
Bay  9:  ASTRO-SPAS, a free flying platform built by Germany's DASA, carrying
         the CRISTA-SPAS atmospheric science payload on its second mission.
        CRISTA-SPAS was deployed by the RMS arm at 2227 UTC on Aug 7.
Bay 11 Port sidewall: a small carrier with the ERPCL transmitter/receiver
         which communicates with SPAS during its flight.
Bay 12:  MPESS with the IEH-2 Hitchhiker payload from Goddard. The International
        Extreme Ultraviolet Hitchhiker is a joint NASA-Italian astronomy
        payload. Its two main instruments are the UVSTAR ultraviolet spectrograph
        and the SEH solar extreme ultraviolet instrument.
        The MPESS also carries the GLO-5 and GLO-6 airglow studies
        and the Data-Chaser technology experiment.
        UVSTAR's main objective is to study the extreme UV emissions from the
        Io plasma torus around Jupiter.
Bay 13 Starboard sidewall: GABA (GAS Beam Adapter) with two GAS experiment
        cans, G-572 and G-745. G-572 has experiments from Bellermine College
        and Utah State, and G-745 has student experiments from Mayo High School.

Wendy Lawrence has been pulled off the STS-86 crew and replaced
by David Wolf, who will now be the person replacing Mike Foale on
Mir. Wolf, unlike Lawrence, is trained in the Orlan EVA suit and
so could support spacewalks to repair the Spektr module.


Recent Launches
---------------

A GPS satellite was launched on Jul 23. I understand this is IIR
satellite 3, or Navstar SVN 43. It is the second IIR satellite to be
launched, and the first to reach orbit successfully. The Delta second
stage entered a 196 x 1339 km x 37.7 deg orbit; the PAM-D third stage 
reached 187 x 20363 km x 39 deg and separated from the GPS. The GPS's
internal Thiokol Star 37 apogee motor fired by Jul 25 to place SVN 43 in
a 19876 x 20223 km x 54.9 deg operating orbit; on board thrusters
will make the final adjustments.

The Superbird C satellite was launched on Jul 28 by a Lockheed Martin
Atlas IIAS. The satellite is an HS-601 comsat built by Hughes for Space
Communications Co. of Japan. The Atlas used the supersynchronous
transfer orbit technique again, delivering Superbird into a 333 x 91062
km x 25.3 deg highly eccentric orbit. The onboard Marquardt R-4D-12
engine will be used to lower the apogee and raise perigee to reach a
circular geostationary orbit.

Orbital Sciences launched a Pegasus XL on Aug 1, placing the OrbView-2
satellite in orbit for their OrbImage subsidiary. Orbview-2, formerly
known as SeaStar, will provide oceanographic data under contract from
NASA. The L-1011 carrier plane took off from Vandenberg at around 1915
UTC and dropped the rocket over the Pacific at 2020 UTC. The satellite
carries the SeaWIFS imaging sensor. Initial orbit of Orbview-2
was 294 x 311 km x 98.3 deg.

The latest Iridium satellites have started to raise their orbits
from their initial 620 x 650 km ones.
         Jul 28       Aug  6
 SV015  695 x 705     773 x 780 x 86.4
 SV017  667 x 671     773 x 780 x 86.4
 SV018  665 x 673     773 x 779 x 86.4
 SV020  667 x 671     772 x 782 x 86.4
 SV021  627 x 645     626 x 656 x 86.3
This confirms that SV021 is the failed satellite, which has remained
in its initial orbit. The Delta second stage lowered its orbit
after dispensing the satellites and is in a 266 x 620 km orbit.

An Ariane 44P, flight V98, was launched on Aug 8 from Kourou carrying a
Space Systems/Loral FS-1300 class satellite, PAS-6. PAS 6 is owned by
Panamsat (which recently merged with Hughes Galaxy) and will provide
direct broadcast services to South America. Launch mass is 3420 kg, dry
mass is 1285 kg,and payload includes 36 Ku-band transponders. The Ariane
placed its payload in a 181 x 37143 km x 7.1 deg transfer orbit.
PAS 5 will be launched later this month by a Proton from Baykonur.

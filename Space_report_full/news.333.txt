Historical Space Archive
------------------------

Over the past year I have been digitizing an archive of historical
launch vehicle photos. Peter Hunter generously loaned me his photo
collection, which includes many previously unpublished photographs of
early United States launch vehicles, including some recently
declassified ones. I hope to continue adding to this archive over the
coming years, but it's now substantial enough to warrant making it
publicly available. You can explore this archive at
http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~jcm/space/book/lv.html. In the coming
months, I'm also planning to complete a list of all orbital
launches and a comprehensive Shuttle cargo history - stay tuned.


Shuttle and Mir
---------------

A Russian commission of enquiry has formally blamed EO-23 crewmembers
Vasiliy Tsibliev and Aleksandr Lazutkin, as well as flight controllers,
for the Jun 25 accident in which the Progress M-34 cargo ship collided
with the Mir complex. A spacewalk by Solov'yov and Foale to locate the
punctures in Spektr is scheduled for Sep 6; the airlock is about to be
depressurized as I write this.

Recent Launches
---------------

A Chang Zheng 2C rocket built by the China Academy of Launch Vehicle
Technology was orbited from the Taiyuan polar orbit launch site at 37.8N
111.5E on Sep 1 at 1400:15.7 UTC. It carries two dummy Iridium
satellites (Iridium Mass Frequency Simulators), in preparation for the
start of regular Iridium launches from Taiyuan. This is the first CZ-2C
from Taiyuan, earlier CZ-2C missions were from Jiuquan and previously
Taiyuan was used for the CZ-4. This version of the CZ-2C is believed to
have a somewhat lengthened second stage compared to the usual version.
As far I can tell, the Iridium MFS satellites were probably built by
Motorola/Chandler but are owned by China Aerospace Corp. Mass is about
650 kg per satellite. The satellites are inert, but are built to
reproduce the mass distribution and oscillation frequencies of a true
Iridium satellite during launch, to provide a realistic test of the
CZ-2C launch vehicle.

The second stage of the CZ-2C entered a 215 x 638 km x 86.2 deg orbit 5
min after launch. The new Smart Dispenser (SD) stage with the two
satellites attached  separated 5 min later, and its solid motor ignited
at apogee 48 min after launch, to enter a 623 x 633 km x 86.3 deg orbit
from which the two mass simulators were dispensed at around 1450 UTC.
Another motor on the SD ignited four minutes later to deorbit the stage,
avoiding cluttering up Earth orbit with debris. The solid motor is
probably a Chinese motor built by CALT/Shaanxi.

Space Command has redesignated the objects in the launch since they
were first cataloged (actually, the designations seem to still be
somewhat in flux:)
 Originally       Now     Object
   48A           48C     CZ-2C stage 2 in transfer orbit
   48B,48F       48B,48A Dummy Iridium satellites in circular orbit
   48C           48F     Debris in transfer orbit
   48D,E         48D,E   Debris (launch adapter?) in transfer orbit, decaying fast.
The SD stage was deorbited before being cataloged, in keeping with
Iridium's policy of having as few objects adding to the orbital
debris population as possible. Twelve more Iridium satellites are
due to be launched this month, seven on a Proton and five on a Delta.

Meanwhile, sources report that the successful launch of a CZ-3B rocket
last month, which orbited the Agila 2 satellite, may have been marred by
a downrange accident. The first stage of the CZ-3B impacted in Hunan
province  1000 km downrange from Xichang, and allegedly caused property
damage in a village, although I understand that this has not been
acknowledged by China Great Wall Industry Corp or China Aerospace Corp.
There have also been rumours of casualties but those are denied by the
Chinese authorities.

Ariane flight V99, on Sep 2, launched two satellites into geostationary
transfer orbit. Hot Bird 3 is a high power television broadcasting
satellite for EUTELSAT, the European Telecommunications Satellite
Organization, and Meteosat 7 is a weather satellite for EUMETSAT
(European Meteorological Satellite Organization) built by Aerospatiale.
Hot Bird 3 is built by Matra Marconi Space (Toulouse) and is a Eurostar
2000+ satellite with a Marquardt R-4D apogee engine. Meteosat 7 is the
first Meteosat Transition Programme satellite (MTP-1), using the same
design as the Meteosat Operational Programme (MOP) satellites Meteosat 4
to 6.  It carries a three channel radiometer with 2.5km resolution.
Launch mass was 750 kg; it has a solid Mage 1 apogee motor. The first
Meteosat weather satellite was launched in 1977.

GE Americom's GE 3 communications satellite was launched on Sep 4 by a
Lockheed Martin Atlas IIAS, flight AC-146. The satellite has C and Ku
band transponders for domestic communications relay and broadcasting. It
was built by Lockheed Martin Telecommunications and is an A2100 series
satellite like its two precursors. The satellite was placed in a mildly
supersynchronous transfer orbit of 309 x 43913 km x 19.1 deg; its Royal
Ordnance Leros apogee engine will circularize the orbit.

The Cassini launch to Saturn, originally scheduled for Oct 6, will be
delayed because overpressurized air hoses at the launch pad blew away
some insulation on the Huygens Titan entry probe. They are still
expecting to launch within the window, which extends to Nov 4.

Shuttle and Mir
---------------

Solov'yov and Foale failed to locate any punctures in Spektr during an
otherwise successful spacewalk on Sep 6. The hatch of the Kvant-2 module
was opened at 0107 UTC and closed at 0707 UTC. The spacewalkers probably
used the new Orlan-M spacesuits (one report claims Foale used the M and
Solov'yov the older DMA version). They used the Strela crane to transfer
from the Kvant-2 to Spektr, and Solovyov cut away insulation to inspect
the area around the radiator and solar panel mounting.

Recent Launches
---------------

Seven more Iridium satellites were launched on Sep 14. The Krunichev
Proton-K launch vehicle took off from Baykonur at 0136 UTC and its third
stage entered a 170 x 170 km x 72.6 deg orbit at around 0146 UTC (by
1100 UTC this had decayed to a 124 x 143 km orbit and reentry has
probably already occurred). The Energiya Blok DM-5 (17S40) upper stage
made two burns to a 516 x 516 km x 86.6 deg parking orbit where the
seven satellites were dispensed around 0304 UTC. The DM-5 then made a
third burn to deorbit itself. The satellites will use their own
propulsion systems to raise to their final orbits. This is the third use
of the DM-5 stage, following Kosmos-2344 and the previous Iridium Proton
launch. Unlike DM-1, DM-3 and DM-4, which are minor modifications of the
DM-2 stage used for different commercial launch profiles, DM-5 is
apparently a significant block upgrade to the DM-2, getting a new
ministry article designation (17S40 instead of 11S861). Source: Novosti
Kosmonavtiki. There are now 28 working Iridium satellites in  orbit,
plus one failed one and two dummy satellites.

On Sep 12, Meteosat 7 was over 10.0W drifting 0.15 deg east per day,
in a 35753 x 35794 km x 1.8 deg geosynch drift orbit.

On Sep 14, the most recent elements available for Eutelsat's Hot Bird 3
satellite at GSFC were dated Sep 6, at which time Hot Bird 3 was still
in its initial transfer orbit and no liquid apogee motor burns had
ocurred. Hot Bird 3 is a Eurostar 2000 class satellite. The Eurostar
satellites are made by Matra Marconi Space/Toulouse [et je signale aux
lecteurs la-bas que je serai a Toulouse la mois prochaine;
recommendations  spatio-touristiques svp?]
The Eurostar satellites launched to date are:
 Inmarsat II F-1  1990 Oct 30  Eurostar 1000
 Inmarsat II F-2  1991 Mar  9  Eurostar 1000
 Inmarsat II F-3  1991 Dec 16  Eurostar 1000
 Telecom 2A       1991 Dec 16  Eurostar 2000
 Inmarsat II F-4  1992 Apr 15  Eurostar 1000
 Telecom 2B       1992 Apr 15  Eurostar 2000
 Hispasat 1A      1992 Sep 10  Eurostar 2000
 Hispasat 1B      1993 Jul 22  Eurostar 2000
 Orion 1          1994 Nov 29  Eurostar 2000
 Telecom 2C       1995 Dec  6  Eurostar 2000
 Hot Bird 2       1996 Nov 21  Eurostar 2000+
 Hot Bird 3       1997 Sep  2  Eurostar 2000+

The Hot Bird satellites provide high power TV broadcasting to supplement
Eutelsat's regular satellites, the Eutelsat 2 and forthcoming Eutelsat 3
series which are Spacebus class satellites built by Aerospatiale/Cannes.

Mars Global Surveyor entered polar orbit around Mars on Sep 12. The burn
began at 0015 UTC and ended at 0037 UTC. Orbit is  258 x 54021 km x 93.3
deg with a period of 44h59.5min. This orbit will be reduced by
aerobraking to a low, circular mapping orbit over the next few months.
MGS will be the first probe to enter a low orbit around Mars and is
the highest inclination satellite of Mars to date, beating Viking 2's
80 degree inclination.

The following is a catalog of objects in Martian orbit; the orbits are
contemporary with the active phase of the mission, and gravitational
perturbations will have greatly changed the orbits of some of the
earlier missions, possibly causing some of them to reenter. Where major
orbit maneuvers were made, starting date of later orbit is given (e.g.
Viking 2). I am confident that Mars Observer never achieved orbit
insertion, so it is not included. Corrections and updates are welcome.
Orbit heights are given relative to a reference spherical Mars of radius
3393 km.

and 12 separated from 11. The Mars-2 and Mars-3 landers separated
from the orbiters prior to orbit insertion. The following objects
failed to reach Martian orbit:
F1 M-69 No. 521          1969 Mar 27   Impact on USSR
F2 M-69 No. 522          1969 Apr  2   Destroyed during launch

F4 M-71 No. 170          1971 May 10   Failed to leave Earth orbit (Kosmos-419)
F5 M-73 No. 52S (Mars-4) 1974 Feb 10   Flew past Mars, in solar orbit
F6 1F No. 101 (Fobos-1)  1989 Jan 23   Flew past Mars, in solar orbit
F7 Mars Observer         1993 Aug 24   Flew past Mars, in solar orbit 
                                       (may have exploded 1993 Aug 21?)


The Delta stage from the ACE launch was very briefly in the L1 transfer
orbit of 175 x km x 1.5 million km x 28.7 deg, from which it would have
been perturbed into solar orbit. It then depleted its fuel with a
retrograde burn that placed it back in Earth orbit of 174 x 840904 km x
28.8 deg, from which it is expected to reenter after a few revs. (Thanks to
Boeing/Delta folks for the info).

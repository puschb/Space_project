Shuttle and Mir
---------------

Atlantis was launched on Sep 26 at 0234 UTC on mission STS-86 to Mir.
The TI rendevous terminal initiation burn was carried out at
1732 UTC on Sep 27, and Atlantis docked with the SO (Docking Module)
on the Mir complex at 1958 UTC. The crew exchange was completed on
Sep 28, with David Wolf replacing Michael Foale on the Mir crew.
The crews are currently:
 Atlantis STS-86:
  Commander, Jim Wetherbee, USN, NASA
  Pilot,     Mike Bloomfield, USAF, NASA
  Mission Specialists: 
   (MS1)  Vladimir Titov, Russian Air Force; 
   (MS2)  Dr. Scott Parazynski, NASA;
   (MS3)  Gen. Jean-Loup Chretien, CNES/France;
   (MS4)  Wendy Lawrence, USN, NASA.
   (MS5)  Dr. Michael Foale, NASA; 

 Mir EO-24:
  Commander: (KE) Aleksandr Solov'yov, Russian Air Force
  Flight Engineers: (BI-1) Pavel Vinogradov, RKK Energiya; 
                    (BI-2) Dr. David Wolf, NASA.

Titov and Parazynski are scheduled to make a spacewalk on Oct 1.
Launch of the Progress M-36 cargo ship is expected on Oct 5.

Recent Launches
---------------

A Kosmos-3M (11K65M) rocket built by AO Polyot, Omsk, was launched on
Sep 23 at 1644 UTC. The two-stage 11K65M is based on Yangel's R-14 IRBM,
and is used to launch small payloads. The restartable S3 third stage
placed the Kosmos-2346 payload in a circular 1000 km orbit. The payload
is a navigation satellite also built by AO Polyot for the Russian Navy.
The first Soviet navigation satellite was called Tsiklon and was
launched in 1967; the current satellite is of similar design and is
probably one of the Parus series.

A small secondary payload was carried on the mission: FAISAT-2V,
a data messaging satellite built and operated by Final Analysis, Inc.
of Lanham, Maryland. Vladimir Agapov reports that FAISAT separated
from the Kosmos-2346 satellite on Sep 23 at 2204 UTC.

An 8K78M Molniya-M rocket built by TsSKB-Progress of Samara, with a
Blok-ML upper stage probably built by NPO Lavochkin of Khimki, was
launched on Sep 24 and placed in elliptical orbit a Molniya-1T
communications satellite for the Russian Defense Ministry. The 
Molniya-1T satellites are built by NPO Prikladnoi Mekhaniki of the
former city Krasnoyarsk-26 (I forget its new name). The original
Molniya-1 satellite bus was developed by the Korolyov bureau and first
launched in 1964; the elliptical 12 hour orbit allowed it to spend long
times above the horizon in the Russian far north. The Molniya-1T
replaced the older Molniya-1 model at some point in the 1970s, but the
details of which satellites were Molniya-1 and which were Molniya-1T
have not yet been released by the Russians.

Five more Iridium satellites were launched on Sep 27. The new group
includes the SV019 satellite which was left out of an earlier launch.
The two stage Boeing Delta 7920-10C was launched from Space Launch
Complex 2 at Vandenberg AFB and deployed the satellites
in a 540 x 564 km x 86.7 deg parking orbit. The second stage then
restarted to enter a disposal orbit of 488 x 607 km x 86.9 deg.

Boeing is planning some new variants of the Delta II to launch NASA's
Med-Lite class payloads. The standard Delta 7920 has nine Alliant GEM
solid strapons, an extra-extended long tank Thor first stage, and a
Delta/AJ10-118K second stage. The Delta 7925 version adds a Star 48
(PAM-D) solid motor third stage. The new variants are the Delta 7320 and
7420, which are like the Delta 7920 but with only 3 or 4 solid strapons,
and the Delta 7326 and 7426, which add a Star 37FM solid third stage.
The small Star 37C,D and E motors were used as Delta third stages from
the late 1960s to early 1980s, when they were phased out in favour of
the much more powerful Star 48. The Star 37FM is an improved version of
the older Star 37 models.
  Stage      Impulse     Mass

  Star 37E   2910 kNs    1123 kg
  Star 37FM  3053 kNs    1148 kg
  Star 48    5700 kNs    2140 kg


The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) launched the IRS-1D remote
sensing satellite on Sep 29 from Sriharikota range. IRS-1D was placed in
a 306 x 822 km x 98.6 deg orbit by the 4-stage PSLV (Polar Satellite
Launch Vehicle). The intended orbit for IRS satellites is around 800 km
circular, possibly indicating a launch vehicle problem since earlier IRS
satellites did not have their own orbit-changing propulsion system.
We'll have to wait and see if it maneuvers to raise perigee. The 1200 kg
satellite is similar to IRS-1C and carries the 23-m resolution CCD-based
LISS sensor, a 6-m resolution black and white imager, and a low res wide
field sensor with an 800 km image width.

The CZ-3B launch of Aug 19, which placed Agila 2 in orbit, was apparently
not as successful as first thought. The initial transfer orbit was
170 x 44499 km x 24.63 deg, which is  higher apogee than the standard
GTO orbit. However, reportedly the intended apogee was several thousand
km higher still, and extra fuel had to be used to let the satellite
reach its final orbit.


Not So Recent Launches
----------------------

40 years ago, on 1957 Oct 4, the 8K71PS launch vehicle, a minor
modification of the experimental 8K71 ICBM, was launched from the NIIP-5
test range in Kazakstan (then the Kazakh SSR). Despite premature
shutdown of the Blok A core stage, the core stage and its satellite
payload, PS-1, reached orbit to become the first artificial earth
satellites. The PS-1 and the 8K71 (R-7) were developed by Sergei
Korolyov's design bureau at NII-88/Podlipki, now RKK Energiya.
 Here at the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory we will be
celebrating the 40th anniversary of the optical satellite tracking
project which led to improved understanding of geodesy and atmospheric
density; our former director Fred Whipple will be giving his
reminiscences. We extend our best wishes to all veterans of the
Baker-Nunn, Moonwatch, and related programs around the world.

Shuttle and Mir
---------------

Solov'yov and Vinogradov carried out another EVA on Nov 6, with hatch
open at 0012 UTC and close at 0629 UTC. The Kvant-2 interior compartment
was used as the airlock. The Russian MSB-SO solar array, which has been
stored on the outside of the SO module since its delivery to the station
by Atlantis on mission STS-74, has now been installed on the Kvant
module replacing the elderly MSB-4. (The new array is not, as I claimed
last week, the MCSA US/Russian array, which is already deployed on the
opposite side of Kvant. Thanks to Gabe Katell for pointing out this
goof). The Kvant-2 airlock hatch was thought to be sealed after the Nov
6 EVA, but it turns out that the ShSO (Airlock special compartment) of
Kvant 2 is still leaking. The PNO (Instrument-science compartment),
which is the next room in, can continue to be used as the airlock until
the outer lock is fixed. Jim Oberg points out that it's not clear how
long the depressurized activity on Nov 3 lasted. The ShSO was no longer
at vacuum as early as 0940 UTC, but at 0953 UTC and possibly as late as
around 1045 UTC (guessing from the fact that Chris van den Berg 
monitored radio from them in the inner airlock at 1109) the crew were
still operating at a pressure under 5 psi. and they were not able to
remove their suits until after 1100 UTC. So it depends on what pressure
level you consider to count as vacuum conditions. 

The Shuttle Carrier Aircraft carrying Atlantis has left Kennedy en route
to the Boeing North American plant at Palmdale, California for Atlantis'
Orbiter Maintenance Down Period (OMDP) refit. OV-104 will not be making
any flights until 1999.



Recent Launches
---------------

The final Block IIA Navstar Global Positioning Satellite, SVN 38, was
orbited on Nov 5. The Block IIA GPS satellites were built by
Boeing/Seal Beach (former Rockwell), and launched on Boeing/Huntingdon
Beach (former McDonnell Douglas) Delta 7925 rockets. GPS SVN 38
fired its Thiokol Star 37 apogee motor on Nov 8 and is now in
a 19914 x 20626 km x 54.9 deg orbit. The PAM-D third stage remains
in the 187 x 20391 km x 35.0 deg transfer orbit, while in its
final depletion burn the Delta second stage orbit was raised
to 459 x 561 km x 35.2 deg.

The Ariane 502 launch anomaly seems to be really minor. Apparently
when the solid boosters separated there was a bit more roll torque
on the core stage than expected, and the centrifugal force pushed
the propellant away from the fuel gauge, fooling it into thinking
that the rocket was out of fuel a little early. Sounds like an easy
fix for the next mission, and the sort of thing that would be hard
to catch prior to an actual test flight.

The Lockheed Martin/USAF Titan 4A-17 was launched on Nov 8 into highly
elliptical orbit, carrying a classified signals intelligence satellite
for the NRO (National Reconnaissance Office), probably in conjuction
with the NSA (National Security Agency). It is believed that the
satellite is a TRUMPET, with a large deployable mesh antenna, designed
to monitor Soviet communications and missile tests (yes, *I* know the
Soviets no longer exist... but I'm sure NRO can find something useful to
listen into). One rumour was that the prime contractor for TRUMPET is
Boeing/Seattle, but that's not well established. Two earlier TRUMPET
satellites were launched in May 1994 and Jun 1995. The new satellite 
and Centaur TC-16 were launched into a 185 x 185 km x 55.0 deg parking
orbit. The Centaur restarted  to enter a 204 x 27890 km x 55.0 deg
transfer orbit, and made a third burn to an 1100 x 39059 km x 63.6 deg
operational orbit. This 'Molniya type' 12-hour, low precession, orbit 
is also used by the SDS communications satellites which relay data from
NRO imaging recon satellites. After spacecraft separation the Centaur
vented its remaining propellants, and as on previous TRUMPET missions
this caused some comet discovery reports to come in to the IAU Central
Bureau for Astronomical Telegrams.

Meanwhile, the NRO's LACROSSE 3 classified radar imaging payload is now
in a 664 x 666 km x 55.0 deg operational orbit, according to amateur
observers. Its Lockheed/Sunnyvale Bus-1 propulsion system raised the
perigee from an initial 430 x 669 km orbit.

Five more Motorola Iridium satellites were launched by Boeing Delta 2 on
Nov 9 into a 625 x 642 km x 86.6 deg orbit. The Delta second stage then
lowered its perigee to 253 km.  Of the Iridium satellites launched
previously, all but three  are in a 777 x 777 km x 86.4  deg operational
orbit. Iridium SV011 is 15 km lower; Iridium SV021 and SV027 never left
their initial parking orbits.

Mars Global Surveyor resumed aerobraking on Nov 9. Orbit is now 135 x
45088 km  x 93 deg. It will continue aerobraking for a few months
and then pause again, before finally reaching its target sun-synchronous
orbit in 1999, a year later than planned thanks to the problem with its
solar panel.

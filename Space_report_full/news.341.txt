Shuttle and Mir
---------------

Columbia is awaiting a Nov 19 launch on the STS-87 science mission.
Cargo bay payloads are: (Bay locations are approximate only;
I will try and correct them later)
 NaSBE       GABA, Bay 2 Stbd
 EDFT-OTD    APC?, Bay 3 Port
 G-036       GABA, Bay 4 Port
 EDFT-ORU    GABA?, Bay 4 Stbd
 Spartan     MPESS, Bay 5
 TGDF        GABA, Bay 6 Port
 LHP         GABA, Bay 6 Stbd
 SOLSE       GABA, Bay 7 Stbd
 USMP-4 Fwd  MPESS, Bay 8? 
 USMP-4 Aft  MPESS, Bay 9?
 OARE        Bay 11 keel
 EDO         Bay 13

The MPESS is a large cross-bay device to carry the big
experiments. The GABA and APC are small carriers attached
to the payload bay side wall. 

The main payloads for STS-87 are Spartan 201 and USMP-4. Spartan 201 is
a small free flying solar observatory that sits on top of an MPESS
carrier. It will be deployed and recovered with the robot arm; this is
its fourth flight. USMP-4 is a US Microgravity Payload, with experiments
to process materials in free fall. It uses two MPESS carries on
which a variety of furnaces and processing equipment are installed.

The EDFT payloads are equipment for Space Station spacewalk practice;
the OTD is an experimental crane and the ORU is a dummy Orbital
Replacement Unit. 

The EDO in the rear of the bay is the Extended Duration Orbiter kit,
which provides extra power for long duration missions.

The G-036, NaSBE, TGDF, LHP and SOLSE experiments are small experiments
using GAS (Getaway Special) canisters. LHP is the Loop Heat Pipe, and
NaSBE is the Sodium Sulfur Battery Experiment. SOLSE and LORE are ozone
measuring devices. G-036 is a student experiment from El Paso Community
College to mix cement in space; it was originally going to fly on
STS-86. TGDF is Turbulent Gas Diffusion Flames, 
a basic physics experiment.

OARE flies on all Columbia missions, and measures accelerations
during flight.

During the spacewalk, a small satellite which is brought up inside the
Shuttle cabin will be taken out and released. AERCam Sprint is a remote
controlled free-flying TV camera attached to gas thrusters, in a padded 
sphere. It's a prototype to test out the ability to inspect the Space
Station exterior without actually sending astronauts outside.

Crew of STS-87 consists of commander Kevin Kregel, pilot Steven Lindsey,
mission specialists Winston Scott, Kalpana Chawla (a native of India), 
Takao Doi (from the Japanese NASDA space agency),  and payload
specialist Leonid Kadenyuk from the Ukrainian space agency.

Atlantis has arrived in Palmdale for its Orbiter Maintenance
Down Period. New cockpit displays will be installed,
and the airlock will be relocated to the payload bay docking
system area. 

The outer Kvant-2 EVA hatch on Mir is still leaking. A new outer hatch
seal will be delivered by the next Progress cargo ship. Meanwhile, the
inner airlock compartment is safely sealed and will continue to be used
for external spacewalks.

Recent Launches
---------------

A Krunichev Proton was launched from Baykonur on Nov 12 with an Energiya
Blok DM-2 upper stage and a geostationary payload, the first Kupon
comsat for the Russian banking system. Kupon is the first commercial
comsat made by the Lavochkin group, who usually make planetary probes
and early warning satellites; previous Russian comsats were made by NPO
Prikladnoi Mekhaniki. Kupon, owned by the Russian Federation Central
Bank (and possibly Global Information Systems of Moscow), relays
financial data for the Bankir network.

Ariane V102 successfully launched two communications satellites on Nov
12 at 2148 UTC. The Ariane 44L type rocket has four strapon PAL liquid
boosters made by Daimler-Benz Aerospace. The Aerospatiale L220 first
stage separates after 3 minutes; the Daimler-Benz L33 second stage then
fires for 2 more minutes, followed by the long 13 minute burn of
Aerospatiale's H-10-3 high energy liquid-hydrogen third stage, which
entered orbit at 2208 UTC along with the payload. Unlike Delta, Atlas
and Proton, the Ariane 4 flies directly to elliptical geostationary
transfer orbit without first entering a low parking orbit. The
Sirius 2 satellite was ejected at 2210 UTC, then at 2212 the top of the
SPELDA structure which encapsulates the lower payload. At 2214 the
Carkawarta-1 satellite was ejected from the lower part of SPELDA which
remains attached to the H-10-3.

V102's first payload was Sirius 2, a Spacebus 3000 Ku-band
communications and broadcast satellite for Sweden's NSAB (Nordiska
Satellit aktiebolaget), built by Aerospatiale/Cannes. NSAB's first
satellite was TELE-X, a Spacebus 300 launched in 1989. It was later
supplemented by  Sirius 1, a much smaller satellite already in orbit.
Sirius 1 was originally British Satellite Broadcasting's Marcopolo 1,
and was bought in orbit by NSAB in Dec 1993.

The second payload was Cakrawarta 1, formerly known as Indostar. This is
the first of a new type of small comsat, the StarBus, developed by CTA
Inc. of Rockville, Maryland, which has since been bought by Orbital
Sciences. Although press reports have described StarBus as a lightsat,
the launch and dry masses of Indostar are 1385 kg and 643 kg, very
similar to the venerable (but still in production) Hughes HS-376 class.
The satellite is owned by PT MediaCitra Indostar, which will use it for
television broadcasting in Indonesia. The satellite features an Primex
Aerospace liquid propulsion system (maybe! I've seen different
stories on this - can anyone confirm?) and, unusually, an S-band antenna -
most television broadcast satellites use 11GHz Ku-band, but apparently
the 2.5 GHz S-band frequencies give better transmission through the
rainy Indonesian skies.

Errata: Lacrosse 3 is in a 57.3 degree orbit; the second TRUMPET was
launched in Jul 1995.

Shuttle and Mir

OV-102 Columbia was launched on Nov 19 on the STS-87 science mission.
Solid rocket motors RSRM-63 separated two minutes after launch. The
orbiter rolled to a heads up position five minutes after launch, in a
test of communications via the TDRS comsat. Main engine cutoff and
separation of External Tank ET-89 came at T+8 minutes, leaving OV-102 in
an elliptical transfer orbit. It then entered a 300 km circular orbit at
28 deg inclination.

Cargo bay payloads are:

 OARE        Bay 11 keel           Accelerations
 EDO         Bay 12-13             Extended duration kit

Spartan 201 was released a day late (because of a safemode event on the
SOHO satellite whose results it will calibrate), at 2105 UTC on Nov 21.
However the satellite did not start its automatic orientation maneuver
because the crew failed to send it the correct commands prior to release.
Mission specialist Chalwa moved the robot arm in to grapple it again
at about 2110 UTC. The grapple was unsuccessful and the Spartan was left
tumbling. At 2210 it was decided to move away from Spartan for the day.

Spartan was recaptured at around 0200 UTC on Nov 25. The capture was
made by hand, during a spacewalk by Takao Doi and Winston Scott. The
astronauts had difficulty berthing it so Chalwa grappled it with the RMS
arm and berthed it around 0330 UTC. The spacewalk started at 0002 UTC
Nov 25 and ended 0945 UTC; the tests of space station tools went well,
but the free-flying Sprint camera subsatellite was not deployed due to
lack of time.

Recent Launches
---------------

A Resurs-F1M satellite, built by the Progress Central Specialized
Design Bureau, was launched on Nov 18 by a Soyuz-U rocket (also
built by Progress). It is based on the Vostok/Zenit type bus used
since 1960 for spy satellites, civil recoverable satellites, and
the Vostok and Voskhod spaceships. On Nov 26 Resurs-F1M was in
a 208 x 243 km x 82.3 deg orbit.

Thanks to all the folks at Primex (formerly Olin and Rocket Research)
who sent me information on Cakrawarta 1. This is the first geostationary
satellite to use a Primex propulsion system for attitude control (with
twelve MR-103G thrusters) and stationkeeping (with four MR-501
electrothermal hydrazine thrusters); a Thiokol Star 30E solid motor was
used for the apogee burn. (Primex provided small propulsion systems
for many other spacecraft, including the Voyager probes.)

Last week I reported a rumour that the classified TRUMPET sigint
satellite (whose codename was leaked to the Baltimore Sun a couple years
ago) was built by Boeing/Seattle; however, for the record, Aviation Week
claims that Hughes/El Segundo is the prime contractor. 

Maxim Tarasenko reports that Global Info Systems, the owner of Kupon, is
in fact a subsidiary of the Russian central bank. The Kupon,
Sirius 2 and Cakrawarta satellites are currently drifting toward their
stations in the geostationary ring.

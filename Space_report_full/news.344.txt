Shuttle and Mir
---------------

The last Shuttle mission of the year, STS-87, has been completed.
Columbia landed on Dec 5, with a deorbit burn at 1121 UTC, returning to
Earth the Spartan satellite and the USMP-4 microgravity science payload.
Touchdown was at 1220 UTC on KSC's runway 33. Launch of STS-89 has been
delayed a few days to Jan 22; Endeavour was rolled out to pad 39A on Dec
19. STS-89 will dock with the Mir station.

Progress M-36 undocked from Mir on Dec 17 at 0602 UTC and flew out to a
range of 700m. The Inspector satellite was deployed at 0735 to take
pictures of Mir, but its navigation system failed and it drifted away
from the station. X-Mir Inspector was built by Daimler-Benz
Aerospace/Bremen, Germany. Progress M-36 was deorbited at 1620 UTC on
Dec 19. Progress M-37 was launched from Baykonur the following day, and
will bring new supplies to the Mir station.

Erratum
-------

The Cyclade adapter system, Stefan Barensky tells me, was also used on the
first Ariane 4 launch in 1988.


Recent Launches
---------------

Two Iridium satellites were launched on Dec 8 from Taiyuan in China.
Iridium 42 and 44 were launched by a Chang Zheng 2C-3-SD rocket with a
'Smart Dispenser' upper stage. This rocket was test flown with two dummy
satellites earlier in the year. Five more Iridium satellites, built by
Motorola and Lockheed, were launched on a Boeing Delta 2 from Vandenberg
on Dec 20; I don't have their serial numbers yet.

The Galaxy 8I comsat was launched from Cape Canaveral by Lockheed
Martin's AC-149 Atlas 2AS. The Centaur stage entered a supersynchronous
transfer orbit of 280 x 50607 km with inclination of 26.8 deg.
Galaxy 8I is a Hughes HS-601HP satellite owned by Panamsat and
will be used by Galaxy Latin America broadcasting.

Kosmos-2347 was launched on Dec 9 by Tsiklon-2 from 5-GIK Baykonur. 
(SPACEWARN initially called this satellite Kosmos-2348 in error). The
satellite, developed by KB Arsenal, is a US-P class naval electronic
intelligence satellite and was launched into a 110 x 400 km transfer
orbit by the two-stage 11K69 Tsiklon-2 (built by the Ukranian Yuzhnoe
enterprise with Russian engines). Its own engine then fired to
circularize at 401 x 419 km x 65.0 deg.

Kosmos-2348 was launched Dec 15 by Soyuz-U from Plesetsk. It is a
Yantar'-class reconnaissance satellite (probably a Kobalt class vehicle)
in a 165 x 343 km x 67.1 deg orbit. The Kobalt satellites are believed
to be similar to the earlier Oktan (Yantar'-4K1) satellites, which
carried a Zhemchug camera system in a large recoverable OSA (Special
Apparatus Module) reentry vehicle, attached during the mission to a
service module with solar panels and a maneuvring engine. The Oktan
satellites also carried two small SpK film return capsules which were
recovered while the mission was still in progress. The Yantar' series
are built by the TsSKB-Progress enterprise in Samara, Russia.


JCSAT-5 is now in geosynchronous orbit. Jun Takei from JCSAT reports
that the five liquid apogee motor burns were carried out from Dec 4 to
Dec 8, and the solar panels and antenna have been deployed.

Av Week now has changed its mind and says that the TRUMPET satellite was
a Boeing/Kent Valley product, in agreement with my sources.

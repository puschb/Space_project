Shuttle and Mir
---------------

Progress M-37 (7K-TGM No. 236) was launched from Baykonur on Dec 20, and
brought new supplies to the Mir station. It docked at 1022 UTC
on Dec 22.

Recent Launches
---------------

Intelsat 804 was launched on Dec 22 by an Ariane 42L
rocket. The satellite, built for the International Telecommunications
Satellite Organization by Lockheed Martin Telecommunications, will
be placed in geostationary orbit by its liquid apogee engine.

Eight small 40 kg Orbcomm communications satellites were placed in low orbit
on Dec 23 by a Pegasus XL rocket with a HAPS hydrazine fourth stage.
The L-1011 carrier aircraft took off from Wallops Island and
released the rocket over the Atlantic. Orbcomm is a subsidiary of
Orbital Sciences, who also make the Pegasus rocket.

Early Bird, Earth Watch Inc's 3-m commercial remote sensing satellite,
was launched on Dec 24 by an STT Kompleks Start-1 launch vehicle from the
Russian Svobodniy (2-GIK) launch site.

A Krunichev Proton-K launch from Baykonur on Dec 24 placed an Energiya
Blok DM3 upper stage in low perigee orbit with the Asiasat 3 payload
attached. An hour later the Blok DM3 ignited to enter a geosynchronous
transfer orbit, but 6 hr 20min after launch the second burn of the Blok
DM3 shut down after only one second, stranding Asiasat in elliptical
transfer orbit. Asiasat 3 was a Hughes HS-601 comsat for Hong Kong based
Asia Telecommunications.

The launch of Iridium 42 and 44 by a Chinese CZ-2C rocket on Dec 8
left the second stage and several pieces of debris in low transfer orbit.
However, another object, 1997-77H/25084, was cataloged in an orbit
similar in height to the Iridium payloads, but more elliptical. 
This object must be associated with the SD (Smart Dispenser) upper
stage; the SD itself is meant to deorbit after releasing the Iridiums,
to minimize space debris, but perhaps this last burn of the SD did
not go right and it ended up still in orbit. Alternatively, 77H may
be some kind of adapter that got released.

Shuttle and Mir
---------------

Despite problems with his Sokol emergency spacesuit, Andy Thomas
replaced David Wolf as a Mir crew member on Jan 25. Endeavour undocked
from Mir on Jan 29 at 1657 UTC and made one flyaround of the
station before its sep burn. Endeavour landed on Jan 31 at Kennedy
Space Center's runway 15 at 2235 UTC.

Shortly before Endeavour's undocking, Soyuz TM-27 was launched carrying
the new Mir crew. Commander is Talgat Musabaev from Kazakstan, and
flight engineer is Russian Nikolai Budarin. French astronaut Leopold
Eyharts is Soyuz TM-27 cosmonaut-researcher, and will stay aboard Mir
until returning with the Soyuz TM-26 crew of Anatoliy Solov'yov and
Pavel Vinogradov in February. After Soyuz TM-27 reached orbit and
Endeavour undocked, there were 13 humans in space on three separate
spacecraft, equalling the previous record.

Progress M-37 undocked from the Kvant module at 1253 UTC on Jan 30.
Soyuz TM-27 then docked at this port (+X) at 1754 UTC Jan 31.
After the departure of Soyuz TM-26 from the -X port on Mir, TM-27
will fly around to the -X port and Progress M-37 may attempt
to dock again at +X in a further test of the remote control TORU
system.

The next Shuttle mission is STS-90/Neurolab, using orbiter Columbia.

Recent Launches
---------------

A classified satellite for the National Reconnaissance Office was put
into elliptical 63 degree inclination orbit on Jan 29 by a Lockheed
Martin Atlas IIA Centaur rocket. This rocket, AC-109, was launched way
out of production sequence and it seems likely  launch of the payload is
several years late. Rumour has it that the satellite's name is
CAPRICORN. It may be a follow-on to the SDS communications data relay
satellites used to pass on spy satellite imaging data, and may also have
either infrared missile warning or signals intelligence secondary
payloads aboard. Another theory is that it may be the COBRA BRASS
payload for infrared early warning satellite technology development,
which was announced as due to fly this year.

Arianespace's first launch of the year was an Ariane 44LP model, 
placing two satellites in geostationary transfer orbit. The upper
payload was Brasilsat B-3, a communications satellite for Brazil's
EMBRATEL. The satellite is the third Hughes HS-376W, a spin-stabilized
satellite which is actually much larger than the old standard HS-376 and
which uses a liquid apogee engine instead of a solid motor. The lower
satellite was Inmarsat 3 F5, for the International Maritime
Communications Satellite Organization (based in London). Inmarsat 3 F5
is an LM Series 4000 satellite with a solid Thiokol Star 30 apogee
motor, built by Lockheed Martin/East Windsor.

Orbital Sciences Corp.'s second Taurus rocket reached orbit on
Feb 10, making two successes on two attempts for Taurus. The first
Taurus flight was a hybrid using a refurbished Peacekeeper stage 1
as its first stage; this one is believed to be the first `true' 
Taurus, using a Castor 120 first stage. Castor 120 is Thiokol's civilian
version of the Peacekeeper stage. This Taurus also uses a new, larger,
payload fairing for its multiple satellite payload.

The primary payload on Taurus was the Geosat Follow-On (GFO), built by
Ball Aerospace for the US Navy Space and Naval Systems Warfare Command
using a modified Techstar bus with a mass of 365 kg. The original Geosat
was a larger research satellite launched in 1985 on an Atlas, and
provided sea surface height information (and thus information on the
shape of the Earth's gravity field) with a radio altimeter. Geosat it
turn was a successor to NASA's 1978 Seasat mission. GFO is a smaller
satellite which will be the first to directly provide tactical altimeter
information, downlinking to USN ships allowing them to avoid strong
head-on currents; GFO data may also have a role in anti-submarine
warfare. GFO carries a 13.5 GHz pulse radar altimeter, a radiometer for
spotting underwater currents and ice packs, GPS receiver for determining
its orbit, and hydrazine thrusters for fine orbit adjust. GFO's final
planned orbit is expected to be  800 x 800 km x 108 deg; its initial
orbit is 777 x 875 km x 108.0 deg.

Two Orbcomm low orbit comsats were also carried on the flight, stacked
beneath GFO. They join the eight satellites orbited on a  Pegasus in
December. The final stage of the Taurus carries the second CPAC
(Celestis Payload Attach Container) with the cremated remains of several
individuals.


Erratum for JSR 347: Tony Stroeve informs me that although the Lockheed
Martin LM700 bus is derived from the Lockheed Martin/Motorola Iridium
bus, the Iridium is not considered an LM700.

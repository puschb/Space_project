Shuttle and Mir
---------------

Anatoliy Solov'yov and Pavel Vinogradov of the Mir EO-24 crew
and Leopold Eyharts of the CNES Pegase mission undocked from the -X
port on Mir at 0552 UTC on Feb 19 aboard the Soyuz TM-26 ship.
Soyuz TM-26 fired its deorbit engines at 0816 UTC and the craft
landed in Kazakstan at 50 11N, 67 31E at 0910 UTC.

Solov'yov handed over command of Mir to the EO-25 commander, Talgat
Musabaev on Feb 18 or Feb 19 (can anyone tell me when the official   
transfer occurred?) On Feb 20, the Mir EO-25 crew, Talgat Musabaev and
Nikolai Budarin, together with Andy Thomas of the NASA-7 mission,
boarded their Soyuz TM-27 transport and undocked from the Kvant +X port
at 0848 UTC. They redocked with the -X port on Mir at 0932 UTC. This
frees up the Kvant port for a test redocking of the Progress M-37 cargo
ship, currently parked in orbit.

Recent Launches
---------------


Boeing/Huntingdon Beach (former McDonnell Douglas) carried out two Delta
launches within a week in mid-Feb, placing a total of 9 payloads in
orbit. The first four Globalstar satellites, built by Space
Systems/Loral, were launched on Feb 14. The Boeing Delta 7420 placed
them in  a 1400 km orbit. Most sources are    naming them Globalstar U1,
U2, L1 and L2; as far as I can tell these just denote that on this
particular launch they were the upper and lower pairs on the Delta
dispenser, so there will be a U1,U2,L1,L2 on every Delta Globalstar
launch and they don't really reflect unique names for  the satellites.
If anyone has the actual production or post-launch names for these
satellites, please let me know. 

The Globalstar launch was the first Delta 7420-10 variant, one of a
number of new cheaper Delta variants. The first digit in the Delta
indicates the first stage variety; 7 means the Delta II first stage with
Alliant GEM solid motors. The second digit indicates the number of solid
motors; the third digit gives the type of second stage; and the fourth
digit gives the type of third stage ( 0 means no third stage ). The
fairing designation is then given after a hyphen; -10 means the 10-foot
(3.1m) diameter fairing. Versions in use in 1998-99 are:

  Delta 7320     Delta II Lite with 3 strapons
  Delta 7326     Delta II Lite with 3 strapons and Star 37FM third stage
  Delta 7420     Delta II Lite with 4 strapons
  Delta 7425     Delta II Lite with 4 strapons and PAM-D (Star 48) stage
  Delta 7426     Delta II Lite with 4 strapons and Star 37FM
  Delta 7920     Delta II standard, LEO missions
  Delta 7925     Delta II with PAM-D third stage for GEO and escape missions
  -              Delta III with GEM LDXL strapons and LH2/LOX second stage

Boeing hasn't announced a corresponding designation for the Delta III
yet. For consistency with the existing 28-year-old tradition, I suggest
it should be  the Delta 8930, with the 8 indicating the change to the
LDXL strapons, 9 indicating the number of strapons, and 3 indicating a
new type of second stage. They'll need some designation like this as
soon as someone orders a slightly different kind of Delta 3, say one
with fewer strapons, and they could then denote the planned Delta 4
variants as 9020/9025, 9030, and 9240 in the same system. However, since
consistency of nomenclature has never been the space program's strong
point, I expect they'll ignore my suggestion and introduce an entirely
different scheme.


Five more Motorola/Lockheed Iridium satellites were launched on Feb 18
by a Boeing Delta 7920-10C from Vandenberg. The five satellites will
use their own on-board propulsion systems to reach their final orbits.

The two recently launched Orbcomm satellites are Orbcomm G1 and G2,  
production numbers FM3 and FM4. With Iridium, Globalstar and Orbcomm
launches now underway, the expected shift of commercial emphasis from
geostationary to low orbit constellations is now a fact.

Kosmos-2349, launched on Feb 17, is an imaging satellite for the Russian
Defense Ministry. On Feb 19, Kosmos-2349 was in a 212 x 276 km x 70.4
deg orbit. The satellite is built by TsSKB-Progress of Samara and is 
based on the Yantar' bus. It is probably a Kometa mapping satellite,  
using the 11F660 Yantar'-1KFT spacecraft. The last Kometa launch in May 1996
was a failure.


Japan's largest launch vehicle, the H-II, suffered its first failure
this week during launch of the Kakehashi satellite. The Japanese
applications space agency NASDA carried out the launch of  H-II No. 5F
on 1998 Feb 21. This was actually the 6th H-II launch, as H-II No. 6F
was launched last November with the TRMM and ETS-7 satellites. The
payload for the new flight was COMETS, or Communuications and
Broadcasting Experimental Test Satellite. COMETS, based on the ETS-6
bus, carries an experimental Ka-band communications payload and a
payload for inter-satellite data relay. The H-II was meant to deliver
COMETS and its attached LAPS transfer engine into geostationary transfer
orbit with 35000 km apogee, but orbital     tracking data indicate a
much lower 250 x 1883 km x 30.0 deg orbit. This was reportedly due to 
premature shutdown 44s into the H-II second stage's second burn. 
COMETS, renamed Kakehashi now it is in orbit, has successfully  deployed
its solar arrays and checked out its on-board systems. It may still be
possible to use the LAPS-derived UPS (Unified Propulsion System) apogee
engine to raise COMETS to some kind of useful orbit. This engine itself
failed the last time it was  used, on the ETS-6 flight in 1994.
Meanwhile, troubles with control of   the ETS-7 satellite continue, and
it is not clear when the rendezvous/docking experiments will take place.
NASDA have run into a lot of trouble recently, also suffering the
failure of ADEOS and problems in their engine development program.
However, their previous  record of success, and the fact that all 6 H-II
flights have at least reached orbit, suggests they have the expertise to
eventually overcome their current difficulties.

I now understand that the informal name change of the USAF operated pads
at Cape Canaveral from LC (Launch Complex) to SLC (Space Launch Complex)
was made official at some point during 1997, so I am adopting the change
in my launch listings. I'm guessing, however, that NASA KSC  retains the
honorable name of LC39 for their Shuttle pads. Vandenberg introduced
the SLC abbreviation for their orbital pads in July 1966.

Erratum:  Apogee motor for Inmarsat is Star 37FM, not Star 30.

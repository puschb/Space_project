Shuttle and Mir
---------------

Progress M-37 redocked with the Kvant module on the Mir complex
on Feb 23. Musabaev took official command of Mir in the early
hours (UTC) of Feb 19.

Launch of STS-90 is now due for Apr 16.

Recent Launches
---------------

The final fuel dump from the Japanese H-II second stage
was observed from Argentina as a mag -2 cometary object
at 0850 UTC on Feb 21. The name of the COMETS satellite, 
"Kakehashi" reportedly means "bridge" or "intermediary" (thanks
to Geoff Perry for forwarding tht info). Kakehashi's apogee motor
will be fired to place it in a higher orbit.

Orbital's L-1011 Stargazer launch plane took off from Vandenberg at 0605
UTC on Feb 26 and launched a Pegasus XL over the Pacific an hour later
over 36.0N 123.0W. The three stage Pegasus placed two satellites in a
535 x 580 km x 97.8 deg orbit.

The main payload for the Pegasus launch was SNOE, the Student Nitric
Oxide Explorer. This small satellite built by the University of Colorado
measures the NO density as a function of altitude. It's the first
satellite in the small STEDI (Student Explorer Demonstration Initiative)
program, or University Explorer (UNEX) series. (Technically, HETE was
also managed under the UNEX umbrella).

The secondary payload is T1, Bill Gates' first satellite.  This
demonstration payload is an Orbital-built Microstar bus (used for the
Orbcomm satellites), but with an experimental Boeing/Seattle Ka-band high
frequency, broadband, high throughput data communications payload.  It's
a pathfinder for the Teledesic LEO constellation which will build a
global space-based Internet.

The T1 satellite was cloaked in secrecy prior to launch, hidden behind a
cover story called BATSAT.  BATSAT was advertised as a small technology
satellite from the Texas Space Grant Consortium, intended to transmit
Ka-band and X-band signals to test out signal attenuation with the Jet
Propulsion Lab's Deep Space Network. It now seems possible that this
story was largely a fiction. 

Hot Bird 4 was launched on Feb 27. Hot Bird 4 is a high power television
satellite for EUTELSAT, the European Telecommunications Satellite Organization.
It was launched by Arianespace's Ariane 42P launch vehicle, with two
solid strapon motors. The Eurostar class satellite was built by
Matra Marconi Space/Toulouse.

On Feb 28, a Lockheed Martin/Denver Atlas IIAS rocket, AC-151, was
launched with the Intelsat 806 international telecommunications
satellite. The LM7000 class satellite, built by Lockheed Martin/East
Windsor, will provide communications to Europe and Latin America.
Transfer orbit for Intelsat 806 was 190 x 35656 km x 23.0 deg.

The Iridium folks have provided me with the correct names for the
Feb 18 Iridium launch. Upcoming launches include Iridium 51 and 61
on Long March, and 55, 57, 58, 59, 60 on Delta; Globalstar inform me
the prelaunch name for their payloads are simply FM1 to FM4, but
names based on the satellites' position in the constellation will
be assigned later. The initial Globalstar orbital heights were 1250
km; their on-board propulsion will raise the orbits later.

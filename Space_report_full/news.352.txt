Shuttle and Mir
---------------

Talgat Musabaev and Nikolai Budarin entered the Kvant-2 module on Mar 3
and depressurized the inner (PNO) and outer (ShSO) airlock in 
preparation for a spacewalk. However, they were unable to open the outer
hatch, which was repaired by the previous crew. The airlock compartment
was eventually repressurized; duration in vacuum is not yet available.
Depress was probably earlier than 0130 UTC; repress was around 0245 UTC.

AXAF
----

NASA has named Eileen Collins to command Shuttle mission STS-93 which
will deploy the AXAF observatory. STS-93 will be the first space mission
to be commanded by a woman (not counting Vostok-6, the solo flight by
Tereshkova). Eileen Collins, who has made two flights as pilot, will be
STS-93 commander. This may not seem like a big deal to some of my
readers from around the world, but in a country where the first woman
president still seems quite a way off I think it's a significant thing
for kids to see a woman in a prominent command role. The USSR at one
point had plans for Svetlana Savitskaya to command a Soyuz mission, but
the flight was cancelled; that crew would have been all-female, one
suspects because the old guys in charge of the Soyuz program at that
time couldn't cope with the idea of a woman giving male cosmonauts
orders. Fortunately, NASA has gotten its act together a little better
than that for some years now, with the women mission specialists being
selected for missions on an equal basis. Kathy Sullivan was named
Payload Commander (in charge of the payload component of a mission) of
the 1992 flight of STS-45 and almost half of the Payload Commander slots
have been filled by women. The mission Commander slot, however, is a
role with much greater prestige and real authority. Collins was picked
as the first female pilot astronaut in 1990, making her the first to be
eligible for this command slot, and her selection for this mission is
consistent  with the careers of the rest of her astronaut class.

Steve Hawley, the former astronomer who deployed Hubble, is also on the
crew, together with pilot Jeff Ashby and mission specialists Cady
Coleman and Michel Tognini.


Launch of STS-93 is now scheduled for Dec 3.  Work on preparing
the payload for launch continues, with a recent successful end-to-end
test flowing data through the spacecraft and flight instruments
to the control center. I've started an STS-93 web page at

Recent Launches
---------------

No launches yet this month.

Lunar Prospector continues in a 100 km lunar polar orbit. On Mar 5
NASA announced that LP has confirmed the presence of ice in the
lunar soil in the polar regions, greatly increasing the possibilities
for lunar colonization.


The five Iridium satellites launched on Feb 18 began raising their orbits
to operational altitude in early March.
Most of the Iridium constellation is in a 100.4 min, 774 x 780 km x 86.4
deg operational orbit to which the satellites maneuver after launch into
a much lower parking orbit. However, some satellites have been placed in  
a reserve orbit 10-15 km lower than the operational one. One satellite was
temporarily placed in a higher 785 x 790 km orbit. Of the 51 Iridium  
satellites launched to date, two failed and remained in parking orbit;
six are currently in the reserve orbit; four were still raising their orbits
from parking to operational as of March 9; and the remaining 39 satellites
are in the operational orbit. Details of orbital changes for individual
satellites are as follows:

1997 Jul:    SV021 failed, stayed in parking orbit.
1997 Sep  6: SV011 to reserve orbit since this date
1997 Sep 11: SV004 to reserve orbit for 19 days, now operational
1997 Sep:    SV027 failed, stayed in parking orbit
1997 Oct:    SV036 delayed 2 weeks in move from parking orbit
1997 Nov 22: SV040 deployed to reserve orbit until Jan 27  
1997 Nov 23: SV038 deployed to reserve orbit, remains there   
1997 Dec 11: SV020 to high reserve for 9 days, now operational
1997 Dec 20: SV018 to reserve orbit since this date
1997 Dec 23: SV042 to reserve orbit since this date
1997 Dec 27: SV026 to reserve orbit for 1 month, now operational
1998 Jan 11: SV005 to reserve orbit since this date
1998 Feb  3: SV048 to reserve orbit since this date
1998 Feb 21: SV024 drifting higher, probably will move to reserve

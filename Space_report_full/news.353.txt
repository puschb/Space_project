Shuttle and Mir

RKK Energiya's automated cargo vehicle Progress 7K-TGM No. 240 was
launched on Mar 14 and named Progress M-38. Vehicle 240 is specially
modified to carry the second VDU  (Vynosnaya Dvigatel'naya Ustanovka,
External Engine Unit) propulsion unit. If vehicle 240 is similar to the
vehicle 209 (Progress M-14) which carried the first VDU in 1992, the
unit is mounted externally on a special structure between the cargo
module and the service module, replacing the OKD fuel section present on
normal Progress vehicles. The crew will spacewalk to extract the VDU
from Progress and place it on the end of a Sofora boom extending from
the Kvant module. The VDU is used to provide attitude control capability
for the station.

Launch mass of Progress M-38 was 7007 kg. By 0320 UTC on Mar 15 it had
successfully completed its first two orbital maneuvers. It replaced
Progress M-37 at the docking port on the Kvant module, with a successful
docking on Mar 16. Progress M-37 undocked on Mar 15 at 1916 UTC
and was deorbited at 2303 UTC over the Pacific.

Columbia was moved to the VAB on March 16 in preparation for STS-90.
On Mar 24 it was rolled out to pad 39B.

Recent Launches
---------------

NASA has begun drop testing of an X-38 test vehicle. The X-38 is a
project to develop a lifeboat (crew return vehicle) for the Space
Station. X-38 V-131 was dropped from a B-52 on Mar 12, flying 7 km over
Edwards AFB, and parachuted to the desert. Vehicle 131 is a subscale
test prototype, not a spaceworthy craft. Two other 130-series X-38's
will be drop tests prior to the space flight of the full-scale V-201 in
the year 2000.

Lockheed Martin Astronautics launched the last Atlas II, AC-132, from
Cape Canaveral on Mar 16. It placed a Hughes HS-601 satellite in orbit
for the US Navy. UHF Follow-On F8 is the first Block III UHF Follow-On
satellite, replacing the old FLTSATCOM satellites. It carries UHF, EHF
and Ka-band transponders, including a video broadcast payload. Future
Atlas launches will use the IIA and IIAS models, as well as the
forthcoming IIAR variant.

The French SPOT 4 remote sensing satellite was launched on Mar 24.  
Developed by Matra Marconi Space/Toulouse for CNES, the 2755 kg
satellite provides 10-m resolution images with a wide field of view.
SPOT 4 also carries a wide field 'vegetation' imager and a laser
communications experiment. Launch was by an Arianespace Ariane 40
rocket, the base Ariane 4 model with no strap-on boosters. The
liquid hydrogen fuelled third stage of the Ariane 40 entered an 800 km
sun-synchronous orbit together with SPOT 4.

The Kakehashi satellite has begun orbit raising maneuvers.

Columbia rolled out to pad 39B on Mar 23. Launch of mission
STS-90 (Neurolab) is planned for Apr 16. Columbia contains
the following cargo:
 Spacelab transfer tunnel
 Spacelab Long Module, with Neurolab experiments
 Extended Duration Orbiter pallet
 Two GAS beams with canisters G-197, G-467, G-772 and one
 other. 
The G-772 payload carries Colorado's COLLIDE experiment,
which will bang small particles into each other to simulate
the formation of planets and rings.

The Neurolab mission will carry out life science studies. It seems to be
managed by NASA-Johnson at Houston, unlike earlier Spacelab flights
which were NASA-Marshall/Huntsville's responsibility. 

Musabaev and Budarin carried out a spacewalk on Apr 1; the work ran
behind schedule and was not completed. The repaired EVA hatch was opened
at 1335 UTC and closed at 2015 UTC. The astronauts transferred to the
Spektr module and installed handrails near the damaged solar panel.
Splinting the panel will have to be done on the next spacewalk.

External Tank ET-96, the first aluminium-lithium Super Lightweight Tank,
has been mated to the solid rocket boosters for mission STS-91, which
will fly in May.

Recent Launches
---------------

Two more Motorola Iridium satellites were launched Mar 25 by a Chinese
CZ-2/SD launch vehicle from Taiyuan Space Center. The two stage CZ-2D
places the Smart Dispenser stage in transfer orbit; the SD then fires
at apogee and deploys the two satellites before moving to a lower orbit.

Five days later, a Boeing Delta 7920-10C placed a further quintet of
Iridium payloads in orbit from Space Launch Complex 2 at Vandenberg
Air Force Base. Seven more are waiting for launch on a Proton in
Kazakstan.

NASA's third Small Explorer, the Transition Region and Coronal Explorer
(TRACE), was successfully launched by an Orbital Pegasus XL on Apr 2.
The L-1011 carrier aircraft took off from Vandenberg and dropped the
Pegasus over the Pacific Ocean. TRACE was placed in a 602 x 652 km x
97.8 deg sun-synchronous orbit. This makes 11 successful flights out of
the last 12 for Pegasus, which had a rocky early history. TRACE, a
project led by Lockheed's solar physics group, carries a 30-cm extreme
ultraviolet imaging telescope which will study the Sun. The telescope
mirrors were made by the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. TRACE
has an 8.5 arcmin field of view and 1 arcsecond resolution.

TRACE is in a sun-synchronous polar orbit around the Earth, chosen so
that its plane is at  right angles to the line joining Earth and Sun.
This means that TRACE can look at the Sun all the time without Earth
getting in the way. An orbital plane will normally stay fixed relative
to the stars, and so shift relative to the Sun during the Earth's motion
around it.  The combination of TRACE's orbital height and inclination
with the gravitational effects of the Earth's flattened poles cause its
orbit to shift by exactly the amount needed to compensate for Earth's
orbital motion, keeping TRACE's orbit perpendicular to the Earth-Sun
line. Orbital inclinations between about 95 and 110 degrees (depending
on orbital height) are needed for a sun-synch orbit.

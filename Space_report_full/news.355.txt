Shuttle and Mir
---------------

Mir astronauts Solov'yov [sic: actually Musabaev]
and Budarin carried out a 4h15m spacewalk on
Apr 6 and splinted the dented Spektr solar panel. A problem with the
station's attitude control system caused the spacewalk to be cut short.
According to reports from Jim Oberg, the control center erroneously
commanded the station to stop controlling its orientation, and,
believing instead that fuel in the old VDU engine had run out, decided
to tell the crew to return inside. Andy Thomas remained on board the
station during the EVA.

Another spacewalk was carried out on Apr 11.  Hatch open was at 0955 UTC
and closed at 1620 UTC. The old VDU engine was installed in 1992,
attached to the Sofora boom sticking out from the Kvant module. Musabaev
and Budarin dismounted it and jettisoned it into space. Two more
spacewalks are planned to install the new VDU engine, currently mounted
on the exterior of the Progress supply ship.

STS-93/AXAF
-----------

AXAF is the third of NASA's Great Observatories, after the Space
Telescope (Hubble) and GRO (Compton). I expect to be giving regular
updates on the progress of the new observatory, now scheduled for launch
on Dec 3.

The Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility satellite is now
undergoing integration and test at prime contractor TRW/Redondo Beach. 
The AXAF satellite consists of a spacecraft module and a science 
instrument module (SIM) joined by a long tube called the Optical Bench
Assembly (OBA). The spacecraft module carries deployable solar panels,
the HRMA X-ray telescope, the ACA optical guide telescope,
and the IPS integral propulsion system. The IPS has four bipropellant
engine nozzles derived from TRW's DM-LAE apogee engine. AXAF will
be launched attached to an IUS solid rocket, and will completely
fill the Shuttle payload bay.

The HRMA (High Resolution Mirror Assembly) telescope consists of four
concentric grazing incidence mirrors. It's hard to persuade X-rays to
change their direction, so you can't use the usual `normal incidence'
reflective mirrors pointed at the sky, familiar in optical telescopes.
Instead, somewhat bizzarely, you point your mirror at right angles to
the incoming X-rays, and they glance off at `grazing incidence',
changing direction by only a degree or so. This is enough to let you
focus the X-rays into a picture. The resulting telescope mirror is
almost cylindrical, which lets you put progressively smaller mirrors one
inside the other.

The peer review of the first AXAF observing proposals was
carried out last week. The first year's observing was heavily 
oversubscribed, with over 700 proposals submitted. Results will be
announced next month.

Satellite Names
---------------

Since the late 1970s, NASA has made a practice of naming its
larger satellites, usually after a famous dead scientist. Other
space agencies have named their satellites after flowers, 
minerals, elementary particles, mythological characters, or
astronomical objects. I've tried to collect together a list
of these satellite names at
 http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~jcm/space/misc/names.html
Corrections and additions are welcome.


Recent Launches
---------------

Seven more Iridium satellites were launched on Apr 7. A Krunichev
three-stage Proton-K launch vehicle placed the Iridium cluster and an
Energiya commercial Blok DM2 stage (related to the domestic 17S40 Blok
DM-5 variant) in low parking orbit. The DM2 then fired twice to enter
the deployment orbit and dispensed the seven satellites, which will use
their own propulsion units to reach operational altitude. The DM2 stage
then fired again to deorbit itself, to avoid creating space debris.

Iridium constellation status:  The constellation is now filling up the
last of the six orbital planes. In addition, two satellites (SV18 and
SV38) which had been in engineering orbit for several months raised
their altitude to the operational orbit in early April. The operational
orbit is 776 x 779 km x 86.4 deg, while the engineering orbit is 765 x
771 km x 86.4 deg.  A total of 45 satellites are in operational orbit, a
further 14 are on their way there from the initial deployment orbit, two
satellites are dead, and four are in engineering orbit, for a total of 
65 Iridiums launched to date.

In my comments on sun-synchronous orbits last week, several folks
pointed out some loose statements on my part. When I suggested that
orbital planes 'normally' stay fixed, I meant when in orbit around a
perfect Newtonian point mass. Any inclined Earth satellite will have an
orbital plane precession due to the Earth's lack of spherical symmetry
(and to much smaller  degree due to GR effects). The upper inclination
limit of around 110 degrees corresponds to an upper altitude limit of
around a couple thousand km, reflecting the use of sun-synchronous
orbits in historical practice. Of course, sun-synchronous orbits at even
higher altitudes and inclinations are perfectly possible, they just
haven't tended to be used up to now.

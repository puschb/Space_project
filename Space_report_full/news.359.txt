I've updated the geostationary satellite log at

Shuttle and Mir
---------------

The next Shuttle mission is STS-91; orbiter OV-103 Discovery will dock
with Mir to pick up Andrew Thomas, the final NASA resident on the
station, and allow an inspection visit by Russian Shuttle-Mir program
director Valeriy Ryumin.

Recent Launches
---------------

The Hughes HGS-1 satellite made its final translunar injection burn
at 0042 UTC on May 8. It is now on a free-return trajectory to the Moon
with an apogee of 413600 km, and will pass 8000 km from the Moon on May 13.

Meanwhile, Hughes Global Services has moved  the Leasat 5 satellite to
156E for use  by the Australian Defence Force. The Hughes HS-381 Leasat
satellites, which originally provided UHF services for the US Navy, have
been replaced by satellites in the HS-601 class UHF Follow-On series.

An 8K78M launch vehicle (built by TsSKB-Progress of Samara) with a 2BL
fourth stage was launched from Plesetsk on May 7. It placed an Oko-class
Russian military early warning satellite in elliptical twelve-hour
orbit. The satellite, built by NPO Lavochkin of Moscow, was given the
cover name Kosmos-2351 after launch.

A Krunichev Proton-K launch vehicle placed the Echostar 4 satellite in a
213 x 35703 km x 48.5 deg geostationary transfer orbit on May 7. It
appears that contrary to reports no second burn of the Blok DM3 stage
was intended. The satellite separated from the stage near apogee, 6h 40m
into the flight. On May 11, Echostar 4 was in a 12263 x 35747 km x 10.6
deg orbit after a burn of its Leros liquid apogee engine. Echostar 4 is
an A2100AX class comsat built by Lockheed Martin/Sunnyvale for Echostar
Comms. Corp. of Littleton, Colorado. Launch services were provided by
International Launch Services (the Lockheed/Krunichev/Energiya joint
venture).

A classified NRO satellite was launched on May 9 from Cape Canaveral,
probably to geostationary orbit. The Lockheed Martin Astronautics Titan
4B rocket (serial B-25) has two SRMU solid boosters and a two-stage
Titan liquid rocket core (serial K-25). The second stage delivered
Centaur TC-18 and the payload to a suborbital trajectory. The TC-18
liquid hydrogen-fuelled upper stage made three rocket burns to deliver
the satellite to geostationary orbit. The satellite is believed to be a
follow-on to the ORION signals intelligence satellite. The first ORION
follow-on was launched in May 1995.

The correct flight model numbers of the recently launched Globalstar
satellites are FM-6,8,14 and 15.

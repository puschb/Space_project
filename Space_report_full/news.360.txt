Shuttle and Mir
---------------

The next Shuttle mission is STS-91; orbiter OV-103 Discovery will dock
with Mir to pick up Andrew Thomas, the final NASA resident on the
station, and allow an inspection visit by Russian Shuttle-Mir program
director Valeriy Ryumin. Charles Precourt and Dominic Gorie will  be
commander and pilot, with payload commander Franklin Chang-Diaz and
mission specialists Wendy Lawrence and Janet Kavandi. Dr. Chang-Diaz, a
member of the 1980 group of astronauts, will be making his sixth space
flight, equalling the record set by John Young and Story Musgrave.
Ryumin has been involved in the design and development of all of the DOS
orbital stations from Salyut to Mir, and made three flights in the
Salyut-6 program in 1977-1980, becoming at that time the spaceflight
duration record holder.

Russia launched the Progress 7K-TGM (11F615A55) No. 238 cargo ship  from
Baykonur on May 14. Progress spacecraft 238 was renamed Progress M-39
after launch. It docked with Mir at 2351 UTC on May 16, bringing
supplies and scientific experiments to the station. Progress M-38
undocked May 15 at 1844 UTC, freeing up the docking port on the Kvant
module for the new cargo ship.

Recent Launches
---------------

The NOAA K weather satellite was launched on May 13 from Vandenberg, and
renamed NOAA 15 on reaching orbit. NOAA K is an Advanced Tiros N class
weather satellite built by Lockheed Martin/East Windsor for the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Polar Orbiting Environmental
Satellite (POES) program. NOAA K carries a new microwave sensor as well
as the usual complement of optical/near-infrared radiometers and imagers
and the SARSAT search and rescue package. It was the first NOAA launch
to use the Titan 23G launch vehicle, a refurbished ICBM. Titan 23G-12
took off from Space Launch Complex 4-West at Vandenberg and delivered
NOAA K into a suborbital trajectory 6 min later. A Thiokol (Cordant
Technologies) Star 37XFP solid motor on the satellite fired at apogee to
put NOAA K in orbit; this is a more powerful version of the Star 37S
orbit insertion motor used on earlier Tiros N satellites.

Another successful launch for the Boeing Delta 2 placed five
more Motorola Iridium satellites in orbit on May 17. This is the
final launch in the initial deployment of the Iridium constellation,
but launches of replacement satellites will continue.
I don't have the satellite numbers for the new launch yet;
the next free numbers are SV 70,72,73,74,75.

The Blok DM3 stage for the May 7 Proton launch did indeed make two burns
(see last week's issue). The second burn left Echostar in an 8318 x
35750 km x 15.3 deg orbit; the liquid apogee motor raised perigee to
12263 km a few days later. No element sets for the second burn transfer
orbit reached the Goddard web site at the time, but a Space Command
element set later reached the JPL archive sites.

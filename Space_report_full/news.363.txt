Shuttle and Mir
---------------

Discovery docked with the SO module on Mir at 1700 UTC on June 4. Andy
Thomas became part of the Discovery crew, Valeriy Ryumin carried out an
inspection tour of Mir, and NASA equipment was retrieved from the
station. Discovery undocked at 1601 UTC on Jun 8, ending NASA
participation in the Mir program. STS-91 landed on Runway 15 at Kennedy
Space Center at 1800 UTC on Jun 12. Discovery is now in Orbiter
Processing Bay 2 and will be turned around to perform the next Shuttle
mission, STS-95 in October.

The lack of Ku-band coverage meant that the AMS experiment was
only able to send back a small amount of data in real time, but 
reportedly AMS did detect cosmic-ray antiprotons as expected.

GRAB Declassified
------------------

On Jun 17 the National Reconnaissance Office and the Naval Research Lab
(NRO and NRL) declassified GRAB, the first signals intelligence satellite.
GRAB was first launched in June 1960, shortly before the first successful
flight of the CORONA imaging satellite. It carried receivers to
catalog and characterize Soviet air defence radars. It also carried
a scientific solar X-ray detector as a cover story - the satellite was
given the cover name SOLRAD. It was launched together with TRANSIT 2A.
Five  GRAB satellites were launched, not counting an inert dummy used
to prove the dual satellite launching technique. The declassification
did not reveal which the other satellites were, but my reconstruction is:

Dummy      1960 Apr 13 (with Transit 1B)
 GRAB 1    1960 Jun 22  (with Transit 2A)
 GRAB 2    1960 Nov 30 (with Transit 3A, failed to orbit)
 GRAB 3    1961 Jun 29 (with Transit 4A, second success)
 GRAB 4    1962 Jan 24 (with other NRL satellites, failed to orbit)
 GRAB 5    1962 Apr 26  (on a Scout, failed to orbit)
 
At the time,  the name GREB was used in open sources some of the time,
presumably just a misprint. GRAB stands for Galactic Radiation And Background,
while GREB supposedly stood for Galactic Radiation Experiment Background.
Neither  name makes much sense.

After mid-1962 , GRAB successor satellites were launched
under the auspices of the NRO, but these haven't been declassified yet.

The GRAB satellite was NRL's first satellite after the Vanguard program,
and it used the 20-inch Vanguard sphere as its structure. Thus, the
purely civilian Vanguard program quickly led to a military successor;
work on GRAB began around the time of the first successful Vanguard launch.
GRAB data was given by NRL to both Strategic Air Command (to help
bombers figure out how to avoid Soviet radars) and NSA.
See my 1997 JBIS paper (Vol 50, p 427) for more on NRL's early satellites.

While at NRL, I got to see the flight ICM (Interim Control Module for
Space Station). ICM has APAS type docking ports on each face. It is
launched in the Shuttle attached to a large cylindrical fairing at the
far end of wh ich are trunnions  which attach to the payload bay.
Apparently ICM and cylinder swing up out of the bay somehow and then ICM
is placed on the ODS  by the RMS arm?  The Shuttle/ICM then docks with
the Zarya tug. No word on when ICM will fly; that still depends on the
politics of persuading the Russian government to support completion of
the SM module. The ICM vehicle has some propulsion work still to do
and doesn't have its docking ports yet, but I understand things are
moving full steam ahead.

I also got to hear a talk by Milt Rosen, parent of the Viking and
Vanguard rockets, who seems in fine form and gave an engaging account
of the Vanguard program, emphasizing its successes in the end, seeding
NASA's space science program and leading to the Delta rocket. Likewise
Roger Easton, who talked about the early NRL and rival proposals which
led to the GPS navigation satellites.

Recent Launches
---------------

A Hughes HS-376HP spin-stabilized comsat, Thor III, was launched for
Telenor Satellite Services AS of Oslo by Boeing on Jun 11. The Delta
7925 launch vehicle placed Thor III in geostationary transfer orbit.
Delta's second stage entered a low circular orbit, then raised apogee to
about 1400 km, then in a third burn circularized at that altitude and
separated from the third stage, which  delivered the payload to a high
perigee transfer orbit. The Delta stage 2 then made a fourth burn to
lower perigee again so that it would reenter quickly. The Thor III
satellite will use a Thiokol Star 30 motor to circularize its orbit
at geostationary altitude.

The RVSN (Russian Strategic Rocket Forces) launched six Strela-3
military communications satellites on Jun 15 with a 11K68 Tsiklon-3
launch vehicle. The circularization burn by the S5M third stage seems to
have gone awry, leaving the satellites in a more elliptical orbit than
usual, 1300 x 1900 km. The RVSN is quoting this as the first multiple
launch by the Rocket Forces, which is  not quite true - RVSN's space
forces did multiple launches since the early 1960s, but those space
forces were later made an independent agency, the VKS. This is the first
multiple launch since the VKS was disbanded last year and launch
operations returned to the authority of the RVSN.

A Minuteman ICBM was probably launched on a  suborbital flight test from
Vandenberg's LF-26 silo to Kwajalein missile range on June 3. I haven't
had confirmation of the flight yet.

Alan Shepard
------------

The second human in space, Alan Bartlett Shepard, Jr., died Jul 22 (UTC)
in Monterey, California of leukemia at the age of 74. Shepard was the
pilot of Freedom Seven (Mercury Spacecraft 7), which was launched on the
MR-3 suborbital flight on 1961 May 5. Shepard was also the commander
of Apollo 14, the third lunar landing mission.

The first 20 humans in space (by the 80 km definition I choose to adopt)
were:
 Yuriy Alexeevich Gagarin          (1934-1968) 3KA No. 3 "Vostok"
 Alan Bartlett Shepard, Jr.        (1923-1998) Mercury SC7 "Freedom Seven"
 Virgil Ivan Grissom               (1926-1967) Mercury SC11 "Liberty Bell 7"
 German Stepanovich Titov          (1935-    ) 3KA No. 4 "Vostok-2"
 John Herschel Glenn, Jr.          (1921-    ) Mercury SC13 "Friendship Seven"
 Malcolm Scott Carpenter           (1925-    ) Mercury SC18 "Aurora Seven"
 Robert Michael White              (1924-    ) X-15-3 Flight 3-7-14
 Andriyan Grigorevich Nikolaev     (1929-    ) 3KA No. 5 "Vostok-3"
 Pavel Romanovich Popovich         (1930-    ) 3KA No. 6 "Vostok-4"
 Walter Marty Schirra, Jr          (1923-    ) Mercury SC16 "Sigma Seven"
 Joseph Albert Walker              (1921-1966) X-15-3 Flight 3-14-24
 Leroy Gordon Cooper, Jr           (1927-    ) Mercury SC20 "Faith Seven"
 Valeriy Fyodorovich Bykovskiy     (1934-    ) 3KA No. 7 "Vostok-5"
 Valentina Vladimirovna Tereshkova (1937-   )  3KA No. 8 "Vostok-6"
 Robert Aitken Rushworth           (1924-1993) X-15-3 Flight 3-20-31
 Vladimir Mikhailovich Komarov     (1927-1967) 3KV No. 3 "Voskhod"
 Konstantin Petrovich Feoktistov   (1926-   )  3KV No. 3 "Voskhod"
 Boris Borisovich Yegorov          (1937-1994) 3KV No. 3 "Voskhod"
 Pavel Ivanovich Belyaev           (1925-1970) 3KD No. 4 "Voskhod-2"
 Aleksei Arkhipovich Leonov        (1934-    ) 3KD No. 4 "Voskhod-2"


Get Well, Bill
--------------

CBS space correspondent Bill Harwood was injured in a car crash on Jul
11. Bill's site  http://uttm.com/space/ is one of the best sources on
Shuttle news. Let's hope Bill makes a speedy recovery.

Shuttle and Mir
---------------

The next Shuttle mission is STS-95, in October. 


The EO-25 crew of Talgat Musabaev and Nikolai Budarin are continuing
work aboard the Mir complex. The EO-26 crew of Gennadiy Padalka and
Sergey Avdeev, together with Yuriy Baturin, will  be launched on Soyuz
TM-28 on Aug 13. Musabaev, Budarin and Baturin land in Soyuz TM-27 on
Aug 25. The EO-27 crew at launch on 1999 Feb 22 is Viktor Afanas'ev and
two cosmonaut-researchers, Jean-Pierre Haignere of France and Ivan Bella
of Slovakia. According to some reports, Haignere and Bella will land on
Mar 2 in Soyuz TM-28, with the long stay EO-28 crew becoming Afanas'ev
and Avdeev; however it seems likely that Haignere will in fact replace
Avdeev on the long-stay crew. Finally, on 1999 Jun 1 the crew will
depart Mir in Soyuz TM-29 and land, with the Mir complex being deorbited
a week later. This schedule, of course, is almost certain to change.

Recent Launches
---------------

In addition to the satellites mentioned in JSR 366, a fifth
microsatellite was launched along with Resurs-O1 No. 4 on Jul 10.  The
WESTPAC (formerly WPLTN-1) geodesy satellite is a copy of Potsdam's
GFZ-1 satellite, a sphere covered with laser retroreflectors, with a
slightly different `Fizeau' corner cube design. It is a target for the
Western Pacific Laser Tracking Network (WPLTN) and is a joint project of
Electro Optic Systems of Queanbeyan, New South Wales, Australia, and the
Russian Space Agency. Mass is around 24 kg and diameter around 0.24m.
The WPLTN is headquartered in Australia and Space Command has cataloged
the satellite as Australian. AUSLIG (Australian Surveying and Land
Information Group), part of the Australian Federal Govt., may be the
actual satellite owner.

China launched a Chang Zheng 3B on Jul 18 at 0920 UTC carrying the
Sinosat 1 communications satellite. The CZ-3B's liquid hydrogen upper
stage and the Sinosat were placed in a 609 x 35958 km x 19.0 deg
geostationary transfer orbit at 0945 UTC. The first two liquid apogee
burns were carried out on Jul 19 and 21. Sinosat is an Alcatel (formerly
Aerospatiale) Spacebus 3000 class satellite, built at the Cannes
facility. Launch mass was 2820 kg. Sinosat is owned temporarily by
EurasSpace, a joint venture between Daimler-Benz Aerospace  and the
China Aerospace Corp., and will be delivered after on-orbit testing to
Sino Satellite Communications Co. of Shanghai for communications
services in China. Thanks to Stefan Barensky for details.

Aleksandr Zheleznyakov reports that the Molniya-3 launch time was
0048 UT on Jul 1.

The Galileo Orbiter had a safemode event at around 1814 UTC on Jul 20
 during its inbound approach to the inner Jovian system, causing loss of
almost all the data from the Europa 16 encounter. Telemetry from the
spacecraft has now resumed. Galileo passed 1837 km from Europa's surface
at 0507 UTC on Jul 21, just after perijove at 632000 km radius, at 0019
UTC on Jul 21.

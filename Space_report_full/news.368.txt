Shuttle and Mir
---------------

The next Shuttle mission is STS-95, in October.  Although I am still
sceptical of the proposed launch dates for STS-88 and STS-93, things
seem stable enough at the moment that I've started listing them again
below.


Recent Launches
---------------

Titan 4A-20 exploded 42 seconds after launch from Cape Canaveral on Aug
12. The vehicle was a Lockheed Martin Titan 4A-Centaur model, the last
4A and the last with the UTC/CSD solid rocket boosters to be launched;
all future Titan 4s will be Titan 4Bs and will have Alliant SRMU solid
rocket boosters. The payload is thought to have been a signals
intelligence satellite, one of the follow-ons to the VORTEX series. 
Earlier payloads in the series were launched in Aug 1994 and Apr 1996.
The Titan 4 seems to have pitched over 40s after launch, implying a
probable guidance failure. The vehicle would then have exploded due to
structural failure, as it is not designed to survive flying sideways. 

Kosmos-2360 was launched on Jul 28 by a Zenit-2 launch vehicle
from Baykonur. Kosmos-2360 is a Tselina-2 electronic intelligence
satellite built by the Yuzhnoe company in Dnepropetrovsk,
Ukraine. 

8 small Orbcomm communications satellites were launched on Aug 2. The
L-1011 carrier aircraft took off from Wallops Island with a Pegasus
XL/HAPS rocket aboard. The rocket was launched 100 km E of the Virginia
coast (I have been unable to find out the latitude and longitude, if
anyone knows them please let me know). The Pegasus XL has three
solid stages which delivered the Orbcomm/HAPS stack to a suborbital
trajectory. The first burn of the HAPS hydrazine engine placed the stack
in an elliptical transfer orbit, and a second burn circularized the
orbit at apogee, followed shortly by deployment of the eight
disk-shaped payloads. Orbcomm is a subsdiary of Orbital Sciences Corp.,
which builds the Pegasus rocket.

Web site updates
----------------

I've updated my edited version of the United Nations Registry
of Space Objects, at 
 http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~jcm/space/un/un.html
Member states of the UN are required to register space objects owned by
them; the accuracy and completeness of the information provided is
pretty spotty. The United States remains the state with the most errors
and omissions in its submissions; Mexico, Germany, Australia, and Brazil
are grossly overdue in updating their registrations. The US should be
registering INTELSAT's satellites, but does not; the United Kingdom
should be registering INMARSAT's satellites, but does not.  Since 1991,
when the US last failed to register one of its classified satellites,
there is no evidence of any state deliberately failing to register a
satellite to avoid detection - the omissions seem to be due to
sloppiness.

I've also updated the geostationary log at
 http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~jcm/space/jsr/geo.html
including the addition of manufacturer's names and serial numbers for
Russian/Soviet geostationary satellites, as revealed in Novosti
Kosmonavtiki magazine. The full satellite catalog at
 http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~jcm/space/jsr/satcat 
has also been updated and extensively revised.

Shuttle and Mir
---------------

Soyuz TM-28 was launched at 0943:10 UTC on Aug 13. The spacecraft,
production vehicle 7K-STM 11F732 No. 77, is built by RKK Energiya and
consists of a service module (priborno-agregatniy otsek), a descent
module (spuskaemiy apparat) and a hab module (bitovoy otsek). Crew on
this flight are air force officer Gennadiy Padalka, EO-26 crew
commander; RKK Energiya engineer Sergey Avdeev, flight engineer; and 
cosmonaut-researcher Yuriy Baturin, who is the former head of the
Russian Federation Defence Council. Soyuz TM-28 docked at 1056 UTC on
Aug 15 with the rear (Kvant) port of the Mir space station, which was
vacated at 0928UTC on Aug 12 by the Progress M-39 cargo ship. 
The EO-25 crew, Musabaev and Budarin, will land with Baturin on
Aug 25, leaving the EO-26 crew of Padalka and Avdeev on the station.

Recent Launches
---------------

It now appears that the advanced VORTEX-type satellites like the one
lost in the Titan 4A-20 explosion on Aug 12 are probably called MERCURY,
as suggested in COUNTDOWN magazine for Jan 1995. However, these code
names are usually changed as soon as they become public. The rumours
that the satellite was built by Hughes turn out to be pretty weak; TRW
or Lockheed Martin are more likely contractors. The communications
intelligence program has been operated since its first launch in 1968 by
the USAF program within the National Reconnaissance Office, on behalf of
the National Security Agency. A first generation series, CANYON, was
based on the Agena vehicle. A later improvement in 1972 had a heavier
but similar payload which separated from the Agena. This was followed by
the more advanced CHALET (renamed VORTEX when the name CHALET appeared
in the New York Times) and then by the new satellites probably called
MERCURY. I have reconstructed the launch history based on unclassified
documents and media reports:

Flight  Codename   Launch date   Launch vehicle
No      at launch

--- First generation, Agena attached ---

1       CANYON    1968 Aug  6  Atlas Agena D
2       CANYON    1969 Apr 13  Atlas Agena D
3       CANYON    1970 Sep  1  Atlas Agena D
4       CANYON    1971 Dec  4  Atlas Agena D (failed to orbit)

--- Improved version, Agena separated ---

5       CANYON    1972 Dec 20  Atlas Agena D
6       CANYON    1975 Jun 18  Atlas Agena D
7       CANYON    1977 May 23  Atlas Agena D

--- Second generation, Titan launch ---

8       CHALET    1978 Jun 10  Titan 3C
9       VORTEX    1979 Oct  1  Titan 3C
10      VORTEX    1981 Oct 31  Titan 3C
11      VORTEX    1984 Jan 31  Titan 34D/Transtage
12      VORTEX    1988 Sep  2  Titan 34D/Transtage (upper stage failed)
13      VORTEX    1989 May 10  Titan 34D/Transtage

--- Third generation ---

14      MERCURY   1994 Aug 27  Titan 4A/Centaur
15      MERCURY   1996 Apr 24  Titan 4A/Centaur
16      MERCURY   1998 Aug 12  Titan 4A/Centaur  (failed to orbit)

Aviation Week reported that there were 15 payloads in the program
launched since the late 1970s, which is almost certainly wrong. They
also imply that the latest satellite is `the same' payload as the
earlier ones, but the larger Titan 4 payload shroud makes it almost
certain that the antenna is significantly larger than the CHALET/VORTEX
series, even if the basic satellite bus is the same.

In addition to the CANYON/CHALET/VORTEX/MERCURY program used for
communications intelligence, there was another geostationary signals
intelligence program led by the CIA program within the NRO. The Aviation
Week article suggests that those satellites are now called ORION, but that
name was `outed' some years ago and has probably been changed by now;
just as the MERCURY was referred to by analysts as `Advanced VORTEX'
when its true name was unknown, the latest satellites are probably best
referred to as `Advanced ORION' until their true codename is leaked.
Launch history of the CIA-originated geostationary sigint program (now
integrated with the rest of the NRO SIGINT series) is as follows:

--- First generation ---

1       RHYOLITE   1970 Jun 19  Atlas Agena D
2       RHYOLITE   1973 Mar  6  Atlas Agena D
3       AQUACADE   1977 Dec 11  Atlas Agena D
4       AQUACADE   1978 Apr  8  Atlas Agena D

--- Second generation ---

5       MAGNUM     1985 Jan 25  Shuttle/IUS
6       ORION      1989 Nov 23  Shuttle/IUS

--- Third generation? ---

7       ORION?     1995 May 14  Titan 4A/Centaur
8       ORION?     1998 May  9  Titan 4B/Centaur

The early satellites in this series were built by TRW, and the early
ones were compromised by spies in the mid-1970s. I don't know who builds
the ORION craft, but it may well still be TRW.

Meanwhile, salvage work on the Titan wreckage continues at the Cape,
but there's no word yet on the reason for the failure.


Another attempt to redock the Hikoboshi and Orihime satellites was
unsuccessful on Aug 13. Further attempts will be made, while for the
time being the two Japanese test satellites remain a few kilometers
apart.

Two more Iridium cellphone satellites were launched on Aug 19 from
Taiyuan in China. The CZ-2C two-stage launch vehicle placed the Smart
Dispenser bus in elliptical transfer orbit; the SD then fired to
circularize the orbit, deployed the satellites, and fired again to lower
its perigee and ensure rapid reentry. The new satellites, placed in
plane 2, include satellite production number 3, which was kept as a
ground test article until now.

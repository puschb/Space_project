Shuttle and Mir
---------------

Soyuz TM-27 undocked from Mir at 0205 UTC on Aug 25, with Talgat
Musabaev, Nikolai Budarin and Yuriy Baturin aboard. They landed on Aug
25 at 0523 UTC near Arkalyk in Kazakstan. Gennadiy Padalka and Sergey
Avdeev remain on the Mir complex.

Padalka and Avdeev boarded Soyuz TM-28 on Aug 27 and undocked 
from the Kvant port on the Mir complex, redocking at 0607 UTC
at the front (-X) port of the PKhO transfer module. This leaves
the Kvant port free for redocking of the Progress M-39 cargo ship,
which undocked earlier in the month to free up a parking space.

Recent Launches
---------------

The first Delta III launch vehicle was lost 75 seconds into flight, 16
km above Cape Canaveral, on Aug 27. Boeing Expendable Launch Systems
(formerly McDonnell Douglas) builds the Delta III at Huntington Beach,
California with final assembly in Pueblo, Colorado. The standard Delta
II model is widely regarded as one of the world's most reliable launch
vehicles. While I expect that the Delta team will recover from this
failure and eventually bring the new rocket up to the same standard, the
loss of the initial vehicle is certainly a major blow for Boeing and for
the US space launch industry; although it represents less money than the
recent Titan failure, it will probably have a wider impact. The Delta
III consists of:

 - Nine Alliant GEM-46 solid strapon motors, a scaled up version of the
   GEM-40 motors used on the Delta II 7925. The graphite-epoxy case
   motors use HTPB solid propellant. The motors are built in Alliant's
   Bacchus, Utah factory; Alliant was formerly known as Hercules Powder
   and built the upper stage for the first Delta back in 1960.
   Three of the GEM-46 motors have thrust vector control (TVC), in which
   movable nozzles are used to steer the rocket.

 - The Delta III First Stage, similar to the Delta II first stage, but
   with the fuel tank at the top reshaped to fit with the wider upper stage.
   It uses the same LOX/kerosene RS-27A main engine as the Delta II.

 - The Delta III Second Stage. This is an entirely new stage, and the
   first entirely new high energy upper stage developed in the US since
   the 1960s. It uses a Pratt and Whitney LOX/liquid hydrogen RL10B-2
   engine with a long extensible nozzle built by SEP of France. The 
   RL10B-2, with a world record specific impulse of over 462 seconds,
   is a new version of the venerable RL10 engine used in the 
   Lockheed Martin Astronautics Centaur, the other US high energy upper stage.
   The liquid hydrogen tank for the Delta III second stage is build by
   Mitsubishi of Japan, which also builds the liquid hydrogen stage of the
   Japanese H-II rocket. The Delta III second stage is 4.0m in diameter,
   much larger than the Delta II stage which still uses tankage derived
   in part from the 1960-vintage Ablestar. However, the appearance of the 
   new stage, with the narrower LOX tank held inside an interstage and 
   the large nozzle assembly, is still reminiscent of the traditional 
   Delta stage.

 - The 4.0 meter fairing, much larger than the old 10-foot Delta II fairing.
   Boeing also builds the large Titan IV fairings, so has lots of experience
   in this field.

Delta III has about twice the launch capacity of the Delta II. The
launch profile involves igniting the RS-27A main engine and six of the
GEM-46 solids at launch. At 80 seconds into flight the six solids 
separate and the remaining three GEM-46 solids ignite.  Initially it
appeared that the failure happened at exactly this time, raising the 
possibility that Alliant's new GEM-46 graphite-epoxy case motors were
implicated in the failure. However, latest info is that pitch and yaw
control gave problems as early as 50 seconds into flight, the hydraulic
fluid ran out on the three GEM-46 with TVC steering, the vehicle
disintegrated around 72 seconds and its self-destruct signal fired.
Range safety sent its own destruct signal at 75 seconds for good
measure. The accident investigation now focusses on the rocket's
guidance.

The planned launch profile included a first burn of the second stage
engine from T+4min to T+13 min, leaving Delta in a 157 x 1176 km parking
orbit. After a 9 minute coast, the stage would burn again to enter a 185
x 35719 km x 27.5 deg geostationary transfer orbit, separating from the
Galaxy 10 satellite payload.

Galaxy 10, the payload destroyed in this launch, was a Hughes HS-601HP
satellite built by Hughes/El Segundo for Panamsat. The satellite carried
24 C-band and 24 Ku-band transponders to provide US/Caribbean coverage,
and was to have replaced the aging SBS-5 satellite at 123 deg West.
Launch mass of Galaxy 10 was 3876 kg; I haven't been able to find its
dry mass. Replenishing the Galaxy/PAS constellation is a high priority
for Panamsat following the loss of Galaxy 4 and problems with Galaxy 7.
Galaxy 11 is scheduled to go up on the first launch of another rocket,
the Sea Launch Zenit-3SL, early next year, and there are several PAS
satellites awaiting launch over the next year on Proton and Ariane.

Arianespace is back in action, after several months downtime when their
customers were late getting payloads ready. An Ariane 44P launched the
Singapore-Taiwan-1 (ST-1) satellite on Aug 25. The Matra Marconi Space
Eurostar 2000 class satellite will provide communications for Singapore
Telecom and for Chunghwa Telecom of Taiwan. On Aug 29, ST-1 was in a
24937 x 35735 km x 0.3 deg orbit, using its liquid apogee motor to
approach geostationary orbit.

Another International Launch Services commercial Proton, serial 383-01,
took off from Baykonur on Aug 30. It placed the Astra 2A satellite in a
220 x 36007 km x 51.6 deg transfer orbit with the first burn of its Blok
DM3 upper  stage (a second burn is awaited at the time of writing). The
Astra 2A satellite is another Hughes HS-601 comsat, and is owned by
Societe Europeene de Satellites, based in Luxembourg. Luxembourg has not
registered any of the Astra satellites with the United Nations, in
violation of treaty requirements.

I've corrected some errors in the geo.log file I posted last week.
Thanks to Tony Vitek for spotting the mistakes.

Shuttle and Mir
---------------

The Progress M-39 cargo ship redocked at the +X port of the
37KE (Kvant) module on the Mir complex. Soyuz TM-28 is docked
at the -X port on the PKhO BB (Base block transfer compartment).


Recent Launches
---------------

* North Korean satellite?

The Democratic People's Republic of Korea (Choson Minjujuui In'min
Konghwaguk, North Korea) launched a Taepo Dong 1 missile  at 0307 UTC on
Aug 31.  North Korea now claims that a third stage on the missile placed
a small satellite in orbit.  US sources so far have reported the
launching as a  suborbital missile test, and have not tracked any
satellite in orbit. However, it's possible that a small satellite could
have been missed. The satellite is reportedly broadcasting Korean
propaganda songs on 27 MHz.  I'm provisionally assuming the  Korean
reports are correct despite the lack of confirmation from Space Command.
It seems probable that a satellite launch was at least attempted, but
we'll have to wait a few days before it's clear whether or not it did
reach orbit.

Launch site is given as Musudan-ri, Hamgyong Pukdo Province. My research
indicates this is Cape Musudan at 40.52N 129.45E. ("-ri" is a small
administrative district). The claimed orbit is  218 x 6978 km x 41 deg.
The Taepo Dong 1 (TD-1) reportedly consists of a Nodong 2 first stage
with a Scud-class second stage. The third (orbital) stage is probably a
small solid motor.  No name has been given to the satellite in the North
Korean announcements.
    
The figures in the North Korean press release are inconsistent. They say
that launch was at 86 degrees azimuth, and the first stage fell 253 km
downrange at 40.85N 139.67E, the second stage 1646 km downrange at
40.22N 149.12E. The claim for the first stage is clearly wrong, it's
much more than 253 km from N Korea and practically on the beach in
Japan. I have two scenarios:

 (1) The only error is that the first stage impact longitude should
 be 129.67E, not 139.67E. Then the range to the second stage impact
 point is correct, and the path is 86 degrees measuring east from south.
 The first stage impact point is then just of Cape Musu-dan and the
 launch site is unrelated to the cape, being at 126.2E 41.0N
 near Manpojin right on the Chinese border. This seems really unlikely,
 since the Korean statement about the location of the launching site
 is so detailed.    
            
 (2) The launch site is at Cape Musu-dan, the azimuth is 86 deg
 measuring east from north (the conventional way), the ranges
 are correct but the latitudes and longitudes are all wrong. Then
 I derive a first stage impact point of 40.7N 133.0E, and a second
 stage impact point of 41.5N 152.1E. This seems much more likely,
 except that I can't explain why the Korean latitude and longitude
 figures would be so wrong. 

Meanwhile, the Republic of Korea (Tae han Min'guk, South Korea) has not
yet got a satellite launch vehicle of its own, although it has several
satellites launched by other nations' rockets:

(Uribyol means 'our star'; Mugunghwa is the national flower
of Korea, the Sharon's rose.)

In addition, the Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI) has a
sounding rocket program using the single-stage solid fuel KSR-I sounding
rocket and the KSR-II, which uses two stages each based on the KSR-I.
There have been four launches to date from the Anhueng launch site in
Ch'ungch'ong Namdo province, at 36.41N 126.10E.

  KSR-II-2  1998 Jun 11    Ozone/ionosphere/X-ray astron, 137 km

Thanks to Kim Jhoon and Park Jeongjoo of KARI for their generous
help in providing details of the South Korean space program.
I would like to particularly encourage my readers in South Korea (or for
that matter North Korea, in the unlikely event I have any there!) to
pass on to me any corrections they may have to this report.


* ETS-7

Meanwhile, the ETS-7 Orihime and Hikoboshi satellites have successfully
redocked, following attitude control software problems which threatened
the mission. This is very good news for NASDA, the Japanese applications
space agency.

* Astra 2A

Astra 2A's Blok DM3 stage delivered the payload to a 7932 x 35991 km x
15.6 deg transfer orbit following a successful second burn on Aug 30.
Astra 2A's on-board Marquardt R-4D bipropellant liquid apogee engine
will be used for the rest of the journey to geostationary orbit.

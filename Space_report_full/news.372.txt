Shuttle and Mir
---------------

Gennadiy Padalka and Sergey Avdeev have completed one month in space,
continuing their mission on the Mir orbital station. They are scheduled
to make an internal spacewalk into the depressurized Spektr module on
Sep 15 to repair a solar panel steering motor.

Orbiter OV-103 Discovery will be  rolled to the Vehicle Assembly
Building's High Bay 1 on Sep 14 and connected to external tank ET-98 and
solid rocket booster pair RSRM-68, which have been assembled on Mobile
Launch Platform 2. Rollout of the assembled Space Shuttle vehicle to pad
39B is scheduled for Sep 21. Discovery will fly mission STS-95,
with the Spartan solar observatory and the Spacehab research module.

Meanwhile, launch of the first Space Station element, the Zarya FGB
module, is still scheduled for November, although Keith Cowing's NASA
Watch web site, http://www.reston.com/nasa/watch.html, rumours that a
further major launch delay is being considered. Apparently the Service
Module delivery date may slip to around July 1999, and RKA does not have
the funds to build enough Soyuz and Progress supply ships. No up to date
information is available from official sources, and since both US and
Russian administrations have other priorities right now, any decision is
unlikely until at least October.

Recent Launches

* Kwangmyongsong 1: the mystery continues

The mystery of the North Korean launch continues. It now seems unlikely
that the satellite reached orbit. A Russian press report said that
Russian sources confirmed the satellite, but just repeated the North
Korean figures, so cannot be considered as an independent source.
Comments from US sources imply that a third stage burn was observed, but
that nothing was later spotted on radar, suggesting that the satellite
ended up falling into the Pacific instead of reaching orbit. I am
cataloging it as a failed orbital launch attempt for now.

The KCNA (North Korean news agency) informs me that the name of the
satellite is "Kwangmyongsong No 1", meaning "Bright Light Star". They
also confirm that there was a typo in the initial press release - the
impact site of the first stage was at 132deg 40'E, a much more
reasonable value, although still a few hundred km from the figure quoted
in Aviation Week as coming from the Japanese. A Korean colleague informs
me that Nodong (the previous N Korean missile) means 'Labour', as in
'Korean Labour Party'. and Taepo means `cannon'.

*Zenit fails again

The Zenit launch vehicle, built by Yuzhnoe of Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine,
continued its mixed record with a failure in its first major commercial
launch.  Counting the North Korean launch, this makes four launch
failures in a single month - not a good time for the space launch
industry.

Twelve Globalstar communications satellites were lost when the Zenit
guidance system malfunctioned 4.5 minutes after launch and the second
stage and payloads impacted Siberia. The twelve satellites were stacked
in three tiers of four each inside the Zenit fairing. The second stage
engines shut down and the second stage and payloads impacted somewhere
in Siberia. The failure happened at T+272s, just before fairing
separation, and caused the stage 2 main engines to shut down.  In an
incredibly stupid move, the Yuzhnoe launch commentator was reading from
a prepared script instead of actually delivering live information,
initially leading Globalstar officials to believe the launch had
succeeded.

The Globalstar comsats are built by Alenia (Torino) and SS/Loral (Palo
Alto) for Globalstar Corp. Eight Globalstars are already in orbit.
Future Zenit launches for Globalstar are to be cancelled,  with Soyuz-U/Ikar
and Delta 7420 taking up the slack. Total constellation size will now be
44 satellites (36 prime plus eight spares). 

Here is a summary of the Globalstar satellites so far:

* Iridium launch

Boeing's Delta II made a successful flight on Sep 8, placing five
Iridium communications satellites in parking orbit after launch from
Vandenberg AFB. The problems with the new Delta III were determined not
to affect the Delta II. This variant was a two-stage Delta 7920-10C, 
which placed SV77,79-82 in a 520 km parking orbit. The Iridium
satellites will use their own on-board propulsion to raise their orbits.

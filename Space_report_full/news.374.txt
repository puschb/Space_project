Jonathan's Space Report
No. 374 draft                              1998 Oct  5  Cambridge, MA

Editorial
---------

I have updated the satellite catalog 
http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~jcm/space/log/satcat.txt
and released a major new product - the master log of all orbital launches,
with as many launch times, launch vehicle serial numbers, pads, etc.
as I've been able to dig up. This is at
http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~jcm/space/log/launch.html
It includes a 1Mb text file about 180 columns wide, launchlog.txt.
Those of you who love this kind of dataset (you know who you are),
please feed back any errors you find.


Orbital Launch Sites
--------------------

As part of preparing the launch log, I've come up with a revised
list of orbital launch sites.

I apologize for the mixed use of (degrees minutes) and decimal degrees
in the latitudes and longitudes. The abbreviations on the left are my own.
Note that Baykonur and Plesetsk have changed their designations over the
years. I've counted San Marco as a mobile sea launch complex, since
that was its original design even though they never got around to moving
it.

Shuttle and Mir
---------------

The next Shuttle mission is STS-95, with orbiter OV-103 Discovery.


Errata
-------

The Orbcomm launch on Sep 23 was at 0506 UTC, not 1706 UTC
as I said in last week's text.

PAS 3R is over the Atlantic at 44W, not over the Indian Ocean;
I confused it with Measat 1 which was launched at the same time.

Recent Launches
---------------


* Kosmos-2361?

A satellite was launched on Sep 28 for the Russian Defence Ministry and
reported as a Kosmos satellite; it would then be Kosmos-2361.  Usually,
Kosmos satellites launched on the 8K78M launch vehicle are Oko-class
early warning satellites built by Lavochkin, but these are launched with
arguments of perigee around 312 degrees, and the new launch has an
argument of perigee of 280 degrees, a characteristic fingerprint of
Molniya communications satellites. The NASA OIG bulletin board is
reporting the satellite as a Molniya-1. It's possible that the satellite
is a failed Molniya-1, or that TASS messed up and gave out the wrong
name.

The 8K78M (Molniya-M) launch vehicle placed Kosmos-2361 and the Blok-L
fourth stage in low 208 x 384 km parking orbit from Plesetsk. The Blok-L
burn then delivered the payload to a 12-hour, 419 x 40708 km x 62.8 deg
elliptical orbit.


* Orbital Sciences launches STEX 

An Orbital Science ARPA Taurus rocket placed the STEX (Space Technology
EXperiments) satellite in orbit on Oct 3. The STEX satellite was built
by Lockheed Martin Astronautics (Denver) for the National Reconnaissance
Office. STEX's main experiments are provided by the Naval Research Lab,
including Hall Effect electric thrusters derived from Russian technology
and a 6 kilometer tether experiment, a follow-on to the earlier TIPS
satellite. STEX also carries experimental solar arrays and batteries.
STEX entered a 665 km orbit with an inclination of 85 degrees. It
has also been designated USA 140.

The ATEX advanced tether experiment consists of two end masses connected
with a 6 km polyethelyne tether. The upper end mass will be deployed
with the lower end mass remaining attached to STEX, for a series of
dynamics experiments. Later, the lower end mass will separate from
STEX and the ATEX end masses will form a free-flying pair as a distinct
satellite.

The ARPA Taurus rocket uses a TU-904 solid motor as its first stage; the
stage is the first stage of the Peacekeeper ICBM. The regular Taurus
uses a commercial variant of the stage, the Castor 120. The second and
third stages are Alliant  Orion 50 solid motors, like the first and
second stages of Orbital's winged Pegasus launch vehicle. The fourth
stage is an Orion 38, the same as the Pegasus third stage. This was the
third Taurus launch, and like the others was carried out from complex
576-East at Vandenberg Air Force Base.

  Taurus launches:

  1  ARPA Taurus  1994 Mar 13  STEP M0
  2  Taurus       1998 Feb 10  GFO/Orbcomm
  3  ARPA Taurus  1998 Oct  3  STEX/ATEX


* Ariane launches Eutelsat W2 and Sirius 3

On Oct 5 Ariane mission V111 launched two European comsats.
V111 used the Ariane 44LP version with two liquid and two solid
strapons. 

Eutelsat W2 is an Alcatel Spacebus 3000B2, with 32 Ku-band transponders.
It will be stationed at 16E, replacing Eutelsat II F2. It is owned by
the European Telecommunications Satellite Organization (Eutelsat). W2
was originally intended for launch on Ariane 5, but after the loss of W1
in a ground accident Eutelsat didn't want to risk flying W2 on a test
mission.

Sirius 3 is a small comsat for NSAB, the Swedish `Nordiska Satellite'
consortium. NSAB aren't ready to use Sirius 3 yet, so they are leasing
it to Eutelsat's main rival, SES-Astra, for a year. It will be stationed
at 28E for Astra services and then moved to 5E to provide services
to Sweden. The Hughes HS-376HP satellite has 15 Ku-band transponders.
It carries a Thiokol Star 30 solid apogee motor.

Shuttle and Mir
---------------

STS-95 is due to be launched on Oct 29. Meanwhile, Endeavour
has been moved to the VAB in preparation for STS-88.


STS-95 crew are:
 Curtis L. Brown, Jr., LtCol USAF, NASA,  Commander
 Steven W. Lindsey, LtCol USAF, NASA, Pilot,
 Stephen K. Robinson, Ph.D, NASA, Mission Specialist 1
 Scott E. Parazynski, MD, NASA, Mission Specialist 2
 Pedro F. Duque, ESA, Mission Specialist 3
 Chiaki Naito Mukai, MD, NASDA, Payload Specialist 1
 John H. Glenn, Jr., Col. USAF (Ret.), U.S. Senate (D-Oh.), Payload Specialist 2

Brown has flown on four missions (STS-47, 66, 77 and 85); 
Parazynski on two (STS-66 and 86), and Lindsey, Robinson Mukai and Glenn
each have made one flight.

Editorial
---------

I've added a new `work in progress' web page giving details of the
French national space program, including previously unpublished
information on the French sounding rocket program courtesy of
CNES/Toulouse. Comments and corrections, as always, welcome.

Errata
-------

In the description of the Hot Bird 5 launch, it has been pointed out to
me that the Centaur post-separation depletion (letting the remaining
fuel out to lower the chance of an explosion which would cause space
debris ) does not involve ignition of the engines, just a venting of the
tanks. The parking orbit perigee was 150 km.

Thanks to Mark Kinnersley for spotting another typo in my
launch sites list: Plesetsk is at 62.7 deg North, not 65 deg N.


Recent Launches

* UHF F/O F-9

Atlas flight AC-130 placed the UHF F/O F9 satellite in orbit on Oct 20
using a Lockheed Martin Astronautics (Denver) Atlas IIA with a 14-ft
fairing. It took off  from Cape Canaveral's Space Launch Complex 36A.
The Atlas IIA first stage main (sustainer) engine is the Boeing
Rocketdyne RS-56SA, based on the RS-27 used in Delta. Wrapped around the
main engine section is a booster section with a similar RS-56BA engine
with two thrust chambers. The combination of the sustainer and booster
engines is called the MA-5A engine system. The booster engine cutoff
(BECO) was at T+2:45 (i.e. 2min 45s after launch), followed 3s later by
separation of the heavy booster package with its two engine nozzles. The
sustainer engine cutoff (SECO) was at T+4:35. Although the Atlas IIA
stage is much stretched compared to the original missile, this
`stage-and-a-half' design is  largely unchanged since the (Convair/San
Diego) Atlas B flights in 1958 (the booster section on the experimental
Atlas A series of 1957 wasn't designed to separate). It still uses the
trademark pressurized tank, with a lightweight thin wall which must be
kept under pressure to stop the whole stage collapsing. The new Atlas
III now under design will lose the booster section in favor of a single
engine, and the EELV Atlas will have a conventional rigid wall design.

After separation of the Atlas stage at T+4:37, the Centaur II second
stage takes over. Centaur is a liquid hydrogen fuelled stage using two
Pratt and Whitney RL10A-4-1 engines. At T+9:53 the Centaur shut down
putting the vehicle in a 168 x 1090 km x 28.9 deg elliptical parking
orbit. After coasting around the orbit, Centaur reignited at T+22:23 for
about one minute until its fuel was almost depleted. and then at T+27:03
separated from the payload.  The payload was delivered to an orbit of
approximately 286 x 25866 km x 27.0 deg, very close to that expected,
with an apogee 10000 km below geostationary. The remaining altitude is
to be made up by the Marquardt R-4D bipropellant liquid apogee motor on
the satellite payload.

The payload is UHF F/O F9, an HS-601 satellite built by
Hughes/El Segundo, and is a  Block III UHF Follow-On comsat for the US
Naval Space Command. Earlier UHF F/O satellites were launched by Atlas
II and Atlas I, which have now been retired. The satellite carries UHF
and EHF transponders for naval communications, and a Ka-band Global
Broadcast Service video relay package. Launch mass is 3200 kg, dropping
to around 1550 kg once geostationary orbit is reached. Dry mass of the
satellite is probably around 1200-1300 kg, but I haven't seen a figure
on this. UHF F/O F9 will be placed over the Atlantic Ocean.


* Fuyo-1

The Japanese Fuyo-1 (ERS-1) satellite failed on Oct 12 after six years
of operation.

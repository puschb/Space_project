Shuttle and Mir
---------------

STS-95 is due to be launched on Oct 29. Meanwhile, Endeavour has been
moved to pad 39A in preparation for STS-88 with a Space Station module
payload. At Mir, the crew are awaiting the launch of the next Progress
cargo ferry.

Oops! John Glenn is Col. USMC (Ret.), not USAF of course. Apologies to
the hundreds of Marines and their friends who emailed to remind me of
this.

*Ariane 5 - fully successful flight

The third Ariane 5 test vehicle was launched on Oct 21 from the Ensemble
de Lancement Ariane No. 3 (ELA 3) at the Centre Spatial Guyanais,
Kourou. The Ariane 5, Europe's largest ever rocket, consists of two EAP
solid boosters, the EPC core stage powered by the LOX/LH2 Vulcain
engine, and the EPS (L9) upper stage with storable propellants.

Ariane 503 carries the ARD and Maqsat-3 payloads. Maqsat-3, built by
Kayser-Threde, is a dynamic model of Eutelsat W2, the payload originally
scheduled for the Ariane 503 mission. Mass is 2730 kg. Size is 2.0m
diameter, 2.5m long. The satellite is not instrumented except for a few
shock transducers and strain gauges to monitor the launcher environment.
Maqsat-3 will remain attached to the EPS stage in orbit. It is launched
inside the Speltra adapter.

The ARD (Atmospheric Reentry Demonstrator) spacecraft, built by
Aerospatiale for ESA, will make a suborbital flight. It is launched
upsidedown on top of the Speltra and is jettisoned before the EPS upper
stage ignites. The ARD shell is an 80 percent scale model of the Apollo
Command Module. ARD carries GPS recievers, a SARSAT beacon, and a TDRS
relay system. It features an experimental heat shield 2.8m in diameter,
a recovery system with three 23-m parachutes, and 7 of DASA's 400N
hydrazine thruster systems for attitude control.

Launch was at 1637:21 UTC. At T+2:23, the EAP boosters separated at 72
km altitude. The nose fairing separated at T+3:13. The EPC engine cutoff
at T+9:53 and EPC separated from the EPS. At T+12:02, the ARD separated
from the EPS/Speltra/Maqsat-3. ARD and the EPC stage entered a 1 x 830
km orbit. This doesn't count as truly in orbit, since the low perigee
ensures reentry on the first revolution. ARD reached apogee of 830 km at
T+43:21 as it arced around the world to a landing at 153.35W, 3.69N in
the Pacific at T+1h43min (Thanks to Stefan Barensky for the position).

At T+12:43 the Speltra adapter cover separated revealing Maqsat-3. At
T+15:14 the EPS stage Aestus engine ignited; it burned until T+31:00. At
this point on a normal mission the satellite would separate from the
EPS, but to avoid extra space debris Maqsat did not do this. The
EPS/Maqsat-3 satellite is in a 1027 x 35863 km x 7.0 deg geostationary
transfer orbit.

Ariane 5 is now qualified for operational use. Meanwhile, an Ariane
4 is due for launch on Oct 28 on mission V113.

* Orbital's Pegasus launches SCD-2

Brasil's SCD-2 satellite was launched on Oct 23 by a Pegasus, mission
P-33. This flight used the old `standard' Pegasus in its L-1011
configuration, not the Pegasus XL which has been used for all recent
missions. Orbital's L-1011 Stargazer aircraft took off from the Cape
Canaveral Air Station's Skid Strip (Runway 02/20, 28.2N 80.6W) at 2305
UTC on Oct 22 and flew to the drop zone near Cape Canaveral (in the
Mayport, Florida, Warning Area) at 29.0N 78.3W.  This is the first
Pegasus launch staged from Cape Canaveral Air Station; the SCD-1 launch
in 1993 took off from the Shuttle Landing Facility (RW15/33) at the NASA
Kennedy Space Center next door and probably (can anyone confirm?) used
the same drop location.

The three stage Pegasus ignited 5 seconds after drop. The first  stage
carried a NASA experiment attached to its right wing, to study
hypersonic boundary layer separation. The third stage reached an orbit 
of 743 x 768 km x 25.0 deg with the SCD-2 satellite. This orbit is very
close to the planned one, which will be a relief for Orbital after
difficulties on the last mission, when a second stage problem led to a
low initial orbit that could only be corrected because of the presence
of a Primex hydrazine fourth stage not carried on the current mission.
The next Pegasus mission, an XL, will launch NASA's SWAS astronomy
satellite.

The 115 kg Satelite de Coleta de Dados (Data Collection Satellite)
relays data from environmental monitoring stations. It is owned and
operated by INPE, the Instituto Nacional de Pesquisas Espacias de
Brasil.  As well as the SCD-1 and SCD-2 satellites, INPE launched
an SCD-2A test satellite in Nov 1997 on the first, unsuccessful
flight of INPE's own VLS launch vehicle.


* Deep Space 1 on its way

NASA carried out its first launch in the New Millenium Program (NMP) on
Oct 24. Deep Space 1 was placed in solar orbit by a Boeing Delta 7326
rocket. Delta 7326 is a new variant of Delta II which uses three solid
Alliant GEM-40 strapons, the standard Delta II   first and second
stages, and a Thiokol Star 37FM solid motor as the third stage. This
third stage is smaller than the usual Delta II Star 48 third stage, but
much more powerful than the earlier Star 37E model used as Delta's third
stage in the 1970s and 1980s.

Ejected from the Delta second stage was the SEDSAT microsatellite, built
by the Huntsville, Alabama chapter of SEDS (the Students for the
Exploration and Development of Space). SEDSAT has two amateur radio
transponders and an earth imaging camera.

Delta entered a 185 km parking orbit, then fired again to enter a 174 x
2744 km x 28.5 deg orbit. The third stage separated and accelerated to
solar orbit with DS1, while the second stage burned again to a planned
556 x 1042 km x 31.5 deg orbit with SEDSAT. DS1's orbit is around
1.0 x 1.3 AU with an inclination to the ecliptic around zero,
but I haven't been able to find solar orbital elements or state vectors
to give an accurate orbit. (1 AU = mean Earth orbit radius = 149.6
million km).

The 475 kg Deep Space 1 probe was built by Spectrum Astro for JPL using
the SA-200HP bus. Its mission is to test new technology for  future
probes, and the main experiment is a xenon ion propulsion drive. DS1
will fly past the high inclination Mars-crossing minor planet 1992 KD,
which is about 2 to 5 km in diameter. 1992 KD's orbit  comes to within
1.33 AU of the Sun, just within the perihelion of Mars' orbit (1.38 AU).
 Although JPL is describing 1992 KD as a Near Earth Object (NEO) of the
subclass called Amor asteroids, the IAU Minor Planet Center's definition
of an Amor requires a perihelion of 1.30 AU or less, so officially it
doesn't quite count as an NEO.

An additional 2001 flyby of Comet 19P/Borrelly is also an option. That
comet has a similar perihelion distance and inclination but its orbit is
much more elliptical, so the flyby speed would be much higher. By that
time DS1's engine will have moved it to an orbit of around 1.12 x 1.42 AU.

STS-95 was launched on Oct 29 with Sen. John Glenn and the first
Spanish astronaut Pedro Duque among the crew. The US Navy PANSAT
student satellite was deployed on Oct 30 into a 550 x 561 x 28.5 deg
orbit.

Meanwhile, Endeavour has been moved to pad 39A in preparation for STS-88
with a Space Station module payload.

Cargo ship Progress M-40 was launched from Baykonur on 1998 Oct 25.
It docked with the Mir orbital station to provide supplies on Oct 27.
It also carries the Znamya-2.5 solar illumination experiment.

I've been having mailer problems again, apologies if you
get more than one copy of this week's issue.

Visit to Kourou
---------------

I had the opportunity to be present for the launch of Ariane V113 on Oct
28, and in this special report describe my visit to the Centre Spatial
Guyanais (CSG) in Guyane francaise, S America. Pictures to accompany
this report are at

</A>

The small French town of Kourou is on the northern coast of the South 
American landmass, at the edge of the Amazonian forest.  From the air,
the approach to the region is over a dense mat of trees broken only by
the occasional river. The person next to me on the plane remarked that
the shape of the trees and their closeness to each other made it look
like a forest of broccoli. On a sandy beach covered with palm trees sits
a modern hotel where the penitentiary once stood (the notorious Devil's
Island is visible a few miles offshore).  We arrived the evening before
launch after an hour-long bus ride from Cayenne airport, in time for a
banquet of fresh seafood, baked plantain, and tropical juices as well as
more traditionally French dishes. I didn't get to see too much of the
town itself, but it has a population of around 17000 consisting mostly
of recent immigrants from the rest of South America, the Caribbean and
Europe, together with indigenous Amerinds and a village of the
descendants of Africans who escaped slavery and developed their own
communities. The next morning, a short bus ride to the west of town
takes us to the Centre Technique, and the Jupiter launch control room
where the representatives of the various agencies  briefed us. The
speakers used either French or English as they preferred, with
headphones provided for all of us to give simultaneous translation
for anyone who wasn't fluent in one or other language.

Launcher V113 was an Ariane 44L model, and carried the most massive
payload of any Ariane 4 to date, with 4.9 tonnes carried to orbit; it
was also the first time Arianespace has carried out three launches in a
single month.  The V113 vehicle used the lightest stages available at
the factory, and the fuel in the lower stages was kept at a lower
temperature than usual to increase its density and allow a few extra
kilograms to be loaded - they ended up with more than 230 tonnes in the
L220 first stage. These measures allowed the record payload, and
Arianespace president Jean-Marie Luton predicted that eventually we'll
see a 5-tonne payload on Ariane 4.

Two satellites were carried, Afristar and GE 5; both were delivered to
geostationary orbit.  The lower payload is the GE-5 satellite, with C
and Ku band transponders to augment the GE Americom system. GE Americom
contracted with  Daimler-Benz Aerospace/Dornier Satellitensystem
GmbH/Friedrichshafen to provide the satellite in orbit. They in turn
contracted Alcatel/Cannes to provide the Spacebus 2000 satellite,
originally built as a backup for Argentina's Nahuelsat.  This allowed
Dornier and Alcatel to deliver the satellite in a record  twelve months.
Dry mass of GE 5 is 769 kg; it carries 950 kg of propellant at launch.

The upper payload was the first WorldSpace satellite, Afristar. Afristar
will  broadcast digital radio over Africa and the Middle East. Small
handheld radios will be able to pick up the transmissions from its three
L-band beams; the satellite can carry from 24 to 96 radio channels
with on-board processing to allow variable bit rates from mono
to CD audio quality transmission. Broadcasters send their programs
up to the satellite with a small X-band ground station.
It will be followed next year by Asiastar and Ameristar. Afristar is a
Matra Marconi Space (Toulouse) Eurostar 2000+, using a Marquardt R-4D
apogee engine. Prime contractor for the combined satellite and comms
payload is Alcatel. Dry mass of Afristar is 1205 kg; it carries 1534 kg
of propellant at launch. The WorldSpace project is led by 
Ethiopian-born Noah Samara, whose ebullient
personality was very much in evidence at CSG during the V113 launch.
There was a strong feeling that Afristar was not just yet one more
`boring' comsat, but part of a crusade to empower the developing world
by providing improved access to information. Samara's mantra is that
`people are only as developed as the information they access.' Another
of the leading figures in WorldSpace, chief engineer Pierre Madon, was
feted for completing a notable career in aerospace which included a
leading role in the first French rocket program Diamant and the
Symphonie comsat of the 1970s, as well as a long career at Intelsat.

CSG is operated by the French space agency CNES. The Ariane launch
vehicle was developed by the European Space Agency, ESA, together with
CNES, and is operated by the Arianespace company. Travelling further
west from Jupiter on the old Route Nationale 1 coast  road, we reach the
CSG proper, with the entrance guarded by the French Foreign Legion.  The
launch pads are on the north side of the road, nearer the sea. We first
pass the small clearing which marks the sounding rocket launch area
("aire de lancement fusee-sondes"). Here in 1968 was the first launch
from CSG, a small Veronique rocket. The area has four launchers, three
still in use for small weather rockets and amateur launches. A little
further and we reach the now disused Diamant pad. Used between 1970 and
1975, CNES launched several small satellites from here using the Diamant
B and Diamant B P.4 vehicles. The other old pad was the Aire de
Lancement Europa, some distance to the west. A single orbital launch
attempt from here by the Europa vehicle failed in 1971. However, by 1979
the pad had been rebuilt to become ELA 1, the first Ensemble de
Lancement Ariane, marking the beginning of Europe's success in the
commercial space launch services business with Ariane launches from 1979
to 1989, when the ELA1 pad was retired. Only a water tower marks the
spot currently. Next to ELA1 is ELA2, which we didn't get too close to
as it was occupied by our fully fuelled V113 launch vehicle. In the
early afternoon, the enclosed gantry was rolled back from ELA2 to reveal
the Ariane rocket on the pad, and fuelling of the cryogenic third stage
began. We were able to observe the rocket from the roof of a nearby
building - the third stage was enclosed in insulation, and no venting
was visible. The pad is surprisingly close to the Ariane 4 assembly
building, containing the V114 launcher now being assembled, and the
nearby ESA and Arianespace offices. 

The remaining launch site is ELA3, which is spread over a large area
between ELA2 and the Diamant area. The rocket and payload are assembled
in two large buildings, BIL and BAF, and are then taken out to the pad on
a mobile launch platform (Table de Lancement) which travels on a small
railway. We saw the launch platform used for the Ariane 503 mission
being returned by rail to the BAF building, while a second platform was
under construction nearby. The BIL and BAF are to the south of the main
road while the pad is to the north.

The Ariane 5 pad itself, ZL3 (Zone de lancement) contains only the minimal
equipment for launch, to simplify reconstruction if there is a launch
accident. A simple umbilical tower is flanked by three large lightning
towers which dominate the site's appearance, reminiscent of the
N-1/Energiya pads at Baykonur.  The main pad has  a circular mount for
the central core and mounts for the solid boosters on each side,  above
large flame trenches filled with water (the water suppresses reflection
of sound energy from the launch which would otherwise increase the
vibration levels inside the payload fairing). The trenches are similar
to the ones I saw at Vandenberg's SLC-6 Shuttle pad.  A large water
tower and liquid hydrogen and helium storage facilities complete the
picture.

After our visits to the launch site were complete, and a brief trip back
to  Kourou, we set off again to the Jupiter control center where we
watched the final countdown from the auditorium surrounding the launch
control room proper. (We had the choice of going to the outdoor Toucan
viewing point closer to the pad, but I decided it would be geekier to
get as close to the launch controllers as I could). The launch
commentary, with the cultivated and reassuring tones of former BBC man
Martin Ransom lending a touch of class, punctuated the countdown as the
display screens showed live TV from the pad beside the clocks and status
displays, and the  controllers pored over their consoles in front of us.

At T-1 minute, the side doors of the auditorium were opened and we
rushed out on the terrace to watch. We scanned the dark horizon and
didn't know which direction to look, but then 'Allumage!' and a bright
light appeared  in the distance to our left. Slowly this new star rose
into the sky - initially it was pretty much pointlike. It arced over our
position and we began to see the trail of fire behind it. About half a
minute later, the sound began to reach us as a dull roar which grew to a
loud crackling sound. Separation of the strapon boosters was visible as
a dramatic flare, and we were able to follow the rocket through first
stage separation as it moved down the coast to our right. The
disappearance of the first stage plume as followed by a bright flash
like a firework as the separation occurred. Trooping back to our seats,
we heard the report of second stage separation and settled down to watch
the graphic of the long third stage burn. At T+20 min the Afristar
satellite finally separated and a huge cheer went up, followed two
minutes later by another cheer for GE 5. Afristar and GE 5 were placed
in a 200 x 35788 km x 6.5 deg orbit. The launch team put on T-shirts
celebrating the month's three launches (I thought the big boss Luton
looked a little uncomfortable in such informal attire), and after the
obligatory speeches (Walter Braun of GE Americom bravely and courteously
giving his in French) a long night of partying began. The following day,
most of the group went off to tour Devil's Island, but I stayed in
Kourou to interview space center old-timers and soak up some beach time
to brace myself for Friday's 4:30 am homeward wakeup call.

Thanks to Arianespace for making my trip possible, and to Marie-Vincente
Pasdeloup, Jean-Michel Desobeau, Yves Dejean, Martin Ransom, Pierre
Madon and others for their helpful information.

Recent Launches
---------------

* Ariane 503

The Ariane 503 mission described last week was the first
Ariane 5 launch carried out by Arianespace, and is numbered
V112 in their system. For the first two Ariane 5 flights,
CNES and ESA both owned the launch vehicle and carried out
the launch. On V112, Arianespace owned the vehicle but ESA and
CNES were the customers.

* Meteosat 1 apogee motor

The Meteosat 1 apogee motor has finally been cataloged by Space Command.
The motor has been assigned international designation 1977-108D and
catalog number 13907. Until around Oct 1, 13907 was assigned to a piece
of debris from a 1967 explosion, 1967-01AB. This debris object was in an
elliptical orbit of 292 x 17909 km x 24 deg on Sep 30, it's not clear
where it is in the catalog now. The practice of reassigning  previously
used catalog numbers is really confusing, and I do wish Space Command
wouldn't do it. It's not like they are going to run out of positive
integers, after all...

Meteosat 1 was launched on 1977 Nov 23 and ejected its apogee motor
after reaching geostationary orbit some days later. There's some
confusion as to what apogee motor was used - ESA bulletin 85 implies
an Aerojet solid motor, probably an SVM-5; other sources which
say it used an Italian SNIA/BPD solid motor derived from the one
developed for the Europa program are probably incorrect.

* Deep Space 1

Marc Rayman from the DS1 team reports that Deep Space 1 was injected
into a 0.99 x 1.32 AU x 0.4 deg solar orbit, with a mass of 486.3 kg
(including 81.5 kg of Xe and 31.1 kg of hydrazine). He corrects me that
DS1 was built by both JPL and Spectrum Astro, rather than 'by Spectrum
Astro for JPL'.

Shuttle and Station
------------------------

The International Space Station era has begun. The launch of the Zarya
module was successful on Nov 20 at 0640 UTC. Zarya is the first element
of the International Space Station. It was funded by the US and built by
Krunichev in Moscow, and will be controlled by RKA/Energiya in Korolev. 
Krunichev built it under a subcontract from Boeing for NASA, so I
imagine that formally NASA is the owner but RKA is the operator.
The Zarya derives its design from the TKS spaceship and the 77KS Mir
side modules. Zarya is the Funktional'no-Gruzovoy Blok (FGB), serial
77KM No 175-01. It includes a multiple docking adapter, a pressurised
cabin section, and a propulsion/instrument section with a rear docking
port. Zarya was launched by a three stage Proton-K (8K82K) rocket,
serial 395-01, from pad 81L at 5-GIK (the Baykonur cosmodrome). The
third stage and Zarya reached orbit 9 min after takeoff. Initial orbit
was 176 x 343 km x 51.6 deg. By Nov 25 it had maneuvered to a 383 x 396
km x 51.7 deg orbit, awaiting the launch of Shuttle mission STS-88 which
will dock the Unity node to it.

Meanwhile, Space Shuttle OV-105 Endeavour is on the launch pad ready for
mission STS-88 on Dec 3. Crew of STS-88 are: Commander - Col. Robert
Cabana, USMC, NASA chief astronaut Pilot - Maj. Frederick Sturckow,
USMC/NASA Mission Specialists: Col. Jerry Ross, USAF/NASA, Maj. Nancy
Currie, USA/NASA, Dr. James Newman, NASA, and Sergei Krikalyov, RKA. The
payload bay contains the following cargo:

Sill:     RMS arm No. 303
Bay 1-2:  Tunnel Adapter 002
Bay 3-4:  Orbiter Docking System/External Airlock  (Boeing/Palmdale)
Bay 7-13: Unity (Node 1)         (Boeing/Huntsville)
          PMA-1 docking adapter  (Boeing/Huntingdon Beach), 
          PMA-2 docking adapter  (Boeing/Huntingdon Beach)

Bay 2  Port: GABA adapter with SAC-A satellite
Bay 4  Port: Carrier with PFR spacewalk restraint
Bay 4  Stbd: Carrier with Cable Caddy for spacewalks
Bay 5? Stbd: Carrier with PFR spacewalk restraint
Bay 6  Port: GABA adapter with Mightysat
Bay 6? Stbd: Carrier with two TCS laser rendevous sensors
Bay 13 Port: GABA adapter with SEM-7 and G-093 canisters
Bay 13 Stbd: GABA adapter with IMAX Cargo Bay Camera

The PMA-1 and PMA-2 adapters are detachable from Unity, but launched
installed. Endeavour will unberth Unity from the bay using the RMS arm,
and dock PMA-2 to the Orbiter Docking System. After rendezvous, the
axial +Y port of Zarya will be attached to PMA-1. PMA-2 will be used as
ISS's main Shuttle docking port; it will be moved from Unity to the Lab
module when that is launched.

The SAC-A satellite is an Argentine payload which carries an
experimental remote sensing camera and a marine life science experiment
consisting of a GPS receiver which will track signals from a
GPS-equipped whale (yes, a whale). The 60 kg satellite was build by
INVAP of Bariloche for CONAE, the Argentine space agency. It will be
ejected from an HMDA canister in the payload bay.

Mightysat is a small satellite with a mass of about 70 kg, built by
Orbital Sciences/McLean.  It carries a suite of  technology experiments
for USAF Phillips Lab. Mightysat and SAC-A share a Hitchhiker avionics
box. SEM-7 is a canister with high school experiments; G-093 has a 
physics experiment for the U. of Michigan.

The ISS overview press kit shows a cargo bay view with the 'AMTEC/AWCS'
experiments where SEM-7/G-093 should be; in fact, AMTEC and AWCS are
technology experiments on the Mightysat payload, although it's not clear
if they are mounted on the subsatellite or remain attached to the
Shuttle. The new, "improved" (sic) STS press kits themselves have no
graphics of the payloads, so I'm not sure of the details of the EVA
equipment.


Mir
---

Padalka and Avdeev made a spacewalk from the  Kvant-2 airlock on the Mir
complex on Nov 10-11. Hatch open was Nov 10 1924 UTC and hatch closed
was Nov 11 0118 UTC according to C. van den Berg. They installed a
meteorite detector in  preparation for the Leonid shower, and
hand-launched the Spoutnik-41 amateur-radio minisatellite at around 1930
UTC (anyone have a better time?). Spoutnik-41 (Spoutnik is the French
spelling) is a scale model of the first satellite, PS-1, launched 41
years ago. It carries a small transmitter, and is also designated RS-18.
A similar model was launched last year. Sponsors of the satellite are
Aero Club de France, AMSAT-France, and the Astronautical Federation of
Russia.

On that occasion, two flight models were carried to Mir but only one was
launched. The second Spoutnik-40 flight model is still aboard Mir. The
recent Progress flight carried up yet a third satellite with an improved
electronics module. (There was earlier some confusion about whether the
RS-18 satellite was a new satellite or was the one stored on Mir since
last year; Bernard Pidoux confirms Spoutnik-41 is an entirely new
satellite, and the plan to just swap out the electronics module on the
other one was abandoned). The second Spoutnik-40 may still be deployed
next year. Four other objects from the EVA are being tracked by Space
Command.

STS-93/AXAF
-----------

The solid rocket boosters for mission STS-93 have been stacked
on mobile launch plaform MLP-1 in the VAB. The AXAF telescope
payload is still in California; launch of STS-93 is now expected
in March.

Recent Launches
---------------

The BONUM-1 satellite was successfully launched by a Boeing Delta 2 on
Nov 22. BONUM-1 is a Hughes HS-376HP communications satellite with a
Thiokol Star 30 solid apogee motor. The satellite will provide domestic
Russian communications for Media Most, a Moscow-based television and
media conglomerate, broadcasting 50 channels to western Russia from a
position at 36 deg E. Mass is 1426 kg at launch, around 630 kg dry.  The
HS-376HP is small by today's standards and carries just 8 Ku-band
transponders. The Delta 7925-9.5 launch vehicle  entered a 157 x 189 km
x 29.2 deg parking orbit ten minutes after launch. Two further burns of
the second stage raised the orbit to 159 x 1304 km and then 1228 x 1683
km x 26.7 deg. The Thiokol Star 48B solid third stage then boosted
BONUM-1 to a 1285 x 36703 km x 19.5 deg geostationary transfer orbit
while the second stage made a final depletion burn to lower its orbit to
274 x 1552 km x 25.6 deg, making sure it will reenter quickly.

Deep Space 1, in solar orbit, successfully started its ion drive on Nov
24. An initial attempt failed after four minutes on Nov 10. This is the
first time ion propulsion has been used as the primary propulsion
on a spacecraft.

Below is a list of spacecraft thought to have tested electric propulsion
systems. I haven't done a proper study of this subject, so this list is
incomplete and may have errors - perhaps someone can come up with a
better one. It is intended to include ion thrusters, pulsed plasma
thrusters and Hall effect thrusters, but exclude  the lower efficiency
arcjets. The Russians report 15 flights of stationary Hall plasma
thrusters since 1971. The XIPS is an 8-cm ion thruster; NSTAR is a 30-cm
one. All systems prior to this year were used for experiments only, or
for fine orbit control and maintenance. What's new is that DS1 and STEX
will actually use their systems for major orbit changes.

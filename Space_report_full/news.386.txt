Jonathan's Space Report: 10th anniversary year

Shuttle and Station
------------------------

The next Shuttle launch is STS-93, which will deploy the Chandra X-ray
Observatory. Launch of Chandra has again been delayed, since faulty
circuit boards found on the Kompsat satellite are also used in Chandra's
command and telemetry unit. They'll have to replace at least some of the
boards. The delay could be either one month or several  months depending
on how many units are affected; we'll know in a week or so.

Columbia will be transferred to the Vehicle Assembly Building in early
February; Chandra flies from TRW's Redondo Beach plant in California to
Florida at the beginning of February, with the replacement boards
to be installed at the Cape.

The Mir space station remains in orbit with Gennady Padalka and
Sergey Avdeev aboard. The transport ship Soyuz TM-28 and cargo
ship Progress M-40 are docked to the station. The International
Space Station remains dormant in orbit awaiting the STS-96 mission
sometime this summer.

Recent Launches
---------------

The only orbital launch so far this month has been the Mars Polar
Lander. The Cassini probe to Saturn entered safemode Jan 11 due to an
attitude determination problem, but returned safely to checking out its
instruments on Jan 16. Meanwhile, NEAR successfully made an engine burn
to put it back on course for rendezvous with Eros in 2000. Mars Polar
Lander has also made its first course correction in solar orbit.

The NRO's ATeX advanced tether experiment reportedly failed on Jan 16.
The ATeX lower end mass was meant to remain attached to the STEX parent
spacecraft, but with only 21m of tether deployed, it appears the tether
was so far off vertical that automatic safety systems jettisoned the
base to protect the remainder of the STEX satellite. Thus,the upper and
lower ATeX endmasses are in orbit as one object connected by a 21m
tether, and designated USA 141 (1998-55C). The main STEX satellite is in
orbit as a separate object, 1998-55A.

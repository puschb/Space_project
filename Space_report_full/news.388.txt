Shuttle and Station
------------------------

The Chandra observatory was flown from California to KSC on Feb 4. We're
hoping for a launch on Jul 9.

The Mir space station remains in orbit with Gennady Padalka and Sergey
Avdeev aboard. Progress M-40 undocked on Feb 4 at 0959 UTC, but the
attempt to deploy the Znamya-2.5 reflector ran into trouble when it 
caught on an antenna. Two attempts failed to deploy the antenna, and the
experiment was abandoned. Progress M-40 fired its engines for the
deorbit burn at 1016 UTC on Feb 5 and reentered over the Pacific.

At 1123 UTC on Feb 8, Padalka and Avdeev undocked from Mir's -X port in
Soyuz TM-28, and redocked at the +X Kvant port at 1139 UTC, freeing up
the front port for the planned Soyuz TM-29 docking.


Recent Launches
---------------

The Stardust probe was launched from Cape Canaveral on Feb 7 at 2104
UTC. Launch vehicle was a Boeing Delta 7426. Four GEM-40 solid boosters
separated one minute after launch. First stage separation at 2108 UTC
was followed by the second stage's first burn, placing the stack in a
185 x 185 km x 28 deg parking orbit at 2114 UTC. The second stage
restarted at 2125 to change the orbit to approximately 178 x 7184 km x
28.5 deg (planned). This was followed by third stage burn at 2129 UTC
and spacecraft separation at 2131 UTC. After its depletion burn, the
Delta 266 second stage was left in a  294 x 6818 km x 22.5 deg orbit.
The Star 37FM third stage entered solar orbit and separated from the
Stardust probe. Stardust's orbit has a 2 year period. This is the second
Delta launch using the Star 37FM lightweight third stage; the first was
Deep Space 1.

Stardust was built by Lockheed Martin Astronautics/Denver. The fourth
mission in the Discovery program,  Stardust will fly 100 km from comet
81P/Wild-2 in  Jan 2004 and recover cometary material using an aerogel
substance. The encounter will take place 1.9 AU from the Sun. Stardust
will also collect some material from the interplanetary medium. A return
capsule would land on a lake bed in Utah in Jan 2006. Stardust uses
Denver's Space Probe bus with a return vehicle, the Sample Reentry
Capsule (SRC). The SRC is passive, and the Stardust bus orients it for
entry before separating. The navigation    camera is a Voyager spare.
Probe mass is 340 kg full.

The Discovery missions are:
   NEAR               En route to rendezvous with (433) Eros
   Mars Pathfinder    Landed near Ares Vallis, Mars
   Lunar Prospector   In low lunar polar orbit
   Stardust           En route to 81P/Wild-2
   Genesis            Launch to L1 due 2001
   Contour            Launch 2002 to flyby several comets
Five more missions are currently under consideration for selection.

The first Soyuz-U/Ikar launch vehicle placed four Globalstar satellites
in orbit on Feb 9, with launch at 0354 UTC. The vehicle was a standard
Soyuz-U (11A511U) with an extra Ikar payload stage derived from the
Yantar' reconnaissance satellite's propulsion module. The Soyuz-U third
stage, Blok-I, ignitied at 4min 43s and separated at 8 min 48s into
flight in a 236 x 884 km x 52.0 deg  transfer orbit. The Ikar stage,
with a Melnikov 17D61 UDMH/N2O4 engine, burned at second apogee, at 0623
UTC, and dispensed the Globalstar satellite on top of the dispenser,
FM36, into 915 x 947 km x 52.0 deg orbit at 0727 UTC. The three
remaining satellites (FM 23,38,40) mounted around the side of the
dispenser were released at the same time, according to a Globalstar
source, (the Starsem web page describes a plan for a later deployment of
the three at 0904 UTC, which is presumably out of date) into a 903 x 946
km x 52.0 deg orbit. The Ikar stage has not yet been cataloged. The
Globalstar satellites will provide mobile communications at L-band. The
satellites were built by Loral and Alenia. This was the first launch
carried out by the Starsem organization, a joint venture including
Aerospatiale and TsSKB-Progress (the launch vehicle manufacturer). The
dispenser was built by Aerospatiale/Aquitaine (Bordeaux). 

 Thanks to Igor Lissov for confirmation of launch pads for
recent Russian flights.

Mars Global Surveyor made its aerobraking exit burn at 0811 UTC on Feb
4, raising periapsis out of the Martian atmosphere. It will enter its
final mapping orbit on Feb 18. Orbit is currently 384 x 406 km x 93.0
deg.

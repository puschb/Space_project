Human spaceflight
-------------------

The EO-27 crew of Afanas'ev, Avdeev and Haignere are aboard the Mir
complex. Discovery is being prepared for the STS-96 mission to
the International Space Station.

Valeriy Illarionov died of cancer in Zvezdniy Gorodok on Mar 10.  A
former Soviet Air Force cosmonaut and support member for the
Apollo-Soyuz program, Illarionov never flew in space.

STS-103 is now definitely planned for October with the HST repair
mission. After that the Shuttle, Mir and ISS launch schedule remains
uncertain.

Recent Launches
---------------

Four Globalstar satellites were launched by Soyuz-Ikar on Mar 15. The
Soyuz-U's Blok-I third stage delivered the Ikar upper stage with
Globalstar dispenser to a 235 x 899 km x 52.0 deg transfer orbit. The
Ikar stage circularization burn placed the four satellites in a 897 x
950 km x 52.0 deg  parking orbit. Satellite M022 was separated first
from the top of the dispenser, followed by ejection of the other three
satellites from the sides. Satellite separation was at 0637 UTC
following launch at 0306 UTC. For a while the Ikar was in a similar
orbit to the Globalstars, but it made a depletion deorbit burn on Mar 16
and reentered. On the first Soyuz/Ikar launch on Feb 9, the Ikar deorbit
burn came soon after deployment and the Ikar was never cataloged by
Space Command. The Soyuz-U/Ikar is build by TsSKB-Progress of Samara
and marketed by the French Starsem company. The Globalstar satellites
are L-band low orbit mobile telephone comsats built by Loral and Alenia.

The WIRE infrared astronomy satellite lost all of its hydrogen cryogen
by Mar 8, so, sadly, the mission is a total loss. The spacecraft may be
used for engineering tests.

In Taiwanese documents written in Chinese, the ROCSAT (Republic Of China
Satellite) satellite, launched on Jan 27, is written using  the Chinese
name for China (often translated 'Middle Kingdom'). In the Wade-Giles
transliteration used in Taiwan this word is Chunghua (or Chunghwa), as
opposed to the mainland Pinyin transliteration in which the same word
would be Zhongguo. Since I prefer to use the name in the owner's
language, I've amended the listing accordingly.

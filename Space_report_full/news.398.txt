Obituary
--------

Russian space historian Maxim Tarasenko (1962-1999) was killed in an
automobile accident last week. Maxim was author of the ground-breaking
book 'Military Aspects of Soviet Cosmonautics' and a regular contributor
to Novosti Kosmonavtiki magazine. He was one of the first Russian
historians to present a detailed view of the newly declassified Soviet
space program. Maxim will be missed by all of us in the space history
community.

Human spaceflight
-------------------

Viktor Afanas'ev, Sergey Avdeev and Jean-Pierre Haignere remain on board
the Mir complex. The Soyuz TM-29 transport craft and the Progress M-41
cargo ship are docked to the complex.

Launch of STS-96 has been delayed to around May 27. Due to hail damage
they've rolled the stack back to the VAB to make repairs to the External
Tank. The STS-93 stack was rolled out of high bay 1 to make room for STS-96.
Launch of STS-93 is no earlier than Jul 22.

Recent Launches
---------------

China launched the FY-1C (Feng Yun) weather satellite from Taiyuan in
Shanxi on May 10 on the first Chang Zheng 4B launch vehicle. The CZ-4B
(Long March 4B) is an enhanced version of the CZ-4. FY-1C is in an 849 x
868 x 98.7 deg sun-synchronous orbit.

Previous FY launches:
  FY-1    1988 Sep 6   CZ-4    Taiyuan
  FY-1B   1990 Sep 3   CZ-4    Taiyuan
  FY-2    1997 Jun 10  CZ-3    Xichang

The Shi Jian 5 research satellite was also carried as a secondary
payload to study the radiation belts. FY-1 and SJ-5 are built by the
Shanghai Inst. for Satellite Engineering, and the CZ-4 launch vehicle is
developed by the Shanghai Bureau of Astronautics. The CZ-4B is a three
stage vehicle, with all of the stages using LOX/UDMH engines. The CZ-4A
had a four YF-20B engines in the first stage,  a YF-22B/YF-23B powered
second stage, and two YF-40 engines in the third stage. I'm not sure
what modifications were made to the CZ-4B stages, but I gather the
changes are modest.

Navstar spacecraft GPS SVN 50 (GPS-IIR production number SV-10),
awaiting launch by Delta nII from Cape Canaveral, was damaged in a
thunderstorm on May 8. Rain leaked into the clean-room on SLC-17A's
mobile launch tower. Launch will be delayed while they figure
out whether the satellite has been damaged.

I discussed Centaur stages in my last report; several sources inform me
that the Shuttle Centaur G' stages SC-1 and SC-2 are distinct from the
Titan Centaur flight articles. SC-3, the first Centaur G stage, was also
under early construction for the Magellan Venus probe but the tank was
not completed at the time Shuttle-Centaur was cancelled.
I've updated my launch list of Centaurs at
 http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~jcm/space/misc/centaur.html
with a lot of new details.
Here's an overview of Centaur types:
 3.05-meter diameter standard Centaurs (9.1m):
  Centaur A     F-1 test flight, RL-10A-1 engines
  Centaur B     AC-2 test flight, first orbital model, RL-10A-3 engine
  Centaur C     AC-3 to AC-5 test flights, RL-10A-3 engine
  Centaur D     Single burn version with RL-10A-3-1, AC-6/7/10/11
  Centaur D     Operational version 1965-1967, with RL-10A-3-3 engine
  Centaur D-1A  Improved version 1967-1972 (RL-10A-3-3 engines)
  Centaur D-1AR Improved version 1973-1989 (later models with RL-10A-3-3A)
  Centaur D-1T  Titan 3E version 1974-1977
  Centaur I     Same as D-1AR  1990-1997

 3.05-meter diameter stretched Centaur (10m long)
  Centaur II    Stretched version for Atlas II  (RL-10A-3-3A)
  Centaur IIA   Stretched version for Atlas IIA/IIAS (RL-10A-4/RL-10A-4-1)
  Centaur (SEC) Single Engine Centaur for Atlas IIIA (planned, RL-10A-4-1)

 3.05-meter diameter stretched Centaur (11.7m long - 12.7 with nozzle ext).
 Single and dual engine versions (Atlas IIIB and V)
  Centaur III DEC:          2 x RL10A-4-2 engines
  Centaur III SEC:          1 x RL10A-4-2, 

 4.32-meter diameter fat Centaurs:
  Centaur G     Shuttle version, cancelled (RL-10A-3-3A engines)
  Centaur G'    Stretched Shuttle version, cancelled
  Centaur (Titan 4)  Same as G'?     1994+ (RL-10A-3-3A engines)
  Centaur (TC-23)    Derated RL-10A-4-1A engines


United Nations Registry
-----------------------

I've updated my edited version of the United Nations Registry
of Space Objects, at 
 http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~jcm/space/un/un.html 
and the list of satellites which have not been registered, at
 http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~jcm/space/un/un_paper1.html 
Member states of the UN are required to register space objects owned by
them; the accuracy and completeness of the information provided is
pretty spotty. The United States remains the state with the most errors
and omissions in its submissions; Mexico and Brazil are grossly overdue
in updating their registrations. The US should be registering INTELSAT's
satellites, but does not; the United Kingdom should be registering
INMARSAT's satellites, but does not.  Since 1991, when the US last
failed to register one of its classified satellites, there is no
evidence of any state deliberately failing to register a satellite to
avoid detection - the omissions seem to be due to sloppiness.
I've also updated the launch logs  and the geostationary
object log on my web site.

Feb 21, 1989  (No. 4)

As reported last week, the first US launch of the year went off
perfectly.  The Navstar 2-1 satellite has now circularised its orbit at
20000 km altitude.  The next Navstar /Delta 2 launch is set for April. 

The Soviet Union launched a robot cargo freighter on 10 Feb to 
deliver food, air, fuel and experiments to the Mir space station.
The Progress-40 spacecraft linked up with Mir on 12 Feb, and
will remain attached to the station for about a month. It will be
followed by Progress-41 in March, and then a month of major activity
in April when the station will be enlarged by the addition of a new
module, and a new crew will take over.

Also on Feb 10, the Kosmos-2000 satellite was launched into polar 
orbit. The second mission of the year to be operated by the Soviet
Priroda ("Nature") Center, it will be used to make maps of Antarctica.

The space shuttle Discovery is still on target for a mid-March
launch at Kennedy Space Center.


Other events:

6 satellites (Kosmos-1994 to 1999) were launched on a single Tsiklon
("Cyclone") booster on Feb 10, making a total of 8 satellites launched
that day. The small satellites are believed to be used for either
geodetic or communications purposes by the Soviet Navy.

The Kosmos-1990 satellite completed its mission to survey Armenia
and landed in the USSR after 30 days in space.

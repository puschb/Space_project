Jonathan's Space Report

May 30 1990 (no.40)
----------------------------------------------------

Launch of STS-35/Columbia was scrubbed yesterday during fuelling due to
hydrogen leaks near the orbiter/ET attach point.  A new launch date has
not been set.  The launch of the ROSAT x-ray astronomy satellite is
scheduled for Jun 1. 

The Hubble Space Telescope is in its Orbital Verification phase.  The
first WF/PC image gave 0.2 arcsec images; controllers are working to
improve the focus and stability of the telescope, check out the
instrument electronics, and resolve problems with acquiring guide stats. 
Command errors sent the HST into safemode on May 27, but operations were
resumed the next evening. 

Anatoli Solov'yov (Komandir) and Aleksandr Balandin (Bortinzhener)
continue in orbit aboard the Mir complex.  The Soyuz TM-9 transport is
currently at the station.  Progress-42 was due to undock a few days ago. 
Launch of the Kristall module is due for May 31.  Kristall will carry an
EVA ladder to assist the planned spacewalk repair of loose insulation
blankets on the Soyuz TM-9 SA (descent module). 
Solov'yov and Balandin have been in space for 107 days. 

Kosmos-2078 was launched on May 15 by Soyuz from Baykonur; it is
a photographic mapping survey satellite.

Kosmos-2079, Kosmos-2080, and Kosmos-2081 are GLONASS navigation
satellites, the Soviet copy of Navstar.  They were launched on May 19 by
a single Proton vehicle into a 20,000 km orbit. 

Kosmos-2082, launched on May 22, is a large signals intelligence satellite
in an 800-km orbit. This was the first use of the new Zenit launch vehicle
since late 1988; no reason has been given for the hiatus in Zenit launches.

Topic of the week: Zenit
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are two variants of the Zenit vehicle; a one-stage version used as
a strapon for the Energiya launch vehicle, and a two-stage version used
as a satellite launch vehicle. A three-stage variant is due to fly in 1993.
The Zenit 2 has carried two types of payload into orbit: a large signals
intelligence satellite which I call Ferret E, and a series of heavy low 
orbit payloads which I believe were related to Buran systems development.
The first two Ferret E craft were launched by 4-stage Proton before 
Zenit was operational. All Zenit launches have been successful with the
exception of Kosmos-1714, when the second stage failed to restart and
the payload was left in an elliptical transfer orbit. Zenit has been offered
for commercial use, and may be launched from Australia's planned Cape York 
spaceport.

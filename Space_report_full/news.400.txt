Human spaceflight
-------------------

The first Shuttle mission of the year, STS-96, took off on May 27 at
1049 UTC. After solid rocket booster separation at 1051 UTC, main engine
cutoff at 1057 UTC, and separation of external tank ET-100, Discovery
was in a 74 x 320 km x 51.6 deg transfer orbit. After the OMS-2 burn at
1132 UTC, the orbit was 324 x 341 km x 51.6 deg. Discovery docked with
the International Space Station's PMA-2 docking port at 0424 UTC on May
29. ISS was in a 379 x 385 km x 51.6 deg orbit. In its current
configuration, it consists of the PMA-2 docking port, NASA's Unity node,
the NASA-owned, Russian-built Zarya module, and the PMA-1 docking unit
connecting Unity and Zarya.

On May 30 at 0256 UTC Tammy Jernigan and Dan Barry entered the payload
bay of Discovery from the tunnel adapter hatch, and made a 7hr 55min
spacewalk, transferring equipment to the exterior of the station. On May
31 at 0115 UTC the hatch to Unity was opened and the crew began several
days of cargo transfers to the station. Battery units and communications
equipment were replaced and sound insulation was added to Zarya.
Discovery undocked from ISS at 2239 UTC on Jun 3 into a 385 x 399 km x
51.6 deg orbit, leaving the station without a crew aboard. At 0721 UTC
on Jun 5 the Starshine satellite was ejected into a 379 x 396 km x 51.6
deg orbit from a canister at the rear of Discovery's payload bay.  The
small Starshine satellite, built by NRL, will be observed by students as
part of an educational exercise. The payload bay doors were closed at
around 0215 UTC on Jun 6 and the deorbit burn was at 0454 UTC. Discovery
landed on runway 15 at Kennedy Space Center at 0602 UTC.

It looks like the Mir space station might be abandoned in August, after
the current crew completes its mission. Energiya hasn't managed to find
funding to continue the program, although it wouldn't astonish me if the
decision to shut Mir down was reversed yet again. Mir was launched in
February 1986. If the Mir crew return without replacement before
permanent occupation of ISS begins next year, there will be no humans in
space for the first time since September 1989.


STS-93/Chandra
---------------

The Chandra spacecraft was connected to the IUS-27 upper stage on Jun 3,
in the Vertical Processing Facility at Kennedy Space Center. On the same
day, Columbia was towed from the Orbiter Processing Facility to the
Vehicle Assembly Building and then connected to its external tank and
solid rocket boosters to complete the STS-93 stack. The stack will be
rolled out to the launch pad on Jun 7 and prepared for a launch in late
July (the exact date is still being argued about).

Recent Launches
---------------

The NRO satellite launched on May 22 was placed in an initial 200 x 293
km x 63.4 deg orbit. It probably contains its own propulsion system to
raise the orbit. My best guess now is that the payload is an NRL Titan
Launch Dispenser which will deploy three ocean surveillance
subsatellites in an 1100 km orbit, or a Satellite Data Systems comsat
which will be placed by a kick motor into a Molniya-type elliptical
orbit.

India launched its Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle from Sriharikota on
May 26. PSLV-C2 launched the Oceansat (IRS-P4) satellite and two small
subsatellites, Korea's Kitsat-3 and Germany's DLR-Tubsat-C.  PSLV has a
solid stage 1 and stage 3 with a liquid stage 2 using an Ariane-derived
Vikas engine and a fourth stage with two small liquid engines.

The Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) IRS-P4 is a 1036 kg remote
sensing satellite with an ocean color imager experiment. The 110 kg
Kitsat-3 is built by the Korea Advanced Inst. of Technology (KAIST)
(earlier Kitsats were built in collaboration with Surrey Satellite) and
carries a small earth imager. The 45 kg DLR-Tubsat-C was built by the
Technical University of Berlin for the German space agency DLR, and also
carries an imager.

STS-93/Chandra
---------------

One month to launch!

(I assume it will not surprise readers if these newsletters become
even more irregular than usual for a while... we're just a *little*
busy here!)

The STS-93 stack was rolled out to pad 39B on Jun 7. The Chandra/IUS-27
vehicle was placed in the payload canister on Jun 19. It was to be
transferred to the pad on Jun 22, but problems with the pad service
structure have delayed the transfer to Jun 24. Launch is still scheduled
for Jul 20, but NASA Administrator Goldin has not yet approved the
launch; he's waiting for the failure report on IUS-21 earlier this year.

Recent Launches
---------------

Four Globalstar satellites were launched by Boeing Delta 7420-10 on Jun
10. The two-stage Delta deployed the satellites in an intermediate
orbit. The Globalstar satellites are built by Loral and Alenia, and will
provide L-band mobile personal communications. As of Jun 22 the
spacecraft were in 1410 km circular orbits at 52 deg inclination.

On Jun 11, two Iridium satellites were launched from Taiyuan, China on a
CALT Chang Zheng 2C with a Smart Dispenser upper stage. The satellites
replaced the failed Iridium 14 and Iridium 21. The Iridium satellites
are built by Motorola with a Lockheed Martin spacecraft bus; I don't
know the production numbers of these satellites.

A Krunichev/International Launch Services Proton-K took off from
Baykonur on Jun 18 and placed in orbit an Energiya Blok DM3 upper stage
with the Astra 1H payload. The DM3 ignited to enter a 200x  35854 km x
51.6 deg transfer orbit. A second DM3 burn six hours after launch was
successful in placing Astra in a 7474 x 35842 km x 16.4 deg
deployment orbit.

Astra 1H is a Hughes HS-601HP satellite with 28 Ku-band transponders and
two higher frequency Ka-band transponders to support Astra's Return
Channel System for two-way bandwidth-on-demand services. The satellite
carries a Marquardt R-4D liquid bipropellant apogee motor and a XIPS ion
propulsion system for stationkeeping. The Astra satellites are owned by
the Societe Europeene des Satellites (SES) and registered by Luxembourg.

NASA's QuikScat satellite was launched on Jun 20. QuikScat, built by
Ball under a rapid delivery contract, carries the SeaWinds scatterometer
for remote sensing of ocean winds. QuikScat was launched on  Titan
23G-7, a two-stage refurbished ICBM. Titan 23G-7 took off from Space
Launch Complex 4-West at Vandenberg at 0215 UTC. The second stage burned
from 0217 UTC to 0220 UTC. The second stage then coasted to apogee with
QuikScat still attached. Some descriptions of the mission implied that
the second stage would separate early and an apogee motor would be used
to achieve orbit (the NASA press kit even includes a drawing of such a
motor), but I believe this represents confusion with earlier Titan 23G
missions such as Landsat. On this mission, the payload entered
elliptical orbit at the end of the Titan second stage burn, and the
Titan second stage vernier thrusters ignited at apogee to raise perigee,
leaving QuikScat in a 280 x 813 km x 98.7 deg parking orbit. The
QuikScat's own hydrazine propulsion system will then fire to raise the
perigee further over a period of weeks.

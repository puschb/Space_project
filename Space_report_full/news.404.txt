STS-93/Chandra
---------------

LAUNCH! Chandra is in transfer orbit and is sending data back
to Cambridge. A beautiful launch with some scary moments.
And a wonderful trip to the Cape, it was great to finally meet
so many of you that I've corresponded with.

I set out from my hotel in Cocoa Beach on Monday afternoon. 
South of the Cape itself, there's a thin peninsula with
the towns of Cape Canaveral and Cocoa Beach, and the Cape's
administrative HQ at Patrick AFB. Driving up A1A from Cocoa Beach,
you pass United Space Alliance's Shuttle Logistics Depot, in a
building which looks to me like a car dealership. Passing the
turnoff for Cape Canaveral Air Station, I drove on across the Banana
River to Merritt Island, and north on State Road 3, stopping off
at Space Shirts to get my required STS-93 t-shirts and patches.
At the gate to KSC, it's still many miles to Complex 39. The VAB
looms large, and seems to stay the same size for ages, but eventually
I arrive. It's an immense building. Yes, I knew this, but the reality
is impressive. Across the road from the VAB is the LC39 press site,
with the famous countdown clock you've all seen on TV. The clock sits
by the water's edge at the end of a grassy field, behind which 
are the viewing stand and the NASA newsroom. Next to the newsroom
are the buildings for CBS, ABC, etc. and the trucks for the smaller
local TV stations. TRW's hospitality tent was at the bottom of
the field next to the clock. 

The first launch attempt was on Jul 20, and controllers commanded
an RSLS hold at T-6 seconds, just moments before main engine ignition.
A data spike in hydrogen pressure data was the problem; if it had
really been an indication that there was lots of hydrogen leaking
into the engine compartment, there would be danger of explosion, so
the cutoff was a good idea. 

Second try was Jul 22. Everything looked good except for one weather
system which was moving south out of the area. Fine, we'd still get off
within the 46 minute window. Then we saw a lightning flash. As the hold
wore on, the storm continued. It was dry at the LC39 press site, but we
kept seeing flashes and hearing thunderclaps in the distance. It became
clear that the chances of going that night were not good. 

Jul 23 was the charm.
Launch was at 0431:00 UTC from LC39B at Kennedy Space Center. 5 seconds
after launch, a short in an electrical bus brought down a main engine
controller on two of the main engines. There are three buses, each
supplying two main engine controllers. There are six engine controllers,
two for each main engine, and the two controllers for each engine always
run off different buses. So after the short, there was still at least
one controller working on each engine. If there had been a similar short
in a second electrical bus, then one of the main engines would have had
no working controllers, which would have resulted in the engine shutting
down. That early in the ascent, we'd have had the first ever attempt at
an RTLS (Return To Launch Site) abort. So to hear comm traffic about bad
engine controllers as Columbia was still streaking over the countdown
clock was rather alarming.  Happily, the short was not repeated and the
remainder of the ascent seemed solid (but see below). 

The main thing that surprised me was the intense collimated exhaust from
the SRBs. In all of the photos I've seen, the exhaust is so overexposed
that there's no sign of this: in the middle of the broader bright smoke,
there were twin narrow columns of eyeball-searing, actinic,
magnesium-flare-like emission, as if a pair of cracks had opened in
spacetime to let a bit of the primordial fireball peek through. I don't
remember seeing this from the STS-37 daytime launch, but I was further
away for that one. The other thing was the noise. The loud rumble of the
SSME ignition reached us a few seconds after launch, and was then
overwhelmed by the remarkable crackling and popping noise that I assume
was the SRBs. The Ariane launch I saw last year had a similar quality to
it, and again I've never heard it sound like this on TV broadcasts. We
were just able to follow SRB separation through the haze, and the SSMEs
were visible until about 5 minutes into the flight.

Main engine cutoff (MECO) was at 0439 UTC, and the external tank
separated leaving Columbia in a 78 x 276 km x 28.5 deg transfer orbit.
The engines cut off slightly early when the LOX supply ran out (about
1700 kg short), leaving Columbia short of speed by 5 meters/s.  NASA now
believes that engine no. 3 had a small hydrogen leak throughout the
ascent, causing the engine to run hot. The OMS-2 engine burn at 0512 UTC
circularized the orbit, about 10 km lower than planned.

At around 1000 UTC the IUS ASE tilt table was raised 29 degrees out of
the payload bay, and the Chandra lower antenna was tested. At 1142 UTC
the IUS ASE was raised to 58 degrees, the deployment angle.

Chandra/IUS-27 was deployed from Columbia at 1147 UTC Jul 23. At 1248
UTC the IUS-27 SRM-1 motor fired for 125s to enter a 226 x 13841 km x
28.5 deg orbit. The SRM-1 then separated (it appears that a second
object may also be being tracked in this orbit) and SRM-2 fired at 1251
UTC for 117 seconds. Chandra then deployed its solar arrays at 1322 UTC,
 and SRM-2 separated from Chandra at 1350 UTC. Chandra was placed in a
330 x 72030 km x 28.45 deg orbit. This was about 900 km lower than
planned, the IUS underperformed slightly, but Chandra's own IPS
propulsion system will make up most of the difference. The ACIS and HRC
cameras have been switched on and both are operating well, although we
won't open the lid to see the sky till mid-August.

At 0111 UTC on Jul 25 we fired the IPS engines for 5 minutes to raise
perigee to 1192 km. The IPS engineer was very happy! The burn went well
and the vehicle was extremely stable. We are waiting for DSN to measure
the new orbit. Further burns will raise orbit further to 10000 km x
140000 km. 

TRW's IPS propulsion system is a dual-mode system, with O2/hydrazine 
for the four main 450N  IPS engines, and mono hydrazine for the RCS
system. There's also a small momentum dumping hydrazine system that is
used throughout the mission for attitude control when the momentum
wheels get saturated. Any extra hydrazine left over when the O2 runs out
will be transferred to that system.

Chandra is the heaviest Shuttle payload yet. It's hard to do the bookkeeping,
because total cargo masses aren't easy to come by, they usually just release
'payload chargeable weight', and orbit insertion mass is harder to find than
the less interesting launch mass. But, for what it's worth, my best estimates
for the heaviest Shuttle flights are:
  - Launch mass of orbiter
     STS-93 (Chandra)   122534 kg
     STS51L (TDRS 2)    121530 kg (failed to orbit)
     STS-41D (PAM)      119576 kg
     STS-51A (PAM)      119454 kg
     STS-90  Neurolab   119003 kg

   Total cargo mass
     STS-93 (Chandra)    25700 kg approx?
     STS51L (TDRS 2)     23884 kg
     STS-41  (ULS)       22665 kg
     STS-43 (TDRS 5)     22373
     STS-54 (TDRS 6)     22244

   Mass of deployed payload:
     Chandra/IUS-27     19736 kg (planned)
     Magellan/IUS-18    18197 kg
     Ulysses/IUS-17     17510 kg
     USA-8/IUS-11       17400 kg? (estimate)
     USA-48/IUS-5       17400 kg? (estimate)
     Galileo/IUS-19     17383 kg
     TDRS-7/IUS-26      17107 kg
     TDRS-4/IUS-9       17073 kg
     TDRS-B/IUS-3       17071 kg (not deployed, launch failure)
     DSP-16/IUS-14      17050 kg
     TDRS-5/IUS-15      17044 kg
     TDRS-1/IUS-1       17030 kg
     TDRS-3/IUS-7       17016 kg
     TDRS-6/IUS-13      17008 kg
     DSCS/IUS-12        17000 kg? (estimate)

The IUS has been used on 15 Shuttle flights. The IUS itself is not
reusable, but the tilt table and airborne support equipment (ASE)
is; there have been three IUS ASEs  flown. ASE-1 made only two
flights, on STS-6 and on 51-L when it was destroyed. ASE-2 made 7
flights, and ASE-3, built to replace the lost ASE-1, has made 6 flights
if as I suspect it was used on the current mission (haven't managed to 
confirm this).  The previous flights of ASE-3 are believed to be 
STS-30 (Magellan), STS-33R, STS-43 (TDRS 5), STS-54 (TDRS 6) and STS-70 
(TDRS 7). 


There have been a number of other RSLS holds in the STS program:
 1984 Jun 26  41-D    RSLS abort T-6s
 1985 Jul 12  51-F    RSLS abort T-3s
 1985 Dec 18  61-C    RSLS hold  T-14s
 1993 Mar 22  STS-55  RSLS abort T-3s
 1993 Apr  6  STS-56  RSLS hold  T-11s
 1993 Jul 24  STS-51  RSLS hold  T-19s
 1993 Aug 12  STS-51  RSLS abort T-3s
 1994 Aug 18  STS-58  RSLS abort T-2s
 1998 Dec  3  STS-88  RSLS hold  T-19s
 1999 Jul 20  STS-93  RSLS hold  T-6s

Recent Launches
---------------

The Progress M-42 cargo ship was launched Jul 16. It is bringing
supplies to the crew of the Mir complex. Progress M-42 docked with
the Kvant port at 1753 UTC on Jul 18.  Progress M-41 undocked 
at 1120 UTC on Jul 17 and was deorbited over the Pacific later the
same day.  Viktor  Afanas'ev and Sergey Avdeev made a spacewalk on
Jul 23 at 1106 UTC for about 6 hours (no confirmed duration yet).
They installed a new antenna but failed to deploy it. Jean-Pierre
Haignere remained inside Mir during the EVA.

An Okean-O remote sensing satellite was launched by a Zenit-2 from
Baykonur on Jul 17. This is the first of a new generation of larger
Okean oceanographic satellites, with a mass of about 6500 kg. It was
placed in a sun-synchronous 661 x 662 km x 98.0 deg orbit. The satellite
carries a side-looking radar (RSL-BO), and a set of visible and infrared
 scanners and radiometers. It is built by the Ukranian Yuzhnoe company
and is a joint project of the Russian Aviation/Space Agency (RAKA) and
the Ukrainian National Space Agency (NKAU).

Four more Globalstar satellites were launched Jul 25 by a Boeing Delta 2.
The  Delta 2 second stage entered a 185 x 1361 km transfer orbit 11 minutes
after launch. At 61 min after launch the second stage restarted at apogee
and  deployed the four satellites in a 1367 km circular orbit. Meanwhile the
four Globalstars launched on Jul 10 are already in their 1410 x 1414 km x 52.0
deg operational orbits.

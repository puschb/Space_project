Chandra
---------------

Chandra's first light image has been released:
http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~jcm/space/jsr/cas.jpg

It's been an amazing few weeks. We opened the sunshade door and  looked
at the quasar PKS 0637-75, an old favorite of mine, expecting it to be a
point source that would be good for focussing, but we could easily see
X-rays from the quasar radio jet sticking out to the side. Turns out we
were pretty well focussed anyway. Only a few radio jets have been seen
in the X-ray before now, so seeing one in this quasar suggest to me that
we'll be seeing a lot of them in other objects (specifically,
flat-spectrum radio quasars like this one, in which we know the jet is
pointing close to the line of sight). We looked at the supernova remnant
Cas A, and saw lots of detail including a possible neutron star compact
remnant in the center. After checking out the ACIS camera, we turned to
the HRC camera which has also been working  spectacularly. The HETG
grating has also been tested out, making a high resolution spectrum of
the bright star Capella. So far, so good! In fact better than good -
pretty much everything we've looked at so far has fascinating surprises.
Of course, there are the usual detailed issues with the processing
software, and lots of numbers to tweak from on-orbit measurements, so
although all in all things have been working remarkably well, there's
been no shortage of things for us to do. Orbital activation and checkout
will be completed later this month, at which point hopefully I start
working less than 16-hour days.

Shuttle and Mir
---------------

For the first time since Sep 1989 there are no humans in space. The Mir
EO-27 crew landed in Kazakhstan at 0035 UTC on Aug 28. Soyuz TM-29
undocked from Mir at 2117 UTC on Aug 27 with Afanas'ev, Avdeev and
Haignere aboard. The hatch between Mir and Soyuz was closed for
the last time at 1812 UTC.

The Shuttle fleet remains grounded while NASA continues checks
and repairs to the wiring in the Orbiters. Launches might
resume by late October.

Recent Launches
---------------

Arianespace launched Koreasat 3 for Korea Telecom on Sep 4 on an Ariane
42P rocket. The H-10-3 third stage placed Koreasat 3 in a 214 x  35756
km x 7.0 deg transfer orbit. Koreasat 3 is a Lockheed Martin/Sunnyvale
A2100 class comsat with both Ka and Ku band transponders. Launch mass
was 2790 kg; it will be located at 116 deg E.

The first two Yamal comsats were launched by Krunichev's Proton on Sep
6. An Energiya DM-2M (11S861-01) upper stage placed the satellites in a
197 x  36311 km x  49.3 deg geostationary transfer orbit according to
Space Command data, but this seems to be an error since Energiya reports
that the DM-2M made two successful burns, which would have left the
satellites in circular 36000 km orbit. Stay tuned for clarification of
this issue. Yamal 101 reportedly ran into problems after it was
deployed.

RKK Energiya is building the Yamal 101 and 102 satellites for AO Gazcom
of Moscow, a joint venture of RKKE and  RAO Gazprom, the Russian natural
gas monopoly. The two Yamal-100 satellites each carry a communications
payload of 12 C-band transponders built by Space Systems/Loral, and will
support  internal communications for RAO Gazprom.  Satellite mass is
1360 kg. The satellite carries Fakel SPD-70 plasma thrusters for
inclination control.

Launch pad for Kosmos-2365 was PU3 at Plesetsk LC43 according to
Aleksandr Zheleznyakov. (Last week's issue had  a typo).

Kosmos-2366 was launched on Aug 26 by a two-stage 11K65M rocket from
Plesetsk into an 83 degree orbit. Kosmos-2366 is a Parus-class
navigation satellite built by Polyot of Omsk.

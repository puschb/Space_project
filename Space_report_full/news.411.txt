Web Site Updated
-----------------

My web site, http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~jcm/space/space.html
has undergone a significant update.

A major new feature is the index of geostationary launches. In addition
to my usual list of current orbital postions, I've added a historical
listing of which longitudes the various satellites have ever been
stationed at, an estimate of the time each satellite first entered the
near-geostationary region (which I define to be orbital periods between
23 and 25 hours), and an estimate of the time the satellite ceased
operating. I hope readers who have geostationary satellites of their own
will help me correct and improve this listing, which is at 
 http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~jcm/space/logs/geo.date

Recent Launches
---------------

Plans are to launch Discovery on STS-103 in early December.
Discovery has been mated to external tank ET-101 and solid boosters
RSRM-73, and was rolled out from VAB bay 1 to the pad on Nov 13.

GE 4 was launched by Ariane on Nov 13. The GE 4 satellite will provide C
and Ku-band communications services for GE Americom, replacing the older
Spacenet 4 satellite. It is an A2100AX type spacecraft built by Lockheed
Martin/Sunnyvale. Arianespace used an Ariane 44LP rocket to place GE 4
in geostationary transfer orbit.

Below I list all the satellites in GE Americom (formerly RCA Americom)'s
fleet. The early satellites were built by RCA/GE/Lockheed Martin's
East Windsor operation; the A2100s were built by LM/Sunnyvale; and
GE 5 was built by Alcatel/Cannes.

NASDA's H-2 rocket failed four minutes after launch from Tanegashima on
Nov 15. The H-2 jettisoned its two large solid boosters 1.5 min after
launch, but toward the end of the burn of the large first stage
something went wrong - details so far unknown - and the rocket was lost.
This H-2 carried the 5S type fairing and a new second stage with the
LE-5B engine being developed for the H-2A program, but the accident
happened before second stage ignition. 

The payload was the Multi-functional Transportation Satellite, with a
communications and air traffic control payload for the Japanese
transportation ministry and a meteorological payload for the Japanese
Meteorological Agency. MTSAT was built by Space Systems/Loral and based
on their FS-1300 series comsat bus. MTSAT had a mass of 1223 kg dry,
2900 kg at launch. The spacecraft was a follow-on to the GMS (Himawari)
weather satellite series.

The AP report on the launch failure includes Japan's repeated erroneous
claim that it was the first nation to dock two satellites under remote
control. In fact, the ETS-7 experiment last year came 30 years after
the first remote control docking by the USSR's Kosmos-186 and Kosmos-188.

Recent Launches

The Mars Polar Lander spacecraft reached Mars on Dec 3. The lander
separated from the cruise stage at 1951 UTC and the two Deep Space 2
penetrators, Scott and Amundsen,  were scheduled to separate about 20   
seconds later. Nothing has been heard from any of the three spacecraft,
and it now seems possible that all perished during atmospheric entry and
landing. Landing was expected at 2001 UTC at 76.1S 195.3W, with the
penetrators landing a few km from each other at 75.0S 196.5W at the same
time.

Unless one of the probes is heard from, a prospect that fades with each
passing day, this is a further hard blow for the JPL team. The lack of
telemetry during descent will make it very hard to settle on a detailed
cause of failure, and Mars landings are never easy (it's only been done
successfully three times - Viking 1 and 2, and Mars Pathfinder). It is
not even clear if MPL and the DS2 penetrators separated from the cruise
stage successfully. The next Mars Surveyor launch is currently scheduled
for March 2001.   

The French Helios 1B spy satellite was launched from Kourou on Dec 3
into sun-synchronous orbit. The spacecraft is based on the Matra Marconi
Space Spot 4 bus. Mass is 2544 kg. The small Surrey Satellite/Alcatel
Space Clementine electronic intelligence technology satellite was also
deployed from the third stage of the Ariane launch vehicle.  Clementine
is a followon to the Cerise satellite launched in 1995. The launch
vehicle was an Ariane 40, with no strapon boosters, using the small type
02 fairing for the first time since 1996. Helios 1B will be operated by
the CNES space agency and the DGA (Delegation Generale de l'Armament).

The Orbital Sciences L-1011 Stargazer launch aircraft took off from one
of the runways (anyone know which?) at Wallops Flight Facility at about
1751 UTC on Dec 4 and headed out over the Atlantic to launch a Pegasus
XL rocket. The drop point was probably in the vicinity of 37.0 deg N,
72.0 deg W. The Pegasus placed seven Orbcomm satellites in orbit. The
Pegasus third stage entered a 407 x 726 km x 45.0 deg orbit. Two burns
by the HAPS fourth stage led to deployment of the Orbcomms in an 820 x
840 km x 45.0 deg operational orbit. After a third depletion burn the
HAPS stage was left in a 372 x 827 km x 41.0 deg orbit. Earlier Orbcomm
launches had a stack of eight satellites; it isn't clear why only seven
were flown on this mission.


The Oldest Spacecraft
---------------------

I'm often asked how many active satellites are in orbit - this is a
really hard number to derive, but I've recently tried to count them and
my best guess is that there are currently between 650 and 800 working
Earth satellites (including anything that can still communicate with Earth,
even if it is not fully operational) and 18 spacecraft beyond Earth orbit.
The oldest spacecraft definitely working are TRW's Pioneer 6, 7 and 8
interplanetary probes; Pioneer 6 is 34 years old. The oldest Earth
satellite is probably the Hughes HS-306 satellite ATS 3, in
geostationary orbit since 1967. However, the 1966 ITT/US Army Secor
geodetic satellite EGRS 7 was reported in 1980 to be still transmitting,
so it's just possible it's still around. NATO IIA, a Ford (now Loral)
satellite from 1970, is in the stable geostationary location at 105W, 
and it's not possible to tell whether it is still under control. Here I 
give a list of the oldest satellites not definitely known to be defunct.
I'd be very interested in hearing of definite death dates for any of
these, or any active ones I've missed.

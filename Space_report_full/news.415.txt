Shuttle
-------

Space Shuttle OV-103 Discovery was launched at 0050 UTC on Dec 20 on
Hubble servicing mission SM-3A. At 0058 UTC the external tank ET-101
separated leaving the Orbiter in a 56 x 587 km x 28.5 deg transfer
orbit. The OMS 2 burn at 0134 UTC raised the orbit to 313 x 582 km.
Hubble is in a 591 x 610 km x 28.5 deg orbit, and Discovery will
rendezvous with it on Tuesday.

Discovery's payload bay contains:
 Bay 1-2: External airlock/ODS
 Bay 7-8: ORU Carrier (Spacelab pallet)
 Bay 11:  Flight Servicing System (FSS)
 Bay 8 port?: APC carrier with foot restraint
 Bay 12 port?: APC carrier with HST foot retstraint

The ORU Carrier contains the COPE protective enclosure with the three
RSU gyros, the new solid state recorder, and the S-band transmitter; the
LOPE enclosure with an HST-486 computer and the voltage improvement kit;
the ASIPE enclosure with the spare HST-486 and spare RSU; the FSIPE
enclosure with the replacement FGS-2 fine guidance sensor; and the NPE
enclosure with the New Outer Blanket Layer insulation.

The FSS contains the BAPS (Berthing and Positioning System) used to dock
with the aft end of the Hubble Space Telescope. Discovery will
rendezvous with HST, grapple it with the RMS manipulator arm, and  berth
it on the BAPS. Astronauts will then make at least three spacewalks to
change out the equipment on HST. Finally, Discovery will release the
telescope back into orbit.

Crew of STS-103 are Curt Brown (Commander), Scott Kelly (Pilot), Steven
Smith (Payload Commander),  John Grunsfeld, Michael Foale, Claude
Nicollier, and Jean-Francois Clervoy (Mission Specialists). Nicollier
and Clervoy are European Space Agency astronauts.

Recent Launches
---------------

NASA's Terra satellite (formerly Earth Observing System EOS AM-1) was
launched from SLC-3E at Vandenberg on Dec 18 by a Lockheed Martin
Astronautics Atlas 2AS, mission AC-141. This was the first Centaur
launched from Vandenberg and the first Atlas to use the new extended
length 4.3-m payload fairing. Terra is the first spacecraft in the EOS
program, and was built by Lockheed Martin/Valley Forge, who also built
the earlier Nimbus series of spacecraft. The spacecraft was placed in a
654 x 684 km x 98.2 deg orbit. The Centaur stage then made a depletion
burn and was left in a 355 x 654 km x 98.3 deg orbit. The 4854 kg Terra
carries multispectral imagers, a radiation budget instrument,  a
detector to measure CO and methane pollution,  and an instrument to
study cloud top and vegetation properties,

Space Launch Complex 3-East was originally Launch Complex 1-2 at the
Naval Missile Facility, Point Arguello. It was used starting in 1961 for
MIDAS and SAMOS launches, and in 1966-68 for SV-5D lifting body launches
and an Atlas Burner 2 launch. In 1978 it was reactivated for Atlas E and
F launches of Navstar GPS satellites, and from 1983 to 1987 was used for
Atlas H launches of the classified Navy triplet ocean surveillance
satellites. 

XMM has safely reached its final orbit. It will be put in safemode on
Dec 20 until early January to avoid any Y2K problems caused by ground
systems. Instrument checkout will begin in early January.

 XMM Orbit raising burns:
 Sep     Dec 10 1501 UTC   826 x 113946 km x 38.9
 DV-1A   Dec 11 1220 UTC  2531 x 114042 km x 38.9 (estimate)
 DV-1B   Dec 11 1413 UTC  4897 x 114002 km x 38.9
 DV-2    Dec 13 1225 UTC  6480 x 113990 km x 39.9
 DV-3    Dec 15 1210 UTC  7359 x 113975 km x 38.9
 DV-4    Dec 16 1130 UTC  7365 x 113774 km x 38.9 (estimate)

The DMSP 5D-3 satellite was built by Lockheed Martin/East Windsor (the
former RCA), not at Valley Forge (former GE). Apologies for the error,
I got confused between it and the Terra launch.

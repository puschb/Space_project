Obituary
--------

Geoff Perry, the world renowned founder of the Kettering Group, died
suddenly in Cornwall on Jan 18 at the age of 72. Geoff, formerly a
physics teacher at Kettering Grammar School, taught his students to
track short wave radio signals from Soviet satellites, and eventually
established a world-wide network of experts who figured out what was
going on in the Soviet space program. He and his team came to public
prominence in 1966 with their independent discovery of the Plesetsk
launch site. I'm glad that Geoff lived long enough to see the
declassification of the former Soviet missions and discover that the
`answers in the back of the book' agreed for the most part with his own
sleuthing, but I'll miss his insight and comprehensive knowledge. 

Errata
------

Some errata: I am glad to report the Rokot launch vehicle at
Plesetsk was not damaged in the December accident, and neither
was the payload. Only the fairing was ejected and written off.
Krunichev will therefore most likely be able to launch the
vehicle this spring. However, the new plan is to launch two
dummy satellites and use the uprated Briz-KM upper stage; see below.

In JSR417 I listed KOMPSAT as a KAIST (Korea Adv. Inst of Space Tech.)
project, which was a mistake - I got it right in JSR 416, it is a KARI
(Korea Aerospace Research Inst.) mission. KARI, in Taejon, also
flies Korea's sounding rockets and will develop the Korean satellite
launch vehicle.


Galileo
-------
Galileo safely completed the Europa-26 encounter on Jan 3.
At 1800 UTC on Jan 3 Galileo passed 343 km from Europa;
at 0333 on Jan 4 it flew 343000 km from Jupiter's cloud tops;
at 0656 on Jan 4 it flew 214000 km from Io. The Galileo
Europa Mission ends on Jan 31, to be followed by the Galileo
Millenium Mission which is likely to be approved in the next
few weeks.


Rokot
-----
In penance for spreading the incorrect Rokot rumour, and since we're
short on launches this week, I'll present some details of the Rokot
launch vehicle.

The first ICBM designed by the Chelomei bureau (the ancestor of the
Krunichev company), the UR-100 rocket (article 8K84) was first tested on
1965 Apr 19. The UR series of Universal Rockets also included the larger
UR-200 missile, tested in 1963 but then cancelled, and the UR-500 which
became today's Proton space launch vehicle. The UR-100 was 1.6m in
diameter; its replacement UR-100N (article 15A30) was a larger 2.5m
diameter rocket which could fit in the same silo. The UR-100N was test 
flown for the first time on 1973 Apr 9 (although some sources suggest 
1972). As part of a general upgrade of Soviet missiles, the UR-100NUTTKh
version (the UTTKh abbreviation means `tactical-technical upgrade') was
test-flown starting on 1977 Oct 26. The UR-100N and UR-100NUTTKh rockets
have now made about 145 flights with only 3 failures. They are
known to NATO as the SS-19 (the original UR-100 was the SS-11)

The hydrazine/nitrogen tetroxide fuelled  UR-100NUTTKh has two main
stages and a post-boost stage all using engines from KB Khivavtomatiki;
four RD-0233 on stage 1, one RD-0235 (and four small RD-0236 verniers) 
on stage 2, and one RD-0237 on the post-boost stage.

The Rokot launch vehicle is based on refurbished UR-100NUTTKh missiles
with a Briz upper stage replacing the post-boost stage.  Rokot (which
means `roar') is marketed in the West by EUROCKOT Launch Services, a
joint venture between DaimlerChrysler Aerospace and Krunichev. (They put
a 'c' in 'Rockot', probably to make it sound more like 'rocket'). The
original 14S12 Briz-K is conical in shape, probably matching the size of
the old post-boost stage. It uses the KB KhimMash S5.92 engine that was
flown on the Fobos probes' ADU stage and will also be part of the new
Fregat upper stage from Lavochkin. The S5.92 has a thrust of 20kN.
Future launches of Rokot will use the 14S45 Briz-KM which is a
repackaged Briz-K, cylindrical in shape and with a larger payload
adapter and fairing. A 14S43 Briz-M has also been developed which is a
Briz-KM with an extra torus fuel tank, for use as a Proton upper stage,
but its first chance at a test flight was lost when the Proton carrier
vehicle crashed last summer.

There have been three test flights of the Rokot so far. The first two  
were deliberate suborbital flights of which few details are available;
the apogee was around 900 km, and the Briz stage was fired several
times, but it's not clear what the maximum velocity reached was, and so
I don't know how close the flights were to reaching orbit. The third
flight was an orbital test flight which placed a small 70 kg test
satellite (Radio-ROSTO) in a 1881 x 2163 km x 65 deg orbit. The Briz  
stage disintegrated a few hours later generating dozens of pieces of
cataloged orbital debris; I'm guessing this problem has been fixed
in the new Briz-KM, probably with a depletion burn.

As far as I am aware, all launches so far of the UR-100 and UR-100N
series rockets have been from the Baykonur spaceport. The forthcoming
test launch of Rokot will be from complex 133 at Plesetsk, where
Krunichev has taken over an old Kosmos pad. The new pad verification
test launch is now expected to carry a pair of dummy satellites;
space.com suggests they will be simulated Iridium satellites, since the
bankrupt Iridium still has the first commercial booking of Rokot later
this year (A similar pair of dummy Iridium payloads was used on the
first test launch of the Chinese CZ-2C/SD).

The UR-100NUTTKh second stage places the payload stack in a -2727 x 256
km suborbital trajectory. The first Briz-KM burn 5 min after launch
will put the stack in a 200 x 700 km transfer orbit, and the second Briz
burn 64 min after launch circularizes the orbit at apogee.

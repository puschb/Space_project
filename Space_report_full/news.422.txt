Shuttle and Stations
--------------------

The next Shuttle mission is STS-101, to the international space station.
Crew are James Halsell, Scott Horowitz, Mary Ellen Weber, Jeffrey
Williams, James Voss, Susan Helms, and Yuriy Usachev. Atlantis will
carry the External Airlock/Orbiter Docking System, the Spacehab Long
Tunnel, the Keel Yoke Device with the Integrated Cargo Carrier (ICC)
pallet, and the Spacehab Logistics Double Module. A GAS canister
in bay 13 port contains the SEM-6 and MARS high school experiments.
The ICC carries parts of the ISS Strela robot arm and a Shuttle
GPS navigation experiment.

The launch of Soyuz TM-30 with the EO-28 Mir crew is scheduled
for Apr 4. Commander is Sergey V. Zalyotin; flight engineer is
Aleksandr Kaleri.

Recent Launches
---------------

The Multispectral Thermal Imager (MTI), USAF Space Test Program mission
P97-3, was launched by Orbital Sciences Taurus on Mar 12. MTI is a
Sandia Labs mission to test out a multispectral imager for treaty
monitoring applications. The mission used a Taurus 1110 rocket with a
63-inch fairing and a Peacekeeper first stage. The satellite is in a 577
x 613 km x 97.4 deg orbit.

The first ICO Global Communications satellite was lost when its
Zenit-3SL launch vehicle failed on Mar 12. ICO F-1 was a 2750 kg Hughes
HS-601M satellite and would have entered a 10300 km x 45 deg circular
orbit.  ICO's satellites carry multiple spot beams for mobile
communications. The Zenit-3SL vehicle took of from Boeing Sea Launch's
Odyssey platform in the Pacific at 154W 0N. The Zenit second stage shut
down prematurely due to a valve commanding mistake in the prelaunch
sequence, and the satellite fell in the South Pacific, possibly south of
Pitcairn. The fact that the error has been discovered quickly and seems
to be a simple software mistake means the downtime for Sea Launch may be
relatively short.

The second Ekspress A Russian communications satellite was successfully
launched on Mar 12 by a Krunichev Proton-K from Baykonur. Ekspress A No.
2 will be assigned to the Ekspress 6A slot at 80E, providing
communications for GO Kosmicheskaya Svyaz. The first Ekspress A was lost
in a launch failure last year. The Ekspress A is built by NPO PM,
with a communications payload from Alcatel. The Proton-K used an
Energiya Blok DM-2M upper stage.


USAF Space Command launched a Peacekeeper missile from silo LF-05 at
Vandenberg at 0940 UTC on Mar 8. Operational test mission GT29PA was
scheduled to carry 8 reentry vehicles to the Kwajalein Atoll target
area. These suborbital flights reach apogees of around 1000 km. The
Peacekeeper's first stage is similar to the first stage of the Taurus
and Athena space launch vehicles.

The second test launch of the Soyuz-Fregat launch vehicle succeeded
on Mar 20. The Fregat upper stage placed a dummy satellite, Dumsat,
into orbit. Dumsat, built by Aerospatiale Matra, is a mass model
of a pair of Cluster II scientific satellites. Dumsat remained
attached to the Fregat stage, in a 244 x 18016 km x 64.6 deg orbit.
The Soyuz third stage flew a suborbital trajectory.


The first fully commercial Ariane 5 flight successfully placed two
comsats, Asiastar and Insat 3B, in geostationary transfer orbit on Mar
21. Worldspace's second digital radio satellite is Asiastar, a Matra
Marconi Space Eurostar 2000+ satellite with a dry mass of 1220 kg.
Asiastar joins Afristar in orbit with a mission of providing radio
broadcasting to and by communities in the developing world. Insat 3B was
accelerated to replace the lost Insat 2D and carries a pure telecom
payload of C, Ku and S band transponders, unlike earlier Insats which
also had weather instruments. The satellite was built by ISRO, the
Indian Space Research Organization, and has a dry mass of 970 kg.
Ariane 5's EPS upper stage was left in a 699 x 35445 km x 7.0 deg
orbit. The EPC core stage reentered over the Galapagos Islands after
completing most of one orbit.


NASA's IMAGE satellite was launched on Mar 25. IMAGE, the Imager for
Magnetopause to Aurora Global Exploration, is a MIDEX (mid-sized
Explorer mission) and was developed by NASA-Goddard and the SWRI
(Southwest Research Institute of San Antonio, Texas). The
spin-stabilized spacecraft is a Lockheed Martin LM100. It carries a set
of neutral atom imagers and ultraviolet imagers, and antennae to study
radio wavelength emissions from the magnetospheric plasma. The RPI radio
plasma imager has four long wire antennae which will be deployed to a
span of half a kilometer. 

IMAGE was launched by a Boeing Delta 7326 from Space Launch Complex
2-West at Vandenberg AFB. The 7326 uses three strapon GEM-40 boosters, 
a long tank Delta II Thor first stage, a Delta II second stage with an
Aerojet AJ-10-118K engine, and a Thiokol Star 37FM third stage solid
motor. The Delta second stage made a single burn to a 185 x 1076 km x
93.9 deg orbit and separated from the Star 37 whose burn left IMAGE in a
987 x 45993 km x 89.9 deg final orbit.

Shuttle and Stations
--------------------

The Soyuz TM-30 spacecraft was launched on Apr 4 with the EO-28 Mir
crew. Commander is Sergey V. Zalyotin; flight engineer is Aleksandr
Kaleri. The spacecraft, production vehicle 11F732 No. 204, is the first
in the "200" series of Soyuz TM vehicles to fly. These vehicles were
originally built to support the International Space Station and are
externally similar to the standard Soyuz TM, with a cylindrical service
module (PAO), curved-conical descent module (SA), and  spheroidal living
module (BO). Mounted on the BO is a standard Mir SSVP-type probe docking
system.

The 11A511U Soyuz-U launch vehicle, built by TsSKB-Progress of Samara,
took off from the Gagarin pad at 5-GIK Baykonur at 0501:29 UTC. The four
Blok B,V,G,D strapon liquid boosters separated at 0503 UTC. Two minutes
into flight the escape tower separated and at 0504 UTC the nose fairing
was jettisoned at an altitude of 85 km. The central stage (Blok A) of
the Soyuz 'packet' continued on a suborbital trajectory, shutting down
and separating at 0506 UTC. The third stage, the Blok-I (possibly
designated 11S510) fired its KB Khivavtomatiki 11D55 LOX/kerosene main
engine for a four minute burn, placing Soyuz TM-30 in a low Earth orbit.
The antennae and solar panels were deployed shortly afterwards. Two
Soyuz engine burns at 0837 and 0923 UTC placed the vehicle in a 257 x
259 km x 51.6 deg orbit. It is not yet clear how long the EO-28 crew
will stay aboard Mir. Part of the EO-28 mission is financed by the
private MirCorp company.

The Mir complex is currently in a 329 x 333 km x 51.6 deg orbit.
The Progress M1-1 cargo ship is docked to the +X docking port of the
Kvant module. The -X docking port on the Mir base module transfer
compartment is waiting for Soyuz TM-30. The Kvant-2, Priroda,
Kristall and Spektr modules remain docked to the radial ports
on the base module (Spektr remains depressurized following the
1997 collision with Progress M-34).

The next Shuttle mission is STS-101, to the international space station.
Crew are James Halsell, Scott Horowitz, Mary Ellen Weber, Jeffrey
Williams, James Voss, Susan Helms, and Yuriy Usachev. Atlantis will
carry the External Airlock/Orbiter Docking System, the Spacehab Long
Tunnel, the Keel Yoke Device with the Integrated Cargo Carrier (ICC)
pallet, and the Spacehab Logistics Double Module. A GAS canister
in bay 13 port contains the SEM-6 and MARS high school experiments.
The ICC carries parts of the ISS Strela robot arm and a Shuttle
GPS navigation experiment.


Errata
-------

A friend at Arianespace points out that I should have said that the
Ariane 5 EPC stage impacts the Pacific *west* of the Galapagos, not
*over* the Galapagos - so readers on those islands do not need to duck.
The EPC stages are unusual in that they attain marginal orbits, with
perigees within the atmosphere but with quite high apogees - I don't
have definitive values but possibly around 1000 km. Most launch vehicle
suborbital stages have much less velocity at cutoff. The Ariane 505
mission now makes three perfect launches in a row for Ariane 5, which
following its earlier rocky start places it in a good position relative
to the other new generation launch vehicles (e.g. Delta 3, Atlas 3)
which have not yet successfully flown.

MTI is a joint mission of Sandia Labs and Los Alamos, together with the
Savannah River Technology Center.

The orbit I gave for the Delta second stage from the IMAGE launch was
the initial one; after the depletion burn the stage was left in a
193 x 1059 km x 91.3 deg orbit.

Always Initialize Your Variables
---------------------------------

The failure report for the Mars Polar Lander suggests that the most probable
cause was a software error in the landing sequence: during final descent,
the lander has rocket engines to slow it down:
  while ( not touched down ) { fire braking rockets }
Unfortunately, the 'touched down'  signal was not set to false at the
beginning of this loop, and was probably set to true earlier in the descent
when the shock of landing leg deployment was detected by the touchdown sensor.


Euphemism Corner
----------------

ESA's public affairs continue to rival the experts at NASA for their use
of  euphemism in press releases; the latest release is entitled "Cluster
II Flight Acceptance Review Report" instead of something more
straightforward  like "Propulsion Concerns Cause Possible Cluster II
Delay". The abstract of the release just says ".. carry out a detailed
examination of all aspects of the mission", which is certainly true, but
if you read all the way through you discover that the DaimlerChrysler
S400 propulsion system used on Cluster is apparently suspect, and
shipment of the four spacecraft to the launch site is being delayed. The
S400 class engine has heritage dating back to the Europa and Symphonie
programs  in the early 1970s, so I'm not too concerned about the
fundamental design, but reading between the lines  it sounds like there
have been some minor problems on recent comsats using the system. Let's
hope any delay is small. Cluster II is a group of four space science
satellites replacing those lost on the first Ariane 5 launch.

Current Launches
----------------

The NEAR-Shoemaker probe moved into a 100 x 200 km orbit around (433) Eros
on Apr 2 at 0200 UTC.

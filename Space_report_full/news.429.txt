Shuttle and Stations
--------------------

Soyuz TM-30 landed on Jun 16 at 0044 UTC. Zalyotin and Kaleri closed the
hatch to Mir at 1817 UTC on Jun 15 and undocked at 0124 UT on Jun 16.
The deorbit burn was at 0352 UTC; a few minutes later the orbital module
and service module were jettisoned, with the central descent module
reentering for a landing at 0044 UTC near Arkalyk in Kazakstan. The Mir
complex remains operational in automated mode.

Current Launches
----------------

An Ekspress A communications satellite was launched on Jun 24. The
Krunichev Proton-K launch vehicle flew a standard profile to place the
Energiya Blok DM-2M upper stage in a low parking orbit at 51.6 deg
inclination. Two Blok DM burns then delivered Ekspress A No. 3 to
geostationary orbit; on Jul 3 it was in a drift orbit of 35965 x 36081
km x 0.2 deg. Ekspress A No. 3 will use the on-orbit name Ekspress 3A.

China launched its second Fengyun-2 weather satellite on  Jun 25 using a
Chang Zheng 3 three-stage launch vehicle. The CZ-3 third stage and the
FY-2 satellite were placed in geostationary transfer orbit. The CZ-3
took off from Xichang at 1150 UTC; the third stage placed it in a
parking orbit at 1201 UTC and reignited for a second burn to transfer
orbit with spacecraft separation at 1213 UTC. FY-2 is around 1400 kg and
is spin-stabilized, similar to the older generation GOES satellites and
the Himawari and Meteosat satellites. It carries a solid apogee motor
which is ejected after use; this appears to have fired early on Jun 26. 
The first FY-2 was retired in April after a three year mission. By July
3, the new FY-2 was in a 35791 x 35804 km x 1.1 deg orbit drifting over
the Pacific.

A Nadezhda navigation/search and rescue satellite was launched from
Plesetsk on Jun 28. It was placed in a 684 x 708 km x 98.1 deg orbit,
the first ever sun-synchronous launch from the northern Plesetsk launch
site. Previous Nadezhdas went into 970 x 1000 km x 83 deg orbits.  The
Kosmos-3M rocket appears to have launched southbound into a suborbital
trajectory with an apogee of around 700 km.  A second stage 2 engine
burn around half an hour after launch circularized the orbit.

The Nadezhda satellite, built by AKO Polyot of Omsk, is an 800 kg
cylinder with a gravity gradient boom for stabilization and derives from
the Tsiklon navigation-communications satellite of the early 1970s,
which was the Soviet analog to the US Navy's Transit. The system was
developed by the NPO PM organization in Krasnoyarsk but later
transferred to Polyot.

The 11F617 Tsiklon satellite flew from 1967 to 1978. Its successor the
11F627 Tsiklon-B (or Parus) began flight tests in 1974 and is still in
service.  An advanced version used also for civilian navigation, the
11F643 Tsikada,  first flew in 1976. The 11F643N modification of
Tsikada, referred to as Nadezhda, made 3 flights from 1982 to 1984
carrying French-developed COSPAS search and rescue packages.These were
followed by the operational 17F118 Nadezhda satellites, of which six
have now been launched.


After Nadezhda was placed in orbit it ejected two subsatellites,
Tsinghua and SNAP-1, built by Surrey Satellite (SSTL) of England.
Tsinghua is owned by Tsinghua University of Beijing and carries imager
and communications payloads. The 50 kg, 0.69 x 0.36 x 0.36m box-shaped 
satellite is a standard SSTL microsat bus. Earlier SSTL microsats
deployed a 6-meter gravity gradient boom for stabilization; although
Tsinghua and its precursor UoSat-12 also carry such a boom, it isn't
deployed as these new satellites have momentum wheels for 3-axis
stabilization.

The SNAP-1 Surrey Nanosatellite Applications Platform is a 6 kg
satellite with imager and propulsion and will test rendezvous techniques
by formation flying with Tsinghua.

The first Advanced Tracking and Data Relay Satellite was launched on Jun
30 by International Launch Services for NASA-Goddard. TDRS H, to be
named TDRS 8 in orbit, is a Hughes HS-601 class comsat with a dry mass
of around 1600 kg.  It features an S-band phased array antenna and two
Ku/Ka band reflectors 4.6 meters in diameter. TDRS H was launched into a
subsynchronous transfer orbit of  237 x 27666 km x 27.0 deg by Lockheed
Martin's Atlas Centaur AC-139, a two-stage Atlas IIA variant. AC-139
took off from Space Launch Complex 36A at 1255 UTC on Jun 30, entered a
167 x 577 km x 28.3 deg parking orbit at 1305 UTC, and made the Centaur
second burn to transfer orbit at 1321 UTC. TDRS H carries a
Primex/Marquardt R4D liquid apogee engine which will be used for orbit
raising. The previous TDRS satellites were built by TRW and launched from
the Space Shuttle with the Boeing Inertial Upper Stage (IUS).

Another in the current busy round of Krunichev Proton launches was
completed successfully on Jun 30. Its payload was an Energiya Blok DM3
commercial upper stage and the Sirius CD Radio satellite Sirius 1. This
satellite is not to be confused with  Nordiska Satellit AB's Sirius 1,
an HS-376 satellite launched in 1989 as Marcopolo 1 but purchased and
renamed by NSAB in Dec 1993 (I wish satellite operators would use
original names, you can bet this will be an endless source of
confusion!)

The new Sirius 1 is a Digital Audio Radio Satellite, and will be used
for transmission of S-band radio broadcasts direct to receivers in cars
in the United States. Sirius 1 is a Loral LS-1300 class satellite; dry
mass is probably around 1500-1600 kg. The Sirius satellites are launched
to inclined elliptical orbits, and the Proton used a new launch profile.
The third stage entered a 170 km parking orbit inclined at 64.8 deg
(the usual comsat parking orbit has a 51.6 deg inclination but the 64.8
deg is also used by GLONASS navigation satellites). The first
DM burn was to an orbit of approximately 170 x 6200 km; the second
burn, 2 hours after launch, left Sirius 1 in a 6166 x 47110 km x 63.4 deg
orbit. Quoted final orbit is 24000 x 47000 km, so presumably the satellite
apogee engine will be used to raise perigee.

Errata
-------

I am reliably informed that the change of name of STEP 5 to TSX 5  was
not prompted by any chagrin over the program's record. The IR imager in
TSX-5's STRV-2 payload was developed by DERA at Farnborough, but the
rest of STRV-2 was built in the US.

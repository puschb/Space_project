Shuttle and Stations
--------------------

The STS-106 mission, Space Station logistics flight 2A.2b, is scheduled
for launch on Sep 8. It will dock with the International Space Station
and its crew will outfit the recently launched Zvezda module.

The press kit for the STS-106 mission is an improvement over recent
efforts; for the first time since the Boeing press kits were stopped,
it includes a decent payload bay diagram. (Admittedly the diagram
is actually for STS-101, but it's a step in the right direction).

STS-106 uses orbiter 104 (Atlantis), external tank ET-103, and solid
rocket motor pair RSRM-75. Engines 2052, 2044 and 2047 and OMS pods LP03
and RP04 are installed on Atlantis. Three EMU spacesuits are being
flown.

The payload bay manifest is:

The Integrated Cargo Carrier has the SOAR experiment for GPS
attitude control, and equipment for the spacewalks.
The adapter beam in bay 13 starboard carries two GAS canisters,
SEM-8 and G-782, both with high school experiments.

(If anyone has weight values for the tunnel adapter and tunnel,
please pass them along).

Crew of STS-106 are Terrence Wilcutt, Col USMC, NASA (Commander), Scott
Altman, Cmdr USN, NASA (Pilot),  Edward Lu, Ph.D., NASA (Mission
Specialist 1), Richard Mastracchio, NASA, (Mission Specialist 2), Daniel
Burbank, LtCmdr USCG, NASA (Mission Specialist 3), Yuri Malenchenko,
Col. VVS, RAKA (Mission Specialist 4), and Boris Morukov, M.D., IMBP
(Mission Specialist 5). Lu and Malenchenko will make a spacewalk from
Atlantis to connect cables between Zvezda and Zarya.

Current Launches
----------------

Russia launched a Globus military communications satellite on Aug 28 on
a Proton-K with a Blok DM-2 (or DM-2M?) upper stage. Globus satellites
are usually given the public name Raduga-1, but, possibly due to
administrative error, this satellite was initially named Kosmos-2372 by
the RVSN press service. I am assuming for the time being that Raduga-1
is the official name. The Globus satellites replaced the older Gran'
(Raduga) series.

Another International Launch Services Proton flight on Sep 5  placed
Sirius Radio's Sirius 2 in orbit. The Krunichev Proton-K was launched
from Baykonur into a low 144 x 168 km x 64.8 deg parking orbit. The
Energiya Blok DM3 stage then made two burns to deliver Sirius 2 to an
elliptical 6192 x 47057 km x 63.4 deg orbit. The satellite is a Space
Systems/Loral FS-1300 with a dry mass of 1570 kg and a launch mass of
3800 kg. Take care not to confuse this Sirius 2 with its namesake, the
geostationary Sirius 2 launched in Nov 1997 by Nordiska Satellit AB
which provides communications services to Scandinavia. Today's Sirius 2
will provide digital radio broadcasts to mobile users in North America.

The Solidaridad 1 communications satellite, a Hughes HS-601 owned by
Mexico, failed on Aug 27 when its backup computer died; the prime had
already failed. The satellite was launched in 1993.

The Zi Yuan 2 remote sensing satellite was launched on Sep 1 by a three
stage Chang Zheng 4B rocket from the Taiyuan Space Center in China. Zi
Yuan 1, launched in 1999, was the first China-Brasil Earth Resource Satellite
(CBERS), a joint project between the Chinese Academy of Space Technology
and the Brazilian space agency INPE; ZY-2 appears to be a purely 
Chinese mission, probably using the same bus. It is in a 474 x 493 km x 97.4
deg orbit, much lower than the ZY-1's 773 km orbit, which may indicate
a heavier payload.

The European Telecommunications Satellite Organization's Eutelsat W1
was launched on Sep 6 by Arianespace. The Ariane 44P, with four
solid strapons, put W1 in geostationary transfer orbit.

Eutelsat W1 will occupy the 10E orbital slot. The first Eutelsat W1
satellite, an Alcatel Spacebus 3000, was damaged in a fire in the Cannes
factory in 1998. Construction of a second Eutelsat "W1R", another
Spacebus 3000, was begun as well as a ground spare, called Ressat, built
by Matra Marconi Space/Toulouse (now part of the Astrium company) and
using a Eurostar 2000+ bus. The second Eutelsat W1 was reassigned to
become Eurobird, and will be launched to 28E, with Ressat becoming the
third and final Eutelsat W1. This satellite, the Eurostar 2000+, was the
one launched on Sep 6. Its mass is 1430 kg, with a further 1820 kg of
propellant at launch for its Primex R-4D liquid apogee engine. The
box-shaped 2.5 x 5.0 m satellite has two rectangular solar panel arrays
spanning 31.7m and two dishes, a European beam and a steerable beam. The
payload includes 28 Ku-band transponders.

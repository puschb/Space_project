Shuttle and Stations
--------------------

Atlantis docked to ISS Alpha on Feb 9. At 1500 UTC on Feb 10 Marsha
Ivins used the RMS arm to unberth the PMA-2 docking port from Unity. Tom
Jones and Bob Curbeam have begun the first spacewalk from the ODS
airlock on Atlantis, supervising the assembly operations. The airlock
was depressurized at 1544 UTC; the hatch was opened at 1546 UTC and the
astronauts went to suit battery power at 1550 UTC. PMA-2 was berthed on
Z1 at 1650 UTC; Destiny was unberthed from the payload bay at 1735 UTC
and docked to Unity at 1900 UTC.  At 1935 UTC Curbeam was connecting
ammonia coolant lines when a leaking connector sprayed ammonia into
space, contaminating his suit. He was ordered to stay in sunlight to
bake off the ammonia. At around 2311 UTC the spacewalkers returned to
the airlock, closing the hatch at 2318 UTC. Repressurization began at
2324 UTC, for a duration of 7h40m (depress), 7h34m (NASA), or 7h32m
(hatch open/close). 

The airlock reached 5psi (34 kPa) at 2326 UTC and was held there, with
the astronauts still in suits. A new depressurization for
decontamination was begun at 2342 UTC, with the airlock fully
depressurized at 2350 UTC. The hatch was then opened and closed quickly
at 2351-2352 UTC, to flush the airlock of any ammonia residue, and
repressurization began anew at 2353 UTC, reaching 5psi again prior to
2357 UTC. This new spacewalk lasted 3 minutes (depress), or 1 minute
(hatch open/close); it was not counted as an EVA by NASA.

EVA-2 began at 1555 UTC on Feb 12 with depressurization of the airlock.
The astronauts went to battery power at 1559 UTC. The PMA-2 docking port
was attached to Destiny at 1728 UTC. The Power Data Grapple Fixture
(PDGF) was removed from its location on an adaptive payload carrier on
the port side of the payload bay (probably bay 5P) and installed on
Destiny. The PDGF will be used by the Station's robot arm, and is an
improved grapple fixture with electrical power and data ports. The hatch
was closed at 2240 UTC and the  airlock was repressurized at 2249 UTC.
Duration was 6h54m (depress), about 6h50m (hatch open/close), or
6h50m (NASA rule).


The third official EVA was on Feb 14. The airlock was depressurized at
1443 UTC, with hatch open at around 1445 and battery power at 1448. The
spare SASA S-band antenna was unberthed from an adapter beam in the
payload bay  (around bay 4P?) and installed on Z1. The +X (starboard)
TCS radiator on P6, launched on the previous mission, was deployed at
1649 UTC. The astronauts completed the spacewalk with repressurization
of the airlock at 2013 UTC. Time was 5h30m (depress), about 5h24m (hatch
open/close), or 5h25m (NASA).

Atlantis undocked from Alpha at 1406 UTC on Feb 16.
Landing was waved off on Feb 18 and is expected on Feb 19.

Destiny has been cataloged by US Space Command as 2001-06B (SSN 26700).
Unity was also given a catalog number, but for some reason Z1 and P6
were not. 

At the end of the docked phase, Atlantis mass is 95242 kg and
the Station mass is 104401 kg for a total mass of 199643 kg.

Discovery was rolled out to pad LC39B on Feb 12 in preparation for
the next flight,  STS-102.

On Feb 12, the Mir complex was in a 272 x 293 km orbit.
Reentry is expected in mid-March.

NEAR-Shoemaker at Eros
----------------------

The NEAR-Shoemaker probe has completed its descent to the surface of 
minor planet (433) Eros. The deorbit burn, at an altitude of 26 km above
the surface, was at 1515 UTC into a 7.5 km x 35 km orbit relative to
Eros center, with periapsis below the surface. Touchdown was at 1944:35
UTC at location 35S 279W. Signals continued to be received from NEAR
hours after the landing, confirming that it survived the 2m/s impact.

Readers should note that APL has been reporting times of radio signal
receipt as if they were the actual times that the events occurred, and
most media reports, even Spaceflightnow.com and the New York Times, have
propagated this error.  Light travel time from Eros at the time of
landing was 17 minutes 35 seconds, so the touchdown signal was received
on Earth at 2002:10 UTC, and this has been incorrectly reported as the
actual landing time.

NEAR-Shoemaker was built and operated by Johns Hopkins University's
Applied Physics Lab (APL). It was the first launch in NASA's Discovery
Program, on 1996 Feb 17 by a Delta 7925 from Cape Canaveral. After a
13-minute stay in a 185 km parking orbit around the Earth, NEAR was
boosted to a 0.99 x 2.18 AU x 0.8 deg orbit around the Sun. Following a
1200 km flyby of (253) Mathilde on 1997 Jun 27, a burn on 1997 Jul 3 put
NEAR in a 0.95 x 2.18 AU x 0.5 deg orbit on track for an Earth flyby 532
km over Iran on 1998 Jan 23. This lowered the orbit to 0.99 x 1.77 AU
and increased ecliptic inclination to 10 degrees. NEAR flew past (433)
Eros on 1998 Dec 23, after an aborted rendezvous burn. A new burn put
NEAR in a 1.13 x 1.78AU orbit and set it up for a second Eros approach
on 2000 Feb 14, with insertion into a 321 x 366 km polar orbit, soon
reduced to 100 x 100 km and later to 35 km. Later in 2000 the orbital
inclination around Eros was increased to 130 deg, and finally in Dec
2000 to 179 deg. NEAR spent one year in Eros orbit prior to this week's
final descent. Below I list the Discovery program missions.

Errata
-------

Skynet 4F belongs to the UK Ministry of Defence, not the (non-existent)
Ministry of Defense.

SICRAL actually stands for   Satellite Italiano per Comunicazioni
Riservate e ALlarmi (Italian Satellite for Restricted Communications and
Warnings) and its manufacturer is now called Alenia Spazio. Apparently
FiatAvio makes the biprop engine, I haven't found any details on it yet.

Dry mass for the Telecom 1 satellites was actually more like 560 kg.
Thanks to J-P. Donnio for the correction.

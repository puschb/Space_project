Shuttle and Station
--------------------

The STS-104 mission continued with spacewalks to stick gas tanks on the
outside of the new Quest airlock, the first spacewalk from that airlock,
and then undocking and landing. The Expedition 2 crew (Usachyov, Voss
and Helms) remain on board Station until their replacements arrive next
month on STS-105.

The second STS-104 spacewalk was carried out on Jul 18. The airlock was
depressurized at 0302 UTC and the hatch opened a minute later. Gernhardt
and Reilly emerged at 0310 UTC and assisted in the installation of the
oxygen and nitrogen tanks on the Quest module. O2 Tank 1, on the port
side of the aft Spacelab pallet, was grappled by the Station's SSRMS arm
at 0317 UTC and installed on Quest's nadir by 0421 UTC. N2 Tank 4, on
the aft pallet's starboard side, was installed by 0639 UTC and O2 Tank 2
was moved from the port side of the forward pallet to Quest by 0845 UTC.
Minor problems with valve configurations and recalcitrant connectors
were soon overcome. The astronauts entered the airlock at 0921 UTC. The
spacewalk lasted 6h31m (depress/repress), 6h24m (hatch open/close), or
6h29m (NASA rule).


The same astronauts made the first spacewalk from the Quest module on
Jul 21. The airlock depressurized slowly from 0329 UTC  to 0434 UTC,
when it reached 35 mbar and the airlock hatch was opened to vacuum. The
N2 Tank 3 was transferred from the forward Spacelab pallet to the
exterior of Quest, following which the astronauts climbed the P6 tower
to inspect the solar arrays and the FPP experiment. The hatch was closed
at 0832 UTC with repress at 0837 UTC for a duration of 4h03m (dp/rp),
3h58m (hatch open/close), or 4h02m (NASA rule).

The STS-104 crew returned to Atlantis on Jul 22, and undocked at 0455
UTC. After flying around the station they departed the vicinity at 0615
UTC. Atlantis landed at 0338:55 UTC on Jul 25, touching down at Kennedy
Space Center runway 15.


Recent Launches
---------------

The Russian Navy launched a three-stage R-29R Volna from a submarine,
the Borisoglebsk, in the Barents Sea on Jul 20, on a suborbital flight.
The payload was a joint project between the Planetary Society and NPO
Lavochkin's Babakin center, and consisted of a solar sail deployment
test with an inflatable reentry shield. The payload failed to separate
from the final stage.

The Russian Space Forces launched a TsSKB-Progress 8K78M Molniya-M
rocket on Jul 20 from Plesetsk, placing a Molniya-1K military comsat in
12-hour elliptical orbit. The last launch of a Molniya-1T was in 1998;
the new satellite is an improved model (Russian sources via Phil Clark;
other sources are calling this a Molniya-3, and I am waiting for
confirmation). The Molniya-M third stage reached a 214 x 420 km x 62.8
deg orbit at 0026 UTC. At around 0110 UTC, about half an orbit later
over the SE Pacific, the NPO Lavochkin Blok-ML fourth stage fired to put
the payload in a 407 x 40831 km x 62.9 deg orbit. The Molniya satellites
are built by NPO-PM.

International Launch Services launched a Lockheed Martin Atlas IIA from
Cape Canaveral on Jul 23 carrying the GOES-M weather satellite. Flight
AC-142 entered a 164 x 505 km parking orbit and then a supersynchronous
transfer orbit of 274 x 42275 km x 20 deg. GOES-M is a Loral 1300-series
satellite with a single solar array and a solar attitude control sail.
Launch mass was 2279 kg and dry mass is 1042 kg. The Geostationary
Operational Environmental Satellites are developed by NASA-Goddard and
transferred to the NOAA weather agency when operational. In addition to
the usual weather imager/sounder, GOES-M carries a new solar soft X-ray
imager. Earlier GOES satellites carried simple X-ray collimator
detectors, but the new SXI is a full-fledged grazing incidence telescope
similar to the SXT on Japan's Yohkoh satellite. The GOES-M satellite
becomes GOES 12 now that it is on orbit.

On Jul 22 the MAP probe was in a 4055 x 355935 km x 28.0 deg orbit,
scheduled for a Jul 31 lunar flyby.

Vladimir Solov'yov and Aleksandr Balandin made another spacewalk
on Jul 26 to complete the Soyuz TM-9 repair and close the 
Kvant-2 EVA hatch. The EVA appears to have been successful.
Soyuz TM-10 was launched Aug 1 with crew Gennadiy Manakov
(Komandir) and Gennadiy Strekalov (Bortinzhener). The TM-9 crew 
will land Aug 9; the TM-10 crew will stay up until December.

Arianespace successfully launched an Ariane IV on Jul 24.  The two
payloads heading for geostationary orbit are TDF 2 and Kopernikus DFS 2,
both television direct broadcasting satellites.  The first is for the
French TV channel Telediffusion de France, and the second is for the
Deutsche Bundespost (DFS stands for Deutsche FernsehenSatellit, German
for German TV Satellite). 

The DoD/NASA CRRES (Combined Release and Radiation Effects Satellite)
was launched into elliptical orbit on Jul 25 by the first commercial
Atlas I Centaur.  The satellite carries experiments to study the
magnetosphere and ionosphere, and will also carry out chemical releases
to allow visual observations of the Earth's magnetic field.  (Ions
released into the field glow pretty colors as they move along the field
lines). Congratulations Nick, I hope you get good data.

A Resurs-F remote sensing satellite was launched on Jul 17.

Kosmos-2085, launched on Jul 18, is a geostationary comsat.

Kosmos-2086, launched on Jul 20, is a polar recon satellite.

Kosmos-2087, launched on Jul 25, is an early warning satellite.

Orbital Verification of the HST continues.  Software errors continue to
be found; controllers have been playing with the secondary mirror and
have been using the off-axis FOC camera to study the image quality. 
Instrument testing continues; there are a few problems but nothing too
major yet.  The HST science institute (STScI) logo used to be a graphic
of rays coming to a focus.  In the revised version spotted recently on
STScI office doors, the rays come to two different foci and the motto
below is "ABERRARE HUMANUM EST".

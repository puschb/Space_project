Shuttle and Station
--------------------

The Expedition 3 crew continues work on the Station. The Progress M-SO1
vehicle undocked from the Pirs module at 1536 UTC  on Sep 26 and was
deorbited over the Pacific at 2330 UTC the same day. This leaves the
Pirs docking port free for dockings.

Upcoming Shuttle flights are likely to be delayed because of recently
discovered damage to mounting points on the OMS pods in several
orbiters.

The daily Shuttle processing reports from KSC are now suppressing
information about which orbiter is in which OPF bay at the request of
security officials. While I'm in agreement with the need for increased
security at NASA bases - access control can be pretty lax sometimes -
this, like so many recent so-called security measures, seems to fall in
the 'really silly' category.


Recent Launches
---------------

The first orbital launch from Alaska's Kodiak Island took place on 2001
Sep 30. The Lockheed Martin Athena-1 (serial LM-001) took off
from the Kodiak Launch Complex at 0240 UTC. The Castor 120 first stage
and Orbus 21 second stage fired and separated, followed at 0245 UTC by
the first burn of the Orbit Adjust Module (OAM). The OAM uses four
MR-107 hydrazine engines which fired for 12 min to put the payload in a
237 x 815 km transfer orbit. After coast to apogee above East Africa, a
second burn at around 0337 UTC circularized the orbit. USAF Space Test
Program satellites Picosat, Sapphire and PCSat were deployed into an 790
x 800 km x 67 deg orbit between 0344 and 0352 UTC; the OAM then made a
perigee lowering burn, probably about 0355 UTC, to a 470 x 800 km orbit.
Another burn half an orbit later put OAM in a 467 x 474 km orbit. The
Starshine-3 was deployed around 0450 UTC; it is a 90 kg, 0.9m geodetic
sphere that will be observed by school students. The project is managed
by NASA GSFC and Starshine was built by NRL.  Finally, the OAM made a
perigee-lowering depletion burn which left in in a 215 x 403 km x 67.2
deg orbit from which it should reenter in a few months. STP P97-1
Picosat (incorrectly called Picosat 9 by Space Command) was built by
Surrey Satellite for the USAF using a Uosat-type bus; the 68 kg
satellite carries a polymer battery experiment and ionospheric
instruments. PCSat is a UHF/VHF amateur radio satellite built by US
Naval Academy students at Annapolis; mass is probably of order 10 kg.
SAPPHIRE was built by Stanford University students and carries
experimental infrared horizon sensors, a voice synthesizer and a digital
camera. The satellite is about 0.5m in size and has a mass of 16 kg.

The MAP satellite has now arrived at the vicinity of the Earth-Sun L2
point, although I have been unable to obtain detailed trajectory
information.

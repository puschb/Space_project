Shuttle and Station
--------------------

The sojourn of Expedition 3 - Culbertson, Dezhurov, and Tyurin - is
drawing to a close aboard the International Space Station. The
Expedition 4 crew of Yuriy Onufrikeno (Commander) and Daniel Bursch and
Carl Walz (Flight Engineers) is preparing to ride to Station aboard
Endeavour to replace them. The crew of mission STS-108 consists of Dom
Gorie (Commander), Mark E. Kelley (Pilot), Linda Godwin and Dan Tani
(Mission Specialists). STS-108 will fly the UF-1 Utilization Flight
mission, distinguished from earlier Station flights which were
considered assembly flights. In addition to the crew swap, UF-1 will
bring supplies to the Station, and Godwin and Tani will do a spacewalk
to add thermal blankets to the gimbals on the Station's solar arrays.

In the cargo bay is the Raffaello (MPLM-2) logistics module with 4 RSP
and 8 RSR resupply racks. Earlier, the MELFI freezer had been scheduled
for this flight, but it isn't mentioned in the press kit. Also in the
cargo bay are the MACH-1 and LMC experiment trusses flown under the
Goddard small payloads program. MACH-1 is an MPESS-type Hitchhiker
bridge carrying the CAPL-3 capillary thermal control experiment on top.
On its forward side is the Starshine-2 launch canister, the CAPL-3
avionics plate, the Hitchhiker avionics plate, and the SEM-15 canister.
On the aft side is the G-761 canister containing experiments from
Argentina, the PSRD synchrotron detector (a prototype for the AMS
antimatter experiment which will fly on Station later), the COLLIDE-2
and SEM-11 canisters. The SEM (Space Experiment Modules) are collections
of high school experiments.

LMC, the Lightweight MPESS Carrier (a nested acronym in the grand NASA
tradition) is a new cargo bay bridge - it is actually LMC S/N 2,
presumably S/N 1 was a ground test article - and carries four canisters
with materials science and technology experiments: SEM-12, G-785, G-064
and G-730. In addition, an adapter beam on the starboard sidewall carries
G-221 and G-775, with materials science and biology experiments.

A Progress robot cargo supply ship was launched on Nov 26. The vehicle
is Progress M1-7 (vehicle No. 256). Launch was by the uprated Soyuz-FG
rocket (a Soyuz-U with improved core packet engines). The Progress M-45
undocked from Zvezda's rear port on Nov 22 and was deorbited over the
Pacific later the same day.

Progress M1-7 docked with Zvezda on Nov 28. However, following `soft
dock' (initial capture), it appears that `hard dock' (firm latching) was
not completed, raising fears that  torques associated with next week's
planned Shuttle docking could break the vehicle loose. The Russian Space
Agency is continuing to evaluate the situation.

Recent Launches
---------------

The DirecTV-4S television broadcasting satellite was launched on Nov 27.
The Arianespace Ariane 44LP put the Boeing 601HP satellite in
geostationary transfer orbit. The satellite has a dry mass of 2100 kg
and a launch mass of 4300 kg.
DirecTV Inc. is currently owned by Hughes Electronics,
but a takeover by Echostar is in the works.

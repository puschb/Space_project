Shuttle and Station
--------------------

In the course of 4 spacewalks the STS-110 crew added the S0 truss to the
Station. On Apr 11 at 1030 UTC the S0 truss was unberthed from Atlantis,
and berthed to the Destiny module's Lab Cradle Assembly at 1346 UTC. At
1433 the Quest airlock was depressurized and Smith and Walheim emerged
to bolt in place the two forward MTS struts and deploy a trailing
umbilical for the mobile transporter. The airlock was repressurized at
2224 UTC.

The second spacewalk was from 1405 to 2139 UTC on Apr 13; Ross and Morin
attached the aft MTS struts and deployed the second trailing umbilical.
On Apr 14 from 1344 to 2015 UTC Smith and Walheim made the third EVA and
rewired the SSRMS station robot arm to get power via S0; they also
removed launch restraint bolts from the Mobile Transporter. On Apr 16
from about 1426 UTC to 2106 UTC the airlock was again depressurized, and
Ross and Morin deployed the Airlock Spur, a small ladder from S0 to
Quest, as well as installing some floodlights. The Mobile Transporter
was tested in a small move on Apr 15.

Atlantis undocked from ISS at 1831 UTC on Apr 17 and returned to
Earth on Apr 19, with a deorbit burn at 1518:59 UTC and landing
on runway 33 at KSC at 1626:57 UTC.

At 0916 UTC on Apr 20 Soyuz TM-33 undocked from the Zarya nadir port
carrying the Expedition-4 crew. It redocked with the Pirs nadir port at
0937 UTC.  Soyuz TM-34 (spacecraft No. 208) was launched on Apr 25.
Commander is Yuri Gidzenko of Rosaviakosmos, flight engineer is Roberto
Vittori of ESA. Tourist Mark Shuttleworth, a South African citizen, is
also aboard as 'uchastnik poleta', or 'flight participant'. The 4S
flight will dock at the Zarya nadir port and  the crew will return to
Earth in the old TM-33 vehicle, leaving TM-34 as the active rescue
vehicle. At 1210 UTC Soyuz TM-34 was in a 242 x 269 km x 51.6 deg orbit.

The next Shuttle mission is STS-111, scheduled for late May.


Recent Launches
---------------

Arianespace launched Ariane mission V150, an Ariane 44L, on Apr 16. The
Lockheed Martin A2100 class NSS 7 satellite was put in orbit; the
satellite is owned by New Skies, an Intelsat spinoff, and carries a C/Ku
band telecoms payload. The spacecraft was in a 24200 x 35706 km x 0.7
deg orbit by Apr 24, on its way to GEO.

Space Command has now cataloged the Kosmos-2388 satellite in a 519 x
39178 km x 62.93 deg orbit, over two weeks after its launch.
As of Apr 22, TDRS I was still in an 8391 x 35806 km transfer orbit
with no new orbit changes since late March.

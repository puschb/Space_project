Major new online resource: Launch Vehicle Database
----------------------------------------------------

After several years of preparation, the initial release of the 

<A HREF="http://hea-www.harvard.edu/~jcm/space/lvdb">JSR Launch Vehicle Database</A>

is now online (please excuse the raw HTML if you see it on the line above!)

The database (it's just a set of text files, not a database in the
modern sense) contains basic details of about 30000 rocket launches and
aims to contain all known orbital and suborbital space launches (apogees
more than 80 km) as well as a number of lower apogee rocket launches
deemed to be of interest. Corrections and additions are, as always,
welcome; I expect to update the files every few months.

I strongly refute the suggestion by one early visitor to this resource
that I have `way too much time on my hands'. Nevertheless, I believe
this to be the first reasonably comprehensive compilation of suborbital
space launches either online or in print, although Joe King, Keith
Scala, Gunter Krebs (www.skyrocket.de), Jean-Jacques Serra
(http://www.univ-perp.fr/fuseurop), Joel Powell, Carl Rigg and Pete
Alway (http://members.aol.com/satrnpress/saturn.htm), among others, also
have extensive lists and made important contributions.


Shuttle and Station
--------------------

Orbiter OV-105 Endeavour was launched at 2122:49 UTC on 2002 Jun 5.
At 2131 UTC it reached a 58 x 224 km x 51.6 deg orbit (as quoted
by the NASA PAO) and separated from the External Tank. It coasted
to apogee at 2201 UTC and carried out the OMS-2 burn to raise the 
orbit to 158 x 235 km.

Endeavour is flying Shuttle mission STS-111, Station mission UF-2, to
deliver the Expedition 5 crew to the Station and return the  Ex-4 crew.

Erratum
-------

In earlier JSRs I reported the Mar 21 launch of Progress M1-8 as being
with the new Soyuz-FG launch vehicle, based on Russian reports. The
latest issue of Novosti Kosmonavtiki magazine makes it clear that M1-8
actually used the older Soyuz-U, 11A511U No. 678. Thus, the only
Soyuz-FG launches to date have been Progress M1-6 and M1-7.
The -FG is very similar to the -U, with some uprated engines.

Recent Launches
---------------

Kosmos-2389 was launched from Plesetsk on May 28 at roughly its
scheduled time of 1815 UTC. It is a Parus-class navigation satellite.
The Kosmos-3M rocket entered a transfer orbit of about 150 x 1000 km x
83 deg at about 1823 UTC; a second burn at apogee around 1905 UTC
circularized the orbit at 950 x 1016 km. The satellite is in Plane 4,
probably replacing Kosmos-2336; it is between the planes of Kosmos-2366
and Kosmos-2361.

I was a little confused earlier by the objects in the recent Chinese
launch. Mike McCants reports that 2002-24B, in the 851 x 873 km orbit,
is the FY-1D weather satellite, and the object that maneuvered to the
lower 792 km orbit is the HY-1 oceanography research satellite which is
confirmed to have orbit adjust capability by Chinese sources.

I am informed that 
 FY-1D = Feng Yun Yi Ding
 HY-1  = Hai Yang Yi
(Yi is 1, Ding is used as an equivalent of D, with A = Jia, B = Yi, C = Beng -
recall that there's no alphabet per se in Chinese!).
Feng Yun means 'Wind and Cloud', Hai Yang means 'Ocean'.

Intelsat 905 was launched on Jun 5 into geostationary transfer orbit by
an Arianespace Ariane 44L. The satellite has a mass of 1984 kg with 2739
kg of propellant and was built by Loral for the recently privatized
Intelsat company. It will be stationed over the Atlantic.

----------------------------------------------------

Manakov and Strekalov continue in orbit aboard the Mir complex. 
Progress M-4 will remain docked at the forward port until it is replaced
by M-5 in September. 

A Soviet Resurs-F2 remote sensing satellite was launched into polar
orbit on Aug 16, replacing one which landed the same day after a month
in orbit. 

STS-35/Columbia is targeted for launch Sep 1 with the Astro-1/BBXRT
payload.  Discovery has been mated with the STS-41 stack and will be
rolled out to LC39B in a few days for the Ulysses mission. 

Yuri-3A, a television broadcasting satellite, was launched
by the Japanese NASDA space agency on Aug 28, aboard an H-I rocket.

Kosmos-2097 was launched by Molniya on Aug 29; it is probably
an early warning satellite.

Kosmos-2098 was launched by Kosmos on Aug 29; I don't
know what its orbit or mission are yet, or that of Kosmos-2096.

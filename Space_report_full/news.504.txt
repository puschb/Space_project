Shuttle and Station
--------------------

The Expedition 7 crew, Yuriy Malenchenko and Edward Lu, are on board the
Space Station. 

In a dramatic test in Texas on July 7, foam shot at RCC panel 8 in a
Shuttle wing mockup smashed a huge (half-meter) hole in the panel,
lending strong credibility to the hypothesis that external tank foam
caused a breach in Columbia's wing during launch. The actual breach was
more likely only of order 0.2m. The most likely scenario for the breakup
can now be summarized (below); the remarkable thing is the continued
stable flight of Columbia for several minutes after serious breaches in
the left wing.

Recent Launches
---------------

NASA's second Mars Exploration Rover, MER-B (MER-1) 'Opportunity', was
launched from Cape Canaveral at 0318 UTC on Jul 8. The launch vehicle is
a Delta 7925H, which is similar to the standard 7925 model but with
larger GEM-46 solid strapon motors previously used only on the Delta III
8930.  MER-B separated from the Delta third stage at 0436 UTC and is on
its way to Mars.

Eurockot and Krunichev have launched a Rokot vehicle from Plesetsk
carrying nine small satellites. The two stages of the UR-100N missile
separated from the Briz-KM stage at 5 min after launch. The first
Briz-KM burn lasted 8.2 minutes and resulted in an approximately -200 x
320 km x 96.8 deg suborbital transfer ellipse. Briz burnt again at 44
min after launch and entered a 317 x 846 km x 96.8 deg orbit. The Czech
MIMOSA satellite then separated at 1502 UTC.

A third Briz-KM burn at 1541 UTC resulted in an 817 x 830 km x 98.7 deg
circular orbit. At 1542 UTC the NLS-1 nanosatellite launcher attached to
Briz  ejected three small 1 kg Cubesats, Can X-1, DTUSat and
AAU-Cubesat. Almost simultaneously, the NLS-2 launcher ejected Quakesat,
a 3 kg satellite based on a triple-Cubesat design. At 1546 UTC the 60 kg
Canadian MOST astronomical satellite was ejected, and a minute later two
more 1 kg Cubesats, Cubesat XI-IV and CUTE-I, separated from Briz. At
1556 UTC Briz-KM made a depletion burn to lower its orbit to 250 x 830
km x 98.4 deg. The largest payload is Krunichev's Monitor-E mockup,
which remains attached to the Briz-KM stage, and is cataloged as
2003-31A. MIMOSA is 2003-31B, MOST is 2003-31D, and Quakesat is
2003-31F; XI-IV is very probably 2003-31J. The NLS-1 payloads are 31C,
31G and 31H but their actual orbits  and respective identifications are
not clear yet; DTUSat and AAU-Cubesat are not yet in communication with
their owners due to ground station problems.


Mimosa is a 65 kg polyhedron built by Space Devices Ltd. of Praha, and
operated by the Astronomical Insitute of the Czech Academy of Sciences
(Astronomicky ustav AV CR). It carries an accelerometer to study
atmospheric density. MOST (Microvariability and Oscillations of Stars)
is a Canadian Space Agency project with a 0.15m telescope which will
make photometric observations of stars  down to mag 6 with 1 part per
million accuracy in the 3500-7000 Angstrom band.

The Stanford University/Quakesat LLC  Quakesat will be used for
detection of ELF radio emission from seismic activity. CanX-1, from the
University of Toronto, carries a camera for attitude determination.
CUTE-I carries engineering tests and was built by the Tokyo Inst. of
Technology (Tokyo Kogyo Daigaku);  Cubesat XI is similar and is from the
University of Tokyo (Tokyo Daigaku).  Two Danish Cubesats are AAU
Cubesat from Aalborg Universitet (University of Aalborg) and DTUSat from
 Danmarks Tekniske Universitet (Technical University of Denmark), at
Lyngby. DTUSat carries a 450-meter copper wire tether for lowering the
satellite orbit. AAU Cubesat carries a 100-meter-resolution Earth
imaging camera.

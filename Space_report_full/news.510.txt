Shuttle and Station
--------------------

Jim Oberg reports that the new plan for Shuttle flights includes a
stripped-down ISS ULF-1 mission, with added on-orbit tile inspection and
repair tests, to fly on STS-114 next summer (no earlier than Jul 15),
followed by a new ISS ULF-1.1 mission to complete the original
objectives and perform extra tests; this new mission will be STS-121.

Recent Launches
---------------

The Galileo Orbiter spacecraft entered the Jovian atmosphere on Sep 21
at 1857 UTC. Entry was at 48.2 km/s from an orbit with a periapsis 9700
km below the 1-bar atmospheric layer (used by convention as the nominal
'surface' of Jupiter). The spacecraft continued transmitting at least
until it passed behind the limb of Jupiter at 1850:54 UTC, at which point
it was 9283 km above the 1-bar level, surprising Galileo veterans who
feared it might enter safemode due to the high radiation environment. It
crossed the orbit of Callisto at around 1100 UTC on Sep 20, the orbit of
Ganymede at around 0500 UTC on Sep 21, Europa's orbit at about 1145 UTC,
Io's orbit at about 1500 UTC, Amalthea's orbit at 1756 UTC, and the
orbits of Adrastea and Metis at 1825 UTC. No close approaches were made
to any of the moons during this final suicide dive. Galileo was destroyed
to prevent the possibility that its orbit would eventually be perturbed
in such a way that it would crash on and biologically contaminate Europa,
which is considered a possible place to search for life. Light travel
time from Jupiter to Earth was 52 min 20 sec at the time of impact,
and the final signal reached Earth at 1943:14 UTC.

Chinese space analyst Chen Lan passes on a report from
china-spacenews.com that the Chinese solid-fuel launch vehicle KT-1 was
launched on Sep 16, one year after the first KT-1 launch failure. The
official release claims the  new launch as a test flight which was
successful overall, including satellite/launch vehicle separation, but
did not achieve all objectives. Since Space Command have not cataloged
any new orbiting objects, it seems fair to infer that one of the
secondary objectives not achieved was orbit insertion, and I am
including this launch as a failed orbital attempt. Since the report
implies any failure came late in the process and states that guidance
was successful, I speculate wildly that fourth stage propulsion is the
most likely source of the failure. As far as I know, the exact launch
time has not been released.

 Mr. Chen also reports from other sources that the launch was intended
to place a 40 kg microsatellite called PS2 into a 300 x 300 km polar
orbit. According to him, the CASIC (China Aerospace Science and Industry
Corp) is privately developing the KT-1 rocket, and leads two consortia
ASLVC (Aerospace Solid Launch Vehicle Corp) and  Harbin Fenghua
Aerospace acting as prime contractor and launch provider.

A Polyot Kosmos-3M rocket was launched from Russia's Plesetsk spaceport
on Sep 27. It placed into orbit a cluster of seven satellites:

 - STSat-1 (or KAISTSAT-4), a Korean satellite which carries an
   extreme ultraviolet telescope built by UC Berkeley;
 - Three satellites built by Surrey Satellite for the Disaster Monitoring
   Constellation: UK-DMC for the British National Space Center, 
   NigeriaSat-1 for the National Space Research and Development Agency
   of Nigeria, and BILSAT-1 for TUBITAK-ODTU-BILTEN, the Information
   Tech and Electronics Research Institute of Middle East Technical University
   in Ankara, Turkey;
 - Mozhaets-4, a modified NPO-PM Strela-1M satellite carrying experiments
   built by students at the Mozhaiskiy space engineering academy.
 - Larets, a small Russian satellite about which very little is known. A TASS
   report (pointed out to me by spaceflightnow.com's Justin Ray)
   claimed it is for radar calibration.
 - Rubin-4-DSI, an instrument package attached to the Kosmos-3M final
   stage to measure the launch environment. The Rubin packages are built
   by OHB System of Bremen, the European partner in the commercialization
   of the Kosmos-3M rocket, 
The satellites were placed in a 674 x 696 km x 98.2 deg sun-synchronous orbit.
They have been cataloged as objects 2003-42A to 42G, but it isn't clear
yet which is which.

An additional object was cataloged by Space Command as SSN 27947
(2003-42J) and then reported by them as having "decayed" from this
fairly high orbit the following day; I believe this is a bureaucratic
way of dealing with the fact that they messed up and had a duplicate
entry for one of the other satellites in the launch, since their
software doesn't have a way of saying 'this is a mistake and we deleted
it'. This sort of thing is not uncommon when trying to sort out the
radar data from a cluster of closely spaced small objects.

Arianespace launched an Ariane 5G rocket, vehicle 516, from Kourou on
Sep 27. It carried three payloads - Insat 3E, e-Bird, and SMART-1. 
SMART-1 is a European Space Agency satellite which will use ion drive to
reach lunar orbit; it was built by the Swedish Space Corp. Insat 3E is
an Indian communications satellite, while e-Bird is a Boeing BSS 376
class satellite owned by Eutelsat, and will provide data transmission in
Europe. The Ariane EPC core stage reached a 55 x 1512 km x 7.0 deg orbit
and reentered at around 0100 UTC, The EPS upper stage placed the
payloads in a 670 x 35830 km x 6.9 deg geostationary transfer orbit. 
 
The Telstar 4 (former Telstar 402R) satellite suffered a power failure
on Sep 19 and appears to be a total loss. Telstar 402R was launched on
1995 Sep 24 on Ariane flight V78. It was part of AT&T's satellite
fleet, later sold to Loral Skynet and now in the process of being
sold to Intelsat.

Telstar 402R had replaced the Telstar 402 satellite which exploded
shortly after launch in Sep 1994. Only one object was cataloged, and
that object (SSN 23249) is designated Telstar 402 by Space Command,
implying that the Ariane third stage did not remain in orbit. Anyone who
can confirm that the third stage from that flight reentered on its first
orbit is invited to contact me.

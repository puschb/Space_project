 SPIRIT ON MARS
 --------------

The landing of MER-A "Spirit" near Gusev crater on Mars occurred around
0426 UTC on 2004 Jan 4.

The cruise stage separated at 0405 UTC and the spacecraft  entered the
Martian atmosphere at 0420 UTC at 5.4 km/s. (for comparison, Martian
escape velocity at this altitude is around 4.93 km/s). Intended entry
angle was 11.5 degrees, which would give a vacuum periapsis around 7 km
above the surface, but controllers reported the entry was slightly
shallow.
By 0425 UTC the parachute was deployed; 20 seconds later the heatshield
was jettisoned. Next the backshell (attached to the parachute) separated
from the lander attached to a cable. About a hundred metres up, the
airbags inflated, the retrorockets fired to stop the descent, and the
parachute-backshell system was jettisoned. The airbag-enclosed lander
hit the surface at around 0426 UTC and bounced multiple times, with the
signal detected on Earth at 0436 UTC and then cutting off. Signal was
reacquired at 0452 UTC (corresponding to a signal sent at 0443 UTC by
the lander) confirmed that the landing was complete and the lander was
the correct way up. Next steps were airbag deflation, petal opening and
solar array deploy. The first images from the surface were received at
JPL at 0730 UTC, and the rover rolled off the lander onto the surface
on Jan 15.

Light time from Mars to Earth at the time of landing was 9 min 28s.

Cancellation of HST SM4  (Warning: editorial content slipping in here)
------------------------

NASA has cancelled the final servicing mission to the Hubble Space
Telescope. This is a blow to astronomy, as two expensive new instruments
had been completed and are ready to fly. HST will continue to operate
for a while, but plans are to deorbit it before its systems fail -
probably by 2007. This will leave a big gap in US astronomical
capabilities, and is sure to be a blow to morale at the Space Telescope
Science Institute (and the NASA/Goddard program office) who have provided
us with all those stunning images of deep space.

NASA HQ claims that the cancellation is because the Shuttle cannot fly
safely to this one remaining mission not involving the Station without
undue safety risk. However, other sources suggest that Shuttle program
experts were willing to support such a mission. Many  astronomers I have
spoken to are skeptical, suggesting that at least part of the reason is
to free up funding for the human spaceflight exploration program, and
that Congress will find it much harder to fight this decision if it is
presented as for safety rather than budgetary reasons. The really big
question is how other space science programs will fare in the upcoming
budget; if the previously allocated SM4 funding is redirected to programs
that can provide a replacement optical and UV astronomy capability
(perhaps competing against other disciplines), things are not so bad;
but if it and other space science program funding is redirected to the 
(however worthy) human exploration program, it could be a major setback
to our exploration of the wider universe. Stay tuned...

Bush Space Proposals
--------------------
Here are some details of the proposals in President Bush's speech at
NASA on Jan 14.

 - Robot lunar missions would begin in 2008
 - The new CEV (Crew Exploration Vehicle) would begin (robotic?)
   testing in 2008
 - ISS assembly would be complete by 2010  
 - The Shuttle would be retired in 2010  
 - The CEV would enter (crewed) service in 2014  as a Station ferry. 
   In the intervening 4 years, 
   non-US vehicles such as Soyuz would be used to ferry crews.
 - CEV would start flying to the Moon in around 2015-2020
 - No US funding for ISS after 2016 (I wonder what happens if
   ESA and NASDA want to keep it flying? Will the US and Russia
   sell their pieces?)
 - Human missions to Mars and beyond sometime later.
 - International participation invited (but not emphasized)
 - Small increase above inflation to NASA budget for next 5 years,
 - No mention of the status of NASA's space science. The
   budget chart presented by O'Keefe shows "Aeronautics and Other
   Science Activities' with a significant cut over the next
   few years, followed by tiny increase in actual dollars
   and (most importantly) not keeping up with inflation.

Other news
----------

A leak in a hose mechanism attached to the Destiny lab window appears to
be the culprit in  a drop of air pressure in the Space Station during
the first week of 2004. Mike Foale appears to have located and fixed the
leak on Jan 11. A replacement hose will be delivered on the next
Progress.

Analysis of orbital data reveals that the Tan Ce 1 magnetospheric
research satellite launched on Dec 29 used a direct ascent trajectory,
with the final stage firing  immediately after stage 2 cutoff. (Other
possibilities involved a coasting period after stage 2, either in a
parking orbit or with a suborbital coast to the equator). The burn put
the apogee of Tan Ce 1's elliptical orbit at about 23 deg S, and implies
a larger kick stage than some observers had suggested, with a propellant
mass around 1100 kg. If the stage has the same 10.8 kN thrust as the old
Smart Dispenser, and differs simply by having more propellant, the burn
time would be around 290s which seems rather long - a thrust in the
range of 50-100 kN seems more likely.

The Telstar 14 satellite was launched at 0413 UTC on Jan 11 by a Boeing
Sea Launch Zenit-3SL from the Odyssey platform at 154W 0N in the
Pacific. The Energiya DM-SL stage reached initial orbit of around 180 x
913 km x 0 deg at 0426 UTC. A second burn at 0502 UTC put the satellite
in geostationary transfer orbit. Telstar 14 is also called Estrela do
Sul, and is operated by Loral Skynet do Brasil. The satellite is a Loral
LS-1300 with a launch mass of 4694 kg. Reports indicate there have
been problems deploying one of the solar panels.

The NASA/JPL Mars Exploration Rover B (MER-B, MER-1) "Opportunity"
landed on Mars successfully on Jan 25.  On 0433 UTC on Jan 25,
Opportunity's MER-1 cruise stage separated. The lander and the cruise
stage entered the Martian atmosphere at 0448:42 UTC; the cruise stage
burnt up as planned, and the lander deployed its parachute after a
successful reentry at 0503 UTC, followed by heatshield jetison, airbag
deployment and retro rocket firing, with touchdown around 0454:33 UTC
(this was the expected time, I haven't seen a precise actual time). The
airbags bounced several times and began rolling at 0500 UTC, coming to
rest a few minutes later. Petal opening was at 0706 UTC, turning the
spacecraft right way up and revealing the rover inside. Light time to
Earth at the time of landing was 11 min 4s. The Meridiani site is at
about 2 S, 354 E.

The airbag-enclosed lander came to rest inside a small (20 m diameter)
crater. The rover deployed its wheels on Jan 28 and will roll onto the
surface at the weekend. Its landing site has been renamed the Challenger
Memorial Station; the  Spirit site has been named the Columbia Memorial
Station and some hills near the site are named the Apollo 1 Hills,
individually Grissom, White and Chaffee hills. Recall that the Viking 1
lander was named Mutch Memorial Station after Viking imaging team member
Thomas Mutch, and the Pathfinder landing site was called Sagan Memorial
Station after Carl Sagan. In July 2001 Dan Goldin announced that Viking
Lander 2 would be called Soffen Station after the late Gerald Soffen,
but to my knowledge no press release or written announcement about this
was ever made, and I'm not sure if it's official. For the MER sites,
there seems to be some ambiguity about whether the Station is just the
lander, or some poorly defined area surrounding the lander, or all the
way to the local horizon.

The Spirit rover, exploring Gusev crater, entered safemode on Jan 20
because of a file system problem in the vehicle's flash memory.
Controllers are repairing the problem and a full recovery is now
expected; Spirit successfully returned a new surface image on Jan 28.

A Progress M1 cargo ship is scheduled for launch on Jan 29 to bring
supplies to the ISS.

Editorial
---------

My sources confirm that the Hubble servicing mission cancellation
decision was indeed made on grounds of expediting the completion of ISS
and the limited gains from extending Hubble's life, and not largely on
safety grounds per se. Recall that the Columbia accident board
explicitly commented that the mission should not be precluded. Now if
the pragmatic reasons for the move were admitted, I might agree with the
decision anyway if alternate facilities for ultraviolet astronomy are to
made available - but I'm not too optimistic about that. Whatever the
merits, it is clear that major problems remain with vertical
communication in the NASA organization - the folks on the Hubble team
should really have been made more aware that this decision was being
weighed rather than being reassured that SM4 was almost certain to
happen and totally blindsided by the cancellation news (at least, that's
my impression as an outsider after conversations with several Hubblers.)
I don't know where in the management chain this communications failure
happened.

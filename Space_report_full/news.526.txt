   A New Mesonaut
   --------------

The Scaled Composites craft Spaceship One was launched to a 64.4 km
apogee on May 13. The White Knight carrier aircraft took off from Mojave
Airport at 1441 UTC on May 13, and released Spaceship One at 1531 UTC at
an altitude of 14.0 km. After a 10 second drop,  the rocket engine
ignited and burned for 55s. Engine cutoff came at an altitude of about
46 km and an Earth-relative velocity of about 0.8 km/s. (I don't know
the launch azimuth or location, and so can't calculate the inertial
velocity.) Pilot Mike Melvill coasted to apogee and then glided back
down to land at Mojave 20min 44s after launch. This mission, Spaceship
One flight 56L/14P, was higher than all other piloted flights except for
36 flights of the X-15 rocket plane and all conventional spaceflights.
Melvill, born in South Africa, joins a select group of `mesonauts' who
have flown above the stratopause and into the mesosphere (between 50 and
80 km). To date, Milt Thompson was the only mesonaut who never became an
astronaut (flying above the mesopause at 80 km into the exosphere; regular
readers will know that I adopt a boundary of 80 km as the edge of space).

There have been 15 people who have made suborbital flights into
the mesosphere and exosphere. Here I list the date and altitude
of their highest suborbital flight. Armstrong, Engle, Shepard,
Grissom, Lazarev and Makarov also made higher altitude orbital flights;
the lowest apogee orbital flight was probably Vostok-5 with an apogee
of around 209 km.

  ROCSAT-2
  --------

Orbital Sciences launched Taurus flight 7, its first Taurus XL model, on
May 20, orbiting the ROCSAT-2 remote sensing satellite for Taiwan's
National Space Program Office. The satellite was built by Astrium
(Toulouse) and  uses the Leostar 500XO bus. It has a 0.60m diameter
telescope with a 2-m resolution black-and-white imager and an 8-m
resolution color imager as well as a detector to study lightning
'sprites'. The Taurus 3210 model has a Castor 120 solid motor lower
stage, and the three motors from the Pegasus XL - Orion 50SXL, Orion
50XL and Orion 38 - as upper stages. The Orion 50XL stage burnt out in a
-2836 x 714 km x 99 deg suborbital trajectory four minutes after launch;
the final stage and payload coasted to apogee, and at 11 min after
launch the Orion 38 motor fired to put ROCSAT-2 in a 720 x 742 km x 99.1
deg orbit. The satellite will use its onboard propulsion system (with
about 50 kg of hydrazine) to raise its orbit to around 890 km. 

  Superbird-6
  -----------

According to a report in Space News, the Superbird 6 communications
satellite was damaged on a lower than expected first perigee passage.
The spacecraft was launched into an orbit with around 200 km perigee,
but lunar perturbations - which  reportedly had not been taken into
account - lowered the perigee to around 100 km during the first orbit.
An engine firing raised the perigee to over 1000 km, and later burns up
to May 10  put the satellite in a near-geosynchronous drift orbit at
35834 x 35964 km x 0.1 deg over the Pacific at 157 deg E. No tracking
data was released for the Centaur stage, but Space Command estimates it
reentered on Apr 19, presumably at its second perigee.

  AMC-11
  ------

Atlas Centaur flight AC-166, another Atlas IIAS model with four solid
strapons, roared into a 186 x 35926 km x 12.4 deg geostationary transfer
orbit on May 19 with the AMC 11 (Americom 11) communications satellite
for SES Americom. AMC 11 will replace Satcom C-3 and is a Lockheed
Martin A2100 series model.

 Mars Express
 ------------

Mars Express lowered the apoapsis of its orbit around Mars on May 6,
changing the orbit from about 266 x 11580 km x 86.6 deg to about 266 x
10046 km x 86.6 deg.

 Hayabusa
 --------

The Japanese Hayabusa probe made an Earth flyby on May 19 with
a closest approach altitude of 3725 km at 0623 UTC. It is expected
to reach asteroid (25143) Itokawa in 2005.

 Kosmos-2406
 -----------

The Blok DM-2 stage from the Globus (Kosmos-2406) launch  has been
tracked in a 1438 minute orbit, drifting just above the geostationary
ring. If this identification is correct, the earlier Space Command
publication of a 1330 minute initial orbit for Kosmos-2406 must have
been an error.

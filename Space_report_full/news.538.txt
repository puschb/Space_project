* Soyuz-2-1A

The first launch of the improved Soyuz-2-1A rocket was carried out on
Nov 8 from Russia's Plesetsk spaceport. The standard Soyuz-U or Soyuz-FG
rocket, made by TsSKB-Progress in Samara, consists of the 11S59 `packet'
made up of a central core (Blok A) surrounded by four almost-as-large
strapon boosters (Blok B, V, G, D), together with the 11S510 upper stage
also known as Blok I. The `packet' is the direct descendant of the 
8K71 rocket used to launch Sputnik in 1957. The Soyuz-2-1A is very similar,
but carries improved digital avionics and uses 14D21 and 14D22 engines.

This launch carried a leftover Oblik spy satellite, carrying
launch vehicle monitoring equipment to record accelerations, vibrations
and temperatures, and presumably stripped of the normal camera
equipment. The Oblik was a derivative of the original Vostok/Zenit spy satellite
and was last launched on a civilian mapping mission ten years ago.

Prelaunch reports indicated that the rocket would reach orbit, but it
now appears that it only reached a suborbital path; no apogee and
perigee and no orbital inclination have been quoted for the mission,
which makes it hard for outside observers to judge independently 
whether or not the launch was in fact successful.

According to a Roskosmos press release, "the launcher rocket 
successfully delivered to orbit a mass-size mockup of a spacecraft,
which at 2138 [Moscow time] was sunk in the waters of the Pacific
Ocean". The phrasing suggests to me that the 11S510 final stage should
be in orbit, with the payload deorbited immediately after separation
using its own retrorocket engine. But it appears this was misleading;
another statement from the Progress rocket manufacturers in Samara
implied that the rocket only reached a suborbital trajectory, i.e.
reached an orbit with a negative perigee, with both 11S510 stage and
payload falling in the Pacific. This interpretation is supported by the
failure of US Space Command to catalog the launch.  In my own system I
(provisionally) have designated the launch 2004-U01 (U for
'uncataloged') on the assumption that it was in orbit or near-orbit for
a brief time.

The 1838 UTC 'sinking' time must refer to the time of 11S510 engine
cutoff; actual impact would have been closer to 1900 UTC.

* Ekspress AM-1

The Ekspress AM-1 Russian domestic communications satellite, built by
Reshetnev (NPO PM) for Kosmicheskaya Svyaz, was launched on Oct 29 on a
Krunichev Proton-K with an Energiya DM-2M (11S861-01) upper stage. The
DM-2M delivered the satellite to geostationary orbit. The satellite's
comms payload was built by the Japanese companies NEC and Toshiba.

The Ekspress series has had three generations: Ekspress, Ekspress A,
Ekspress AM. (The satellites are often called Express in English; I use
the odd spelling to reflect a direct transliteration from the Russian.)
The Ekspress-AM uses an improved Ekspress-M or 727M bus, first used
on the Sesat satellite, while the earlier models use the KAUR-4 MSO-2500
bus.

* Navstar SVN 61

Global Positioning Satellite SVN 61, or flight IIR-13, was launched on
Nov 6. The Delta II rocket entered a 174 x 393 km x 36.9 de g parking
orbit and then a 191 x 1270 km x 37.2 deg intermediate orbit, at which
point the solid PAM-D third stage separated and fired to put the GPS
payload in a 173 x 20371 km x 39.1 deg transfer orbit. The satellite's
apogee motor will fire to circularize the orbit. The GPS Block IIR
satellites are built by Lockheed Martin/Sunnyvale.

* ZY-2C

The third ZY-2 satellite was launched on Nov 6. The satellite is
a low orbit digital imaging spacecraft used by the Chinese government,
probably for both civilian and military reconnaissance purposes.
Initial orbit is 472 x 483 km x 97.3 deg.

* SMART-1

The European SMART-1 probe made its third lunar resonance gravity assist
on Oct 12 and on Oct 26 was in a 173339 x 298835 km x 20.6 deg deep
Earth orbit. The continued gravitational effect of the Moon raised the
orbit until lunar capture on Nov 15. On Nov 11 the spacecraft finally
passed through the weak stability boundary region at the Earth-Moon L1
point, where small changes to the probe's path result in large
alterations to its final orbit, and where the orbit becomes better
described as Moon-centered rather than Earth-centered. The probe reached
perilune on Nov 15 at 1748 UTC and entered a 4962 x 51477 km orbit
around the Moon inclined at 81 degrees to the lunar equator. This is the
most loosely bound lunar orbit ever achieved, with its highest point
close to the Earth-Moon gravitational boundary - the US record-holder
Explorer 35 in 1967 had an apolune of only 7800 km, while the 1990s
Japanese probes Hagoromo and Hiten had apolunes of 22000 and 49400 km
respectively; the Apollo missions  went directly to low orbits with
apolunes of only 300 km. SMART-1's ion engine was restarted at orbit
insertion to lower the orbital altitude and bind it more tightly the
Moon; final orbit will be reached in January.

* Helios 1B

The French spy satellite Helios 1B has been taken out of service. In
mid-October the orbit of the satellite was lowered from 679 x 681 km x
98.2 deg to 637 x 640 km x 98.2 deg, taking it out of the path of 
Helios 1A and future successors.

* MicroLabSat

The two tiny RITE Target subsatellites released by the Japanese
MicroLabSat on 2003 Mar 14  (see JSR 509) have now been cataloged by
Space Command.

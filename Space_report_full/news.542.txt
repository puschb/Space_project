* Space Station

Progress M-51 docked with the Zvezda module on Dec 25 at 2358 UTC,
bringing critical food supplies to crewmembers Chiao and Sharipov aboard
the Station.

* Sich-1M

Russian authorities have confirmed that Sich-1M and Mikron did not reach
their planned orbits. 

After launch at 1120 UTC on Dec 24, the Tsiklon-3 launch vehicle first
stage separated at 48 km altitude and coasted to around 70 km before
falling back to Earth. The second stage burned for two minutes and
entered an approximately -2600 x 180 km suborbital path, falling in the
East Siberian sea. The first burn of the third stage  should have placed
the vehicle in a roughly 78 x 650 km transfer orbit at 1126 UTC,
coasting over the Arctic and then southward over the Pacific until 1200
UTC when it was at around 24 deg south latitude, while rising towards
apogee. At this point the third stage fired again, raising the perigee
point from 78 km to 280 km. The velocity increase was about 100 m/s too
small to get to the desired 650 km circular orbit. (Russian newspapers
have suggested that Sich-1M has an onboard propulsion system which will
be used to reach the target orbit, but  earlier satellites in the series
don't have such a system and it's not mentioned in the official
publicity information about the satellite). The MK-1TS subsatellite was
attached to Sich-1M, and ejected from it at about 2100 UTC on Dec 25.

* GLONASS

Three Russian navigation satellites in orbit plane 1 of the GLONASS
system were launched on Dec 26 from Baykonur by a Krunichev Proton-K
rocket (serial 410-09) with an Energiya Blok DM-2 (serial 11S861 No.
104L) upper stage. Two of the satellites are standard Uragan satellites
built by Polyot/Omsk,  nos. 796 and 797, and one is an Uragan-M, no.
712, with an uprated Glonass-M payload, built by Reshetnev
NPO-PM/Krasnoyarsk. They have been given the military cover names
Kosmos-2411 to Kosmos-2413. This was the 33rd launch in the GLONASS
program, and the third with an Uragan-M test flight. GLONASS is the Russian
equivalent of the GPS system.

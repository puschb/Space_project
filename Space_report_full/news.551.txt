Shuttle and Station
-------------------

The Shuttle has completed its return-to-flight mission, but continuing
problems with debris marred the otherwise successful flight.

Discovery was launched at 1439:00 UTC on Jul 26, reaching a 54 x 229 km
orbit at 1447 UTC. The OMS-2 burn at 1517 UTC raised the perigee out of
the atmosphere, with a 155 x 230 km orbit. NC-1 and NC-2 burns resulted
in 226 x 285 km and 270 x 287 km orbits, as the Shuttle slowly matched
altitude and speed with the Station in a 350 x 356 km x 51.6 deg orbit.
Meanwhile, external tank ET-121 fell back into the Pacific with reentry
at around 1550 UTC.

Spectacular camera views from the External Tank showed minor tile damage
during ascent, and the loss of a half-meter piece of foam from the ET at
the time of SRB separation. Although the foam did not hit Discovery, the
failure to stop large foam loss (a 15-cm piece was also lost from near
the bipod ramp) will have to be investigated and fixed before Atlantis
can fly the next mission.

On Jul 19 the Station crew flew Soyuz TMA-6 from the Pirs docking port,
undocking at 1038 UTC, and redocked with the Zarya docking port at 1108 UTC.

On Jul 28 at 1118 UTC Discovery docked at the Space Station. Hatch
opening was at 1250 UTC. The first spacewalk was carried out on Jul 30
and saw tile repair tests in the payload bay, and installation of a
mounting bracket for the ESP-2 stores platform on the Station's Quest
module.

The second spacewalk on Aug 1 saw replacement of the Station's CMG-1 gyro.
The third spacewalk on Aug 3 saw installation of the ESP-2 platform,
and the removal of two protruding pieces of tile gap-filler material
from the Shuttle's heat shield.

Discovery undocked from Station at 0724 UTC on Aug 6 and landed safely
on Runway 22 at Edwards Air Force Base at 1211 UTC on Aug 9.


Suzaku
------

The newly-launched Suzaku mission has lost the use of its premier
instrument, the XRS, according to a JAXA press release on Aug 9.
This is a big blow to X-ray astronomy, following a 15-year struggle
to get the experiment into orbit.

Suzaku extended its optical bench on Jul 12, completing the most
critical events of its early orbit operations. The first few element
sets from Space Command seem to have confused Suzaku and its M34 final
stage; the final stage is in a 248 x 540 km orbit and Suzaku was
initially in a higher-perigee 295 x 540 km orbit. The satellite carries
100 kg of hydrazine for its four 23N main orbit raise thrusters which
were used to reach its 565 x 573 km operational orbit by Jul 22. The XRS
instrument was cooled down to 60 milliKelvin and showing good resolution
on the internal calibration source by Jul 29. The three-stage cooler
involves an active cooler surrounded by liquid helium and solid neon.
Sadly, on around Aug 7 a leak in the cooler system resulted in loss of the
liquid helium, and without the coolant XRS can't return the planned
high resolution spectra.

XRS, the first X-ray microcalorimeter detector in orbit, was developed
by NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center and Japan's ISAS science division
of the JAXA space agency. It was originally planned to be aboard the
AXAF (Chandra) mission, then split off into a separate AXAF-S mission
that was later cancelled, and eventually added to the Japanese ASTRO-E
mission which failed in 2000.

Calorimeter detectors are expected to play an important role in future
X-ray missions, but although an XRS-type instrument successfully made
astronomical observations on suborbital rocket flight NASA 27.140UH in
1996, there has been no long duration test of the technology to date.
Suzaku's other instruments - four X-ray CCD telescopes and a high energy
X-ray detector - are still being checked out and so far appear to be
operating well.

Chinese recoverable satellite
-----------------------------

A Chinese recoverable satellite, FSW 21, was launched on Aug 2
from Jiuquan into a 165 x 494 km x 63.0 deg orbit.


Errata
-------

The temperature of the XRS on ASTRO-E2 is 60 mK, not 1.5 mK - sorry.
Deep Space 1 flew past Borrelly at 2230:37TT 2001 Sep 22, not Sep 17.

Delta Confusion
---------------

In a number of NASA documents in the past year, I've seen alternative
designations for Boeing's Delta rockets that don't seem to be used
in Boeing's public documents. For example:

  Boeing designation  NASA designation       
  7320-10,7326-9.5    2320-10,2326-9.5
  7420-10             2420-10
  7920-10L            2920-10L
  7925H-9.5           2925H-9.5
  4M                  4040
  4M+(4,2)            4240
  4M+(5,4)            4450
  4H                  4050H

So I'm confused. Are these new names just NASA renaming things to
confuse the issue (as they have done with their own names for Russian
Progress and Soyuz spacecraft) or are these official Boeing designations
and Boeing haven't updated their press kits and web sites? I'd
appreciate email from anyone who can clarify the status of these
designation systems. [Indeed, one correspondent seems to confirm
my suspicion that this is another random NASA renaming of someone
else's product. I will continue to use the manufacturer's designations.]

I've ranted in the past that the Boeing Delta 4M/4H designation scheme
is ugly. The form of the new scheme is better, but there's a bit of
a problem. The first digit in the Delta 4-digit designations indicates
the first stage configuration; in the new scheme it looks nice and
sensible, 2 for Delta 2 and 4 for Delta 4. But the reason it's 7 in
the old scheme for Delta 2 is that there were 6 earlier variants of
first stage, and indeed earlier Deltas included the Delta
2310, 2313, 2910, 2913, 2914 and 4925-8. It's a bit confusing that
the 2310 (old scheme, 1970s Delta) and the 2320 (new scheme, Delta II)
are such completely different vehicles, and sheer luck that there are
no exact duplications. I understand the marketing people don't care since
no-one is trying to sell a 2310 anymore... but for those who maintain
historical records it's very confusing. How about just renaming Delta II
and Delta IV to Delta IX and Delta X instead?

By the way, for those without a scorecard, the full scheme is:
digit 1 - first stage type; digit 2 - number of small strapons; digit 3 -
second stage type; digit 4 - third stage type; optional letter H for
'Heavy', means slightly bigger strapons for Delta 2 and strapon core stages
for Delta 4; - stuff following dash, means diameter of fairing for Delta 2
(currently coupled to second stage type for Delta 4).

Globalstar
----------

A number of Globalstar low orbit communications satellites have
had their orbits raised recently, presumably indicating their retirement.
The operational orbit is 1412 x 1414 km x 52.0 deg; of the 52 satellites
which reached orbit, 45 are in this operational orbit. The retirement
orbit is 1512 x 1514 km; satellite M002, put in the retirement orbit
in Nov 2001, had its orbit raised again in Apr-Jul 2005 to a still higher
orbit of 1808 km. I infer that the 1512 x 1514 km orbit is for satellites
which are out of the operational constellation but still partly functional,
and that satellite 2's recent orbit raising involves depletion of remaining
propellants prior to final switch-off. The lower 1450 km orbit
of satellite 1 may indicate that it didn't have enough fuel to
reach the standard retirement orbit.

  Retired satellite   Date retired  Current orbit
? 64    2000-08D      2000 Feb 17    909 x  926 km x 52.0 deg (Never operational)
   2    1998-08C      2001 Nov 20   1807 x 1809 km x 52.0 deg
  14    1998-23A      2001 Oct  1?  1499 x 1525 km x 52.0 deg
  35    1999-37A      2005 Apr  6   1512 x 1514 km x 52.0 deg
   1    1998-08A      2005 Apr 22   1452 x 1455 km x 52.0 deg
  27    1999-43C      2005 May 15?  1513 x 1514 km x 52.0 deg  
  61    1999-62D      2005 May 23   1512 x 1514 km x 52.0 deg


It's possible that satellite 64 is in reserve for future use, but
I think it is more likely that its propulsion system failed to operate.



Iridium
-------

There are 66 Iridium satellites in the operational constellation. A
further 11 working satellites are in orbital storage. 18 other
satellites appear to have failed, but only three of these failures have
happened since completion of the initial constellation in 1999. Iridium
16, retired in Apr 2005, was quickly replaced by Iridium vehicle 86.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Station
-------

The Progress M-54 cargo spacecraft (factory number 354) was launched by
Soyuz-U from Baykonur on Sep 8 and docked with Zvezda at 1442 UTC on Sep
10. Progress M-53 undocked from the Zvezda module at 1026 UTC on Sep 7
into a 350 x 351 km orbit; it fired its deorbit engine at 1326 UTC to
lower perigee to 56 km, leading to reentry over the Pacific half an
orbit later.

The next Shuttle flight is delayed indefinitely - engineers don't
yet understand the aerodynamic data from the last flight. Damage to the
External Tank manufacturing facility in New Orleans was less that
feared, and ET work will continue there.


Kosmos-2415
-----------

As expected, Kosmos-2415 entered its operational mapping orbit of
205 x 284 km x 64.9 deg on Sep 3.

Anik F1R
---------

International Launch Services orbited a Proton-M/Briz on Sep 8 carrying
the Anik F1R communications satellite.

Telesat Canada inaugurated Canada's domestic satellite communications
service with the launch of Anik A1 in 1972. The first two 5-tonne
Anik F satellites were launched in 2000 and 2004 using Boeing 702
satellites; Anik F1 has been experiencing solar panel power problems.
Anik F1R is an Astrium Eurostar 3000S operating in C-band and Ku-band.

The Proton-M flew a suborbital trajectory; the Briz made one burn to low
parking orbit and four more burns to a  3171 x 35608 km x 10 deg
deployment orbit. Anik F1R then separated to being using its own engine
to reach geostationary orbit.


Haybusa
-------

Hayabusa is completing its rendezvous with asteroid Itokawa.
On Sep 12 it began hovering at the 20 km "gate position".
It will descend to 7 km in October.

Streak
------

DARPA's Streak classified research satellite, also called
STP-R1 under the USAF's Space Test Program, was launched by Minotaur
from Vandenberg on Sep 23. The satellite carries experimental
sensors to study the orbital environment and is in a sun-synchronous
orbit.


POPPY
-----

The NRO has declassified the existence of the Naval Research Lab's POPPY
signals intelligence satellites. POPPY were probably small spherical (later,
ellipsodal?) satellites, derived from the Vanguard spheres used for the
predecessor program GRAB/DYNO. NRO says it will release pictures, but
that hasn't happened yet: I predict POPPY will look like the GGSE satellites
as seen here: <P><IMG SRC="http://www.planet4589.org/space/jsr/poppy/65016C.gif">

They were launched in clusters together with other small NRL satellites
on Thor Agena D rockets. POPPY flew from 1962 to 1971, followed by the
still-classified PARCAE program which began in 1976 and used triplets of
satellites for radio interferometric measurements of signal locations.
The GRAB satellites were 0.51m in diameter like Vanguard; POPPY may have
been the same size initially and then increased to 0.61m in diameter. In
fact, the early POPPY satellites may have been leftover GRAB vehicles,
with the code name change simply due to the transfer of the GRAB mission
from NRL to NRO in mid-1962. The RAE Tables indicate the shift to 0.61m
diameter happened with the first POPPY launch, but I'm not sure RAE is a
reliable source in this particular context.

Despite the declassification of POPPY, it's still not clear which
satellites were POPPY satellites. Here I put down my own guesses,
but mainly I point out that things are confused. Comments welcome.

The POPPY fact sheet says that "A total of seven POPPY satellites
launched into space from 1962 to 1971", and gives the seven launch
dates. This implies that only one POPPY satellite went up on each
of the seven launches.

For the time being I am assuming that this is false and that it should
read "There were a total of seven launches in the POPPY program from
1962 to 1971". The followon program starting in 1976 involved multiple
satellites, and the final POPPY launch in 1971 consisted of four
apparently identical satellites. 

The alternate possibility is that one of the four 1971-110 payloads was
a POPPY and the other three were something different. That's not
impossible, but I'd be surprised.

On the assumption, then, that each launch might have multiple POPPY
satellites, let's try and identify them. For each launch I list at the
bottom of this all objects noted in the US Space Command SATCAT as
payloads, and their SATCAT names. I also list the satellites listed for
that launch date in a summary of NRL-launched spacecraft from the Naval
Center for Space Technology; there's no mapping given between those
names and the international designations (e.g. NRL 130 is one of the
1963-021 objects but we don't know which one). There are also blatant
inconsistencies between the two sources - for instance, on 1963-021
"Dosimeter" and "PL 112" are separate satellites in the NCST list, in
contrast to 1963-021D "RADOSE 112" which suggests the two are the same
radiation dosimeter satellite. 

Nevertheless, we can make some guesses. Look at the NCST listings, and
accept my guess that the last POPPY launch is the quartet of payloads
171-174, listed by NCST as gravity gradient experiments with masses of
123 to 128 kg. Then notice that the 1969-082 launch has similar payloads
161-164 with masses of 100-103 kg; and that 1967-053 has payloads 151
and 153 listed interspersed with GGSE 4 and 5:
    
           PL 151        Grav Grad expt.     52 kg   POPPY 5A? 1967-53G?
           GGSE IV       Grav Grad expt.     85 kg
           PL 153        Grav Grad expt.     77 kg   POPPY 5B? 1967-53H?
           GGSE V        Grav Grad expt.    105 kg

I'm guessing the GGSEs here are PL152 and PL154, completing the
quartet. Published papers show they had different boom configurations.
Now I'm guessing that the GGSE (Gravity Gradient Stabilization
Experiment) series was linked to POPPY; that POPPY flights 
were gravity-stabilized and GGSE was used to improve them. GGSE satellites
may be modified POPPY satellites with no ELINT payload, or may
be fully functional POPPY with the GGSE test as an add-on experiment.

So working further back, in the previous launch (launch 4) there's no quartet,
but we can look at a number of candidates: the classified statellites,
the GGSE satellites, and the Solrad satellites.

Solrad satellites are possibilities because they were used in the GRAB
(GREB) program, but I note that in the SATCAT the GREB name is given to
PL 135 and PL142, not to SR VIIA and SR VIIB, so probably there was
no room in a 24-inch sphere for both the POPPY and SR payloads and the
programs were separated at the beginning of the POPPY program.
What can we make of the SATCAT calling PL142 "GREB 6"? Maybe the 
Launch 1 and Launch 2 POPPY flights were initially called GRAB (or GREB)
5A and 5B, following on from the last known SR IVB flight of GRAB.


Launch 1:
           PL 120          Classified   POPPY 1A?   25 kg  62 B TAU 1?
           PL 121          Classified   POPPY 1B?   25 kg  62 B TAU 5?

Launch 2:
           SR VI         Solar X-rays 
           PL 112           Classified  POPPY 2?    27 kg  1963-21E?

Launch 3:
           SR VIIA       Solar X-rays
           GGSE 1        Grav grad exp.
           PL 135        Classified     POPPY 3?    39 kg  1964-01E

Launch 4:
           SR VIIB        Solar X-rays
           PL 142         Classified    POPPY 4?    48 kg  1965-16A
           GGSE II        Grav. grad exp.
           GGSE III       Grav. grad exp.

I'll advance the following hypotheses:

 - Hypothesis 1.  All the above satellites were POPPY or, in the
   case of GGSE, POPPY-related.

-  Hypothesis 2: The POPPY satellites were SR VI, SR VIIA, SR VIIB, 
   continuing the GRAB/SOLRAD cover story. The Dec 1962
   launch was one or both of PL120 and PL121, with the other one perhaps being
   a thermal control experiment ("BLACK SPHERE" in the SATCAT;
   the "SURCAL 1" in the SATCAT is assumed to be an error, since
   SURCAL 1 was lost in a Jan 1962 launch failure). It's also possible
   that "BLACK SPHERE" and "CALSPHERE 1A" are really the same satellite.
   Both PL120 and PL121 had a mass of 55 kg, the same as GRAB.

-  Hypothesis 3: After the GRAB program ended, the SOLRAD series
   became fully scientific because POPPY needed a whole satellite to  
   itself and couldn't share. The GGSE satellites weren't related
   to POPPY. The POPPY satellites were 
   PL120 and PL121; PL112; PL135; and PL142. I still think
   that PL 151/153, PL 161-164, PL171-174 were POPPY group flights.
   The role of PL176 (1962-082B) is still a mystery; it was a smaller
   (23 kg) NRL satellite that operated for 2 years.

-  Hypothesis 4: the POPPY satellites aren't any of the ones listed
   here, but were packages which remained attached to the Agena rocket
   stages. This would let you have a single POPPY on the 1971-110 launch
   separate from the confusion of the four identical payloads; but
   I find it unlikely.

 
Right now, my best guess is Hypothesis 3.

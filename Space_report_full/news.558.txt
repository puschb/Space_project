There have been no new orbital launches since JSR 557.

Hayabusa
--------

Hayabusa's new attempt to land on asteroid (25143) Itokawa was
successful at 2207 UTC on Nov 25.  It is now unclear whether the
sampler device fired its pellet into Itokawa to
collect asteroidal dust. The vehicle took off again shortly afterwards.
However, the vehicle then went into safe mode following failures in the
thruster system. Limited control over Hayabusa has now been
reestablished, but it is not clear whether a return to Earth will be
possible.


Sinah-1
-------

Henk Smid draws my attention to evidence that the Iranian Sinah-1
satellite uses Polyot's Sterkh satellite bus, which is also intended for
use with future Nadezhda satellites. According to Novosti Kosmonavtiki
(2001, No. 8, p48) in 2001 plans for Sterkh said it was 80-100 kg, 1.0m
high and 0.4m diameter, and would have a design life of 5 years. Sinah-1
has a mass of 160 kg.


Surrey Satellite
----------------

This week I visited Surrey Satellite Technology Ltd. in Guildford, which
is a small city southwest of London and a few miles from the town in
which I spent my teenage years. It's a little bizarre to me that quiet
little Guildford has become a major center of the British space
industry. (Also notable in the UK is the Aerojet propulsion plant,
formerly Royal Ordnance, which makes the Leros apogee engines used on
large communications satellites and some planetary probes; and the EADS
Astrium plant at Stevenage which makes large commercial satellite
payloads,  although it's not clear to me how much of the spacecraft bus
work is done at Stevenage versus the Astrium plants in France. 
EADS-Astrium is a bigger operation, but its multinational nature
obscures the UK contribution - SSTL's activities are more
internationally visible as a UK space activity. Perhaps an Astrium
reader will let me know what exactly happens at Stevenage, Portsmouth
and Poynton.)

In 1981 Martin Sweeting of the University of Surrey's engineering
department led a project to build a small 52-kg amateur radio satellite,
UoSAT-1, which was launched as a piggyback payload on a Delta.
Sweeting's team, which became SSTL, have built on this effort and become
a leading provider of entry-level satellites to developing nations
including Algeria, Nigeria, Thailand and Malaysia. Their latest and much
more ambitious satellite is Giove 1, the first test craft for the
European Galileo navigation satellite system, which is now awaiting
launch at Baykonur. 

SSTL is in a small brick office building on the University campus; in
addition to small clean rooms for solar array fabrication (done in-house
to avoid long lead times), propulsion (also done in-house with butane,
nitrogen and other propellants)  and electronics assembly, a single
larger clean room - still very modest in size by big-aerospace-company
standards - is used for assembly and integration. When I visited, the
Los Alamos Cibola Flight Experiment satellite was being built, with
racks for the RapidEye imaging constellation awaiting assembly. Recent
launches include another entry in SSTL's Disaster Monitoring
Constellation, which is an innovative system with a group of 100-kg
class satellites carrying 32-m resolution imagers. Each satellite is
owned by a different country - Algeria, Nigeria, China, UK, and Turkey
so far - and normally controlled separately, but can be coordinated at
SSTL to get rapid imagery of disaster sites like the East Asian tsunami
or  Hurricane Katrina.

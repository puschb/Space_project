Atlantis has been rolled out to the pad for mission
STS-38. Columbia has been rolled out for another 
tanking test. Discovery is on its way back to Florida.

Gennadiy Manakov and Gennadiy Strekalov continue in orbit aboard the
Mir/Kvant/Kvant-2/Kristall/Soyuz TM-10/Progress M-5 complex.  They will
make an EVA in a few days.

A Chinese Fanhui Shi Weixing (FSW, experimental recoverable satellite) 
was launched on Oct 5 by CZ-2C launch vehicle from Jiuquan. It will
probably stay in orbit for 8 days. The flight is the first Chinese
life sciences mission.

Two Hughes communications satellites, SBS 6 and Galaxy VI, were launched
on an Ariane 44L vehicle, flight V39, from Kourou on Oct 12.  SBS has a
complicated history.  In 1980, Satellite Business Systems, a consortium
of IBM, Aetna, and Comsat, launched its first satellite for Ku-band
(14/12 GHz) business data relay services.  In Jul 1984, Comsat left the
consortium.  In Jul 1985, Satellite Business Systems was sold to MCI;
four satellites were now in orbit.  Then, in (I think) 1987, the fleet
was sold off.  SBS 1 and 2 were sold to Comsat, SBS 3 remained with MCI,
and SBS 4 was sold to IBM's Satellite Transponder Leasing Corp (STLC)
together with the SBS 5 and 6 satellites still on the ground.  Finally,
in Apr 1990, Hughes Communications Inc (HCI) bought STLC from IBM. 
This leaves the fleet as follows:

Satellite/type	Launch Date	Vehicle	    Owner    	Owner 
					   (at launch)	(now)
SBS 1	HS376	1980 Nov 15	Delta 153   SBS		Comsat Corp
SBS 2	HS376	1981 Sep 24	Delta 156   SBS		Comsat Corp
SBS 3	HS376	1982 Nov 11	STS 5	    SBS		MCI Comms. Corp
SBS 4	HS376	1984 Aug 16	STS 41-D    SBS		Hughes HCI
SBS 5	HS376	1988 Sep  8	Ariane V25  IBM STLC	Hughes HCI
SBS 6	HS393	1990 Oct 12	Ariane V39  Hughes HCI  Hughes HCI

There are no more SBS satellites to come. (It's possible I may have
got some of this story wrong, and I welcome additions/corrections).

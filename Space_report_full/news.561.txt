Station
-------

Expedition 12 astronauts McArthur and Tokarev made a spacewalk on Feb 3
from the Pirs airlock module using spacesuits Orlan-M No. 25 and No. 27
respectively. The airlock was depressurized at 2225 UTC; hatch open was
at 2244 UTC. Surplus spacesuit Orlan-M No. 14, modified into the
RadioSkaf satellite by addition of amateur radio equipment from
AMSAT-NA, was jettisoned by hand at 2302 UTC.  RadioSkaf was cataloged
as 2005-35C, associating it with the Progress M-54 launch which brought
the radio equipment to the station (Orlan-M 14 itself was launched
aboard Pirs in 2001). As of Feb 18 the suit was still transmitting but
much more weakly than expected. It has been give the amateur radio
satellite designation AMSAT-OSCAR 54.

The astronauts relocated an attachment fixture from Zarya to the PMA3
docking adapter; failed to add a safing bolt to a cable on the Mobile
Transporter, and tied down the cable instead. They retrieved the Biorisk
experiment from the outside of the Pirs module and carried out a photo
survey of the exterior of the Zvezda module. At 0359 UTC on Feb 3 they
jettisoned a couple of cleaning towels, and at 0417 they went back
inside Pirs with hatch closed at 0427 UTC and repressurization beginning
at 0433 UTC.


Daichi
------

Japan's Advanced Land Observing Satellite, ALOS (Riku iki kansoku
gijutsu eisei) was launched on Jan 23 by an H2A from Tanegashima into a
697 x 697 km x 98 deg orbit and named "Daichi" (Land). Daichi carries an
L-band synthetic aperture radar, an optical 2.5-meter resolution mapping
camera, and a 10-meter resolution visible/near-infrared radiometer. JAXA
(the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency) manages the satellite and was
apparently also the effective prime contractor, with Mitsubishi, NEC and
Toshiba as subcontractors.

The flight 8 H2A launch used a 2022 configuration with two SRB-A large
strapons, 2 SSB Castor IVL smaller strapons, and a type 5S large
fairing. The rocket launched southbound from Tanegashima and the second
stage made a single burn to reach orbit. The H2A launch vehicle is
operated and marketed by Rocket Systems Corp. (Kabushikigaisha Roketto
Shisutemu) with actual launch activities carried out by JAXA  (Ucyu
Koukou Kenkyu Kaihatsu Kikou).

Daichi is in a 697 x 700 km x 98.2 deg orbit; the second stage
made a depletion burn which lowered it to a 548 x 699 km orbit.

MTSAT-2
-------

Another H2A mission followed on Feb 18, with MTSAT-2 reaching 
geostationary transfer orbit. MTSAT-2, a Multifunctional Transport
Satellite (Unyu tamokuteki eisei shin), is jointly owned by JCAB (the
Japan Civil Aviation Bureau, koukuu kyoku) and JMA (Kisho-chou, the
Japanese Meteorological Agency), both under the Ministry of Land,
Infrastructure and Transport (Kokudo koutsuushou). Its aeronautical
payload provides communications relay between aircraft and air traffic
control, GPS augmentation navigation for aircraft, and transmits the
location of aircraft to air traffic control. The JAMI  (Japan Advanced
Meteorological Imager) weather camera has one visible and four infrared
channels. MTSAT-2 was built by Mitsubishi using the new DS2000 bus, and
has the same general layout as the Loral 1300 satellites used for
MTSAT-1: a box-shaped bus with a solar panel array on one side and a
long boom with a small conical solar sail on the opposite side. MTSAT-2
has a Japanese (IHI) 500N apogee thruster, and its launch mass is 4650
kg. Span is 30m, and bus size is probably around 4 x 4 x 6m.
It is likely that MTSAT-2 will be renamed Himawari-7.

Although there are two launch pads at Tanegashima's Yoshinobu launch
complex,  I believe that both launches used the main (no. 1) pad - in
fact, I don't think the second pad has ever been used for a launch. Can
anyone confirm this?



NIMS
----

As of January 2006, at least NNS (Navy Navigation Satellite) satellites
O-23, O-25, O-31, O-32 are still operating and part of the NIMS (Navy
Ionospheric Monitoring System) constellation. O-27 and O-29 may still
also be alive (O-27 was alive in Jan 2000 but may have fallen silent in
2001). Thanks to Richard Lang for leads on this issue (see JSR 560).


New Horizons
------------

 New Horizons made its first pair of trajectory corrections, TCM-1A and
1B, on Jan 28 and 30; TCM-3 is scheduled for March. Pluto flyby
will be at 1158 UTC on 2015 Jul 14.

Echostar 10
-----------

US television broadcaster Echostar saw the launch of its Echostar 10
satellite on Feb 15. Echostar 10 is a 4333 kg Lockheed Martin A2100AX
satellite with a Ku-band comms payload. Launch was by Sea Launch
Zenit-3SL from the floating Odyssey platform at the equator. At 2348 UTC
the DM reached a 180 x 2105 km x 0 deg parking orbit. At 0022 UTC on Feb
16, the DM burned again and delivered Echostar 10 to geostationary
transfer orbit. The DM  separated from Echostar 10 at 0037 UTC.

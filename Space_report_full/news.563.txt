Station
-------

There's been a lot of traffic at the International Space Station
over the past month.

The Progress M-54 cargo ship undocked from the Zvezda module on
Mar 3 at 1006 UTC and fired its engines to reenter over the Pacific at
1305 UTC. Progress M-55 remains docked to the Pirs module.

At 0649 UTC on Mar 20 McArthur and Tokarev flew Soyuz TMA-7 from the
Zarya docking port to the docking port at the aft end of Zvezda, with
docking at 0711 UTC. This leaves Zarya free to welcome Soyuz TMA-8 early
on Apr 1.

At 0230 UTC on Mar 30 spacecraft Soyuz TMA-8 was launched from Baykonur
with commander Pavel Vinogradov, NASA astronaut Jeffrey Williams and
Brazilian astronaut Marcos Pontes. TMA-8 docked with the Zarya nadir
port at 0419 UTC on Apr 1.

McArthur, Tokarev and Pontes transferred to TMA-7 on Apr 8, closing the
hatches at 1715 UTC and undocking from Zvezda at 2028 UTC, leaving
Vinogradov and Williams as Expedition 13 in charge of the station.
Soyuz TMA-7 fired its engines at 2258 UTC for the deorbit burn
and landed in Kazakhstan at 2348 UTC.

The Progress M-56 cargo ship was launched on Apr 24
and is en route for docking with the Zvezda module.


Falcon 1
--------

The first launch of SpaceX's Falcon 1 rocket ended in a failure within
the first minute of flight (available video ends at about 41s after
launch with the vehicle heading back down to the ocean). According to SpaceX
founder Elon Musk, a fuel leak at T+25s caused a fire in the first stage
engine area. The Falcon 1 was launched from Omelek Island, Kwajalein
Atoll on Mar 24 carrying the 20 kg Falconsat-2 test/science payload for
the USAF Academy and DARPA. It's been reported from Kwaj
(kwajrockets.blogspot.com) that the payload fell back to Earth through
the roof of SpaceX's machine shop.


Arabsat 4A
-----------

The Arabsat 4A satellite, stranded in transfer orbit by a Krunichev
Briz-M failure on Feb 28, was removed from orbit on Mar 24. The
satellite probably fired its apogee engine around 0020 UTC to lower its
perigee into the atmosphere; according to an MSNBC press report it
reentered over the South Pacific at 0207 UTC.


Space Technology 5
------------------

Space Technology 5, one of NASA's New Millenium Program projects, was
launched on 2006 Mar 22. ST5 consists of three small spacecraft 25 kg in
mass, 0.5m high 0.5m diaemter with a small extensible magnetometer boom.
The Goddard-built craft will study the magnetosphere, but the main point
of the project -also known as Nanosat Constellation Trailblazer - is to
demonstrate fully functional satellites in a very small package. The
satellites include a cold gas microthruster, and miniaturized
telemetry/command and power systems.

The Orbital Sciences L-1011 Stargazer carrier aircraft took off
from RW30/12 at Vandenberg on Mar 22 at 1304 UTC. The Pegasus rocket
was dropped from the aircraft at 1403 UTC over approximately 123W 36N.
At 1409 UTC the vehicle reached a 301 x 4568 km x 105.6 deg polar orbit.
A special dispenser ejected the three satellites.

Venus Express
--------------

ESA's Venus Express arrived in orbit around Venus on Apr 11. The
53-minute orbit insertion burn begain at 0710 UTC and left VEx in a
highly elliptical polar orbit around Venus with an apoapsis of 350000
km. Orbit lowering is in progress; as of the final main engine burn
scheduled for  Apr 23 the orbit was expected to be 257 x 70463 km.

JCSAT-9
-------

On Apr 12 Sea Launch orbited the JCSAT-9 communications satellite using
a Zenit-3SL rocket. JCSAT-9, built by Lockheed Martin using an A2100AX
bus, will provide comms services for the Japanese JSAT company. The
satellite was placed in an initial 1710 x  35667 km x 0.04 deg orbit.
By Apr 23 it was in a 35664 x 35769 km x 0.03 deg orbit drifting
over 130 deg E.

FORMOSAT-3
----------

The US-Taiwanese FORMOSAT-3 mission was launched on Apr 15 by a Orbital
Sciences Minotaur from Vandenberg Air Force Base. FORMOSAT-3 consists of
six small 62 kg Orbcomm-type satellites with GPS receivers which will measure
atmospheric conditions by studying the effect of the atmosphere on GPS
satellite signals passing through it. The satellites, also known as
COSMIC (Constellation Observing System for Meteorology, Ionosphere and
Climate), will eventually be positioned in equally spaced orbit planes
at around 800 km altitude. Initial orbits were around 500 x 540 km x 72
deg.

EROS B
------

A new 290 kg satellite for the Israeli ImageSat company (incorporated in the
Cayman Is.) was launched on Apr 25 by a Russian Start-1 solid launch
vehicle from the far Eastern launch base at Svobodniy into a 503 x 513 km
x 97.3 deg orbit.

Astra 1KR
---------

Lockheed Martin launched an Atlas V 411, serial AV-008, from Cape
Canaveral on Apr 20. The unusual long first Centaur burn went to a 167 x
22442 km x 24.8 deg transfer orbit, followed by  a second burn to 6470 x
36240 km x 23.8 deg. The payload, a Lockheed Martin A2100 Ku-band comms
satellite for SES Astra, will use its own propulsion to head for
geostationary orbit.

Note:  The Dawn mission (JSR 562) has now been uncancelled...

Station
-------

The Expedition 13 crew made a spacewalk on Jun 1. Vinogradov wore
spacesuit Orlan-M No. 25 and Williams wore Orlan-M No. 26. The  Pirs
module was depressurized by 2226 UTC and the hatch was opened  at 2248
UTC, with the astronauts outside by 2300 UTC. On the Zvezda module, the
crew installed a vent valve for the Elektron oxygen system, cleared an
obstruction on the WAL-2 antenna, and retrieved the Kromka and Biorisk
experiments. On the station truss, they replaced a camera on the  Mobile
Base System. The astronauts returned to Pirs at 0510 UTC, closed the
hatch at 0519 UTC and repressurized the airlock at 0521 UTC, for a
duration of 6h 55m (depress/repress) or 6h 31m (hatch open/close). There
were two pieces of debris released during the spacewalk, a cleaning
towel jettisoned by Vinogradov at 0136 UTC and an APFR adapter which
came loose from the Strela boom at 0238 UTC. 

Meanwhile, Space Shuttle orbiter 103 (Discovery) is on the launch
pad at Kennedy Space Center being prepared for a July 1 launch
on mission STS-121.

GOES N
------

The GOES N (Goestationary Operational Environmental Satellite)
weather satellite was launched on May 24 by a Boeing Delta 4M+(4,2)
from Cape Canaveral. The spacecraft entered a 6656 x 35173 km x 12.0 deg
transfer orbit. This was the fifth Delta 4 launch. By Jun 1,
GOES N was in a 33570 x 35168 km x 0.3 deg orbit approaching the
geosynchronous belt.

The GOES satellites are operated by NOAA, the US weather bureau. GOES N
carries weather imager and sounder instruments, a space environment
monitor, and a soft X-ray solar imaging telescope. Mass is 1543 kg
empty, 3209 kg fuelled; the bus is based on the Boeing 601 and uses the
R-4D liquid apogee engine. It joins GOES 10 (operating as GOES-WEST),
GOES 12 (operating as GOES-EAST) and GOES 11 (standby, will replace
GOES-10 on Jun 27). GOES N will become GOES 13 when it becomes
operational.

KOMPAS-2
----------

COMPASS-2 (KOMPAS-2),  an earthquake research satellite for the
Moscow-based IZMIRAN science institute, was launched on May 26 into a
399 x 494 km x 78.9 deg orbit. It marked the second launch into orbit
from a submarine. The 80 kg satellite carries detectors for electrons,
UHF/VHF waves, UV emission and radiation, a radio frequency analyser for
electric field waves, and a Mayak ionospheric beacon. The satellite was
developed by the Makeev KB.

The launch platform was the submarine K-84 'Ekaterinburg' in the Barents
Sea.  Initially the payload was tracked in  the US as object 2006-19C,
with 19A is probably the nose cone/third stage, which is the largest
object in orbit, and 19B the conical payload capsule. On Jun 2 the 19A
and 19C assignments were changed.


The Shtil' rocket, based on the R-29RM missile, has an unusual launch
profile. After its undersea launch, the first two stages burn and
separate. The third stage is integrated with the nose cone and the
post-boost low thrust targeting engine. In the military version, several
conical reentry vehicles hang pointing backwards from the nose cone. For
Shtil', one of these reentry vehicles is used, containing the payload
instead of a nuclear warhead. After third stage burn, the heavy stage 3
rocket engine is ejected onto a mildly suborbital trajectory (about
-1500 x 400 km) and hits the Pacific Ocean about 23 minutes after
launch. The rest of the third stage remains with the nose cone, which
uses its post-boost engine to increase velocity by around 700 m/s  and
place itself in orbit. The payload capsule then separates, and itself
ejects the payload. For the earlier TUBSAT launch the base of the
conical payload capsule was ejected as a separate object, but for Kompas
this may remain attached to the satellite.

Reports indicate that the Kompas-2 satellite is not responding
to ground commands and that its mission will be abandoned.
COMPASS stands for Complex Orbital Magneto-Plasma Autonomous Small Satellite;
in Russian it's referred to as Kompas.

Ariane L529
-----------

Arianespace launched Flight V171 on May 27 with rocket L529, a
heavy-life Ariane 5ECA model. The payloads were Satmex 6 for Satelites
Mexicanos SA de CV, and Shin Satellite's Thaicom 5. Satmex 6 is a Loral
1300X satellite with a mass of 2310 kg (5456 kg when fuelled) and a
hybrid C-band and Ku-band telecom payload for telecom and internet
service in Mexico and the rest of North and Latin America. Thaicom 5 is
an Alcatel Alenia Space Spacebus 3000A with a mass of 1220 kg (2766 kg
when fully fuelled) for C/Ku-band telecom and TV transmission in the
Asia-Pacific Region. It will replace Thaicom 3. The satellites were
delivered to a 251 x 35688 km x 7.0 deg geostationary transfer orbit.

Resurs-DK
---------

Russia launched the Resurs-DK civilian remote sensing satellite by
Soyuz-U on Jun 15 into a 70-degree low Earth orbit.  Resurs-DK No. 1
carries a one-meter-resolution-class imager and relays its data to the
ground via a digital link. It is based on the Terilen/Neman class
reconnaissance satellite in use since the 1980s, using the Yantar'
satellite bus. Resurs-DK was built by the TsSKB-Progress company in
Samara, which also designed and produced the original Yantar' satellites
-  although some more recent Yantar' military production models are the
responsibility of the Arsenal factory in Sankt-Peterburg.

Station
-------

The Progress M-55 cargo ship undocked from the Pirs module at 1406 UTC
on Jun 19. It fired its engines at 1706 UTC to lower its orbit into
the atmosphere, and reentered at 1741 UTC over the Pacific.

Progress M-56 remains docked at the Zvezda module, with Soyuz TMA-8
docked at Zarya.

Progress M-57 was launched from Baykonur on Jun 24. With the spacecraft factory 
number 7K-TGM No. 357, the Progress M-57 is flying Space Station mission 22P
to deliver cargo to the ISS. (NASA sloppily refers to it as "Progress 22",
but this isn't a designation the Russians use.) M-57 docked at the Pirs
port freed up by M-55 at 1625 UTC on Jun 26.

On Jun 22, the Space Station was in a 335 x 349 km x 51.6 deg orbit.

MITEX
-----

A secret US DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) mission was
launched by a Boeing Delta 7925 on Jun 21. The Delta entered a 167 x 248
km x 28.4 deg parking orbit; the second stage's second burn raised this
to 170 x 2213 km x 27.9 deg. The spinning PAM-D third stage, with its
ATK Star 48 solid motor, fired to reach a (planned) 185 x 36221 km x
25.2 deg orbit. After a five-minute wait to allow residual exhaust to
die down, the stage released two despin weights to take away angular
momentum and then separated from the MITEX payload.

MITEX, the Microsatellite Technology Experiment project, consists of
three spacecraft. Two of them are small 250-kg-class satellites, one
built by Orbital Sciences (OSC) and the other by Lockheed Martin (LM).
The third is an advanced liquid propellant upper stage developed by the
Naval Research Lab (NRL). The NRL stage has a 400-N thruster and,
unusually, solar panels, allowing the stage to operate for an extended
time and deliver multiple payloads to different orbits. On this mission,
the NRL stage will deliver the OSC and LM satellites to geostationary
orbit, where they will carry out a number of maneuvers. Observers
speculate that the small satellites are prototypes for inspector
spacecraft which could rendezvous with and take closeup images of other
geostationary satellites. The NRL stage may have some heritage from the
TLD (Titan Launch Dispenser) stage used to deploy low-orbit  Navy
surveillance satellites in the 1990s. The USAF IABS (Integral Apogee
Boost System) apogee stage used for DSCS satellites in the 1990s also
had solar panels, but it's an unusual approach for geostationary
satellite delivery - most geo satellites use internal propulsion systems
rather than an external stage for orbit changes after the first few
hours of flight.

The three satellites have been given the cover names USA 187, 188 and 189.
It's not known which number applies to which payload, although I'm guessing
that USA 189 is the NRL stage.

KazSat
------

Kazakhstan's first satellite is in orbit. Kazakhstan purchased the
KazSat satellite from the Russian space company Krunichev, which also
launched it using its Proton-K rocket from the Russian-operated Baykonur
launch site in Kazakhstan. At 2253 UTC on Jun 17  the Proton-K put
KazSat in low orbit attached to an Energiya Blok-DM3 upper stage. The DM
fired at 2358 UTC into geostationary transfer orbit, and then again at
apogee (0509 UTC Jun 18)  to deliver KazSat into geostationary orbit.
According to tsenki.com the mass of KazSat is 1725 kg although some
other sources quote a lower mass. KazSat was drifting in a 35384 x 35781
km x 0.0 deg orbit over 102E as of Jun 22.

Galaxy 16
---------

Panamsat's Galaxy 16 communications satellite was launched by a Sea
Launch Zenit-3SL on Jun 18. The Loral LS-1300 satellite has a launch
mass of 4640 kg and carries C and Ku band transponders. By Jun 22
Galaxy 16's initial orbit of 2272 x 35647 km x 0.1 deg had been
raised to 33579 x 35617 km x 0.2 deg, approaching the geostationary
region.


Resurs-DK
---------

Russia's new civilian imaging satelite has begun operations with its
Geoton-1 camera payload. Resurs-DK's initial orbit was 193 x 339 km x
70.0 deg. On Jun 18 the orbit was raised to 355 x 585 km x 69.9 deg;
this operational orbit has a much higher perigee than the military
Yantar'-class satellites on which Resurs-DK is based.

Kosmos-2421
-----------

A Russian Navy US-PU satellite for ocean electronic surveillance
was launched from Baykonur on Jun 25 and codenamed Kosmos-2421.
The Tsiklon-2 rocket put it in an approximately 100 x 400 km transfer
orbit, and the US-PU onboard engine performed the insertion burn
to a 405 x 415 km x 65.0 deg operational orbit.


GOES N
------

NOAA renamed the GOES N weather satellite  as GOES 13 on Jun 4. The
satellite has now been transferred from Boeing to the GOES control
center at NOAA-Suitland, where it will be tested by NASA for several
months before NOAA takes over regular operations. (Traditionally, NOAA
satellites are given a letter before launch and a number after they
reach operational status. NASA used to use a similar scheme).
On Jun 21, GOES 13 was in a 35780 x 35790 km x 0.5 deg orbit
over 89.4W.

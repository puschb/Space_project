Shuttle and Station
--------------------

Space Shuttle Discovery took off from Launch Complex 39B at 1837:55 UTC
on Jul 4, on mission STS-121. The OMS-2 burn at 1915 UTC put Discovery
in a 155 x 253 km x 51.6 deg orbit, while ET-119 fell back to Earth in
its 56 x 230 km x 51.6 deg trans-atmospheric orbit and reentered over
the Pacific at about 1950 UTC. Discovery completed its rendezvous with
the International Space Station on Jul 6 and docked with the
PMA-2 adapter on the Destiny module at 1452 UTC.

Following the loss of Columbia on mission STS-107 in Jan 2003, the
Shuttle's External Tank was redesigned to reduce the amount of thermal
protection foam that falls off during ascent, and methods were developed
to fix any damage to the Orbiter's thermal protection system due to foam
hits. The loss of OV-102 Columbia was due to damage to the RCC leading
edge panels of its left wing caused by foam from External Tank ET-93.
Orbiter OV-103 Discovery then flew on mission STS-114 in July 2005, but
to general consternation it turned out that its tank, ET-121, lost
larger pieces of foam than expected. The Shuttle stood down again and
the future of the program is riding on the new mission, STS-121.
Early look data seems good: no significant foam loss in the lower
atmosphere part of the flight.

Orbiter OV-103 Discovery is using tank ET-119 and solid motors RSRM-93.
In the payload bay, the cargo is:

 Location       Cargo                            Mass
 Bay 1-2        Orbiter Docking System           1800 kg?
 Bay 4S?        APC with SPDU?                     20 kg?
 Bay 5-6        Integrated Cargo Carrier (ICC)   1500 kg?
                Keel Yoke Device (KYD)
                TUS/RA, EATCS-PM, FGB
 Bay 7S?        ROEU?                              20 kg?
 Bay 7-12       Leonardo (MPLM-1)                9500 kg
 Bay 13         LMC, DTO 848                      954 kg
 Sill           OBSS 202                          450 kg?
 Sill           RMS 303                           390 kg
 --------------------------------------------------------
 Total cargo:                                   14594 kg?
 Note: NASA uses a different definition of "cargo".
 Note: OBSS serial number from Bill Harwood's page,
       http://www.cbsnews.com/network/news/space/current.html
 Note: There are probably a couple of APC sidewall carriers
       with SPDU power distribution units and suchlike, but they don't appear
       on recent cargo diagrams I've seen.


The LMC (Lightweight MPESS Carrier) carries the DTO 848 thermal
protection system repair kit demo; the ICC carries the TUS (Trailing
Umbilical System) for the ISS Mobile Transporter repair, as well as the
EATCS-PM pump module for the ISS truss, and a fixed grapple bar. The
Multipurpose Logistics Module, Leonardo, carries the MELFI freezer rack,
the Express Transportation Rack with the EMCS (European Modular
Cultivation System) and the OGS oxygen generation system rack, as well
as 3 RSR (Resupply Stowage Rack) and 5 RSP (Resupply Stowage Platform).
The ROEU (Remotely Operated Electrical Umbilical) on the payload bay
sidewall provides power to the MPLM. The MEPSI picosatellite deployer
originally meant to fly on STS-121 appears to have been reassigned to
another launch.

STS-121 will dock with the Station at PMA-2. Crew of Discovery are
Steven Lindsey (CDR), Mark E. Kelly (Pilot), Michael Fossum (MS1), Lisa
Nowak (MS2), Stephanie Wilson (MS3) and Piers Sellers (MS4), all from
NASA. ESA astronaut Thomas Reiter (MS5) is flying as part of the
Expedition 13 crew and is expected to remain aboard the Station
with Vinogradov and Williams.



Ares
----

NASA has announced that the Crew Launch Vehicle, being developed on the
basis of the Shuttle SRB to launch the next NASA human-carrying
spaceship, will be called the Ares I. The planned heavy-lift followon
will be called the Ares V.


NROL-22
-------

A Boeing Delta 4 was launched from Space Launch Complex 6 at Vandenberg
AFB in California on Jun 28 carrying a secret payload for the National
Reconnaissance Office. The launch was codenamed NROL-22 and the
satellite received the designation USA 184, held over from last year.

The intended orbit is an elliptical 12-hour orbit with an inclination of
63 degrees; NRO data relay and signals intelligence satellites have used
this orbit in the past. I suspect this payload is likely to be one of
the signals intelligence series that began with the JUMPSEAT satellites
in 1971.  Aviation Week, on the other hand, thinks that it's a Satellite
Data System data relay satellite. At the moment, I don't think there's
compelling evidence either way.

NROL-22 probably also carries NASA's TWINS-A science payload which
carries neutral atom imagers to map the Earth's magnetosphere.
It may also have an additional USAF SBIRS-HEO test payload. SBIRS-HEO is
the highly elliptical orbit component of the new Space-Based Infrared
missile early warning satellite system that will replace the old DSP
satellites. The HEO-1 payload was delivered to the USAF in 2004
which is consistent with a launch on this mission, originally scheduled
to go up in early 2005.

HST
---

The Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) was
reactivated on Jun 30 after being out of action since Jun 19. Failure of
ACS would have been a blow to the telescope, whose main spectrograph has
also failed. A Shuttle servicing mission to HST hangs in the balance
with the forthcoming test flight of Discovery on mission STS-121.

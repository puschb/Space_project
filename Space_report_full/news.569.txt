Shuttle and Station
--------------------


The ISS Expedition 13 crew on board the station now consists of Pavel
Vingradov, Jeffrey Williams, and ESA's Thomas Reiter.

On Aug 3 Williams and Reiter made a spacewalk from the Quest module to
install a Floating Potential Measurement Unit on the S1 truss to measure
spacecraft charging, and to perform other maintenance tasks on S1. 
Willaims wore US EMU spacesuit 3008 and Reiter wore suit 3015 (thanks
to Andrey Krasil'nikov for this information). The
airlock was depressurized at 1350 UTC, with the hatch open at 1354 UTC.
It took some time to get the hatch fully open, and the astronauts put
their suits on battery power at 1404 UTC, leaving the airlock by 1425
UTC. All tasks completed, they went back inside and closed the hatch at
around 1950 UTC, with airlock repressurization beginning at 1958 UTC.


Kosmos-2422
-----------

Russia has launched a new missile early warning satellite in the Oko
series. The Molniya-M rocket put Kosmos-2422 in a highly  elliptical
orbit. The Oko satellites are built by the Lavochkin company.
Kosmos-2422 was in an initial 533 x 39135 km x 62.9 deg orbit; on Jul 31
it maneuvered to a 539 x 39570 km orbit.

Dnepr
-----

Kosmotras launched a Dnepr rocket from Baykonur on Jul 26,
carrying a large number of small satellites. The rocket was
destroyed when the first stage engine failed.

The 750 kg BelKA satellite was the first owned by Belarus; it was
built in Russia by Energiya using the Viktoria (Yamal) bus and
carried a 2.5m resolution pan camera and a 10m resolution multispectral
camera for Earth observation.

The 12 kg Unisat-4 is a technology satellite from the Universita di Roma
"La Sapienza". It carried cameras, a GPS nav experiment and
an aerodynamic reentry device experiment.

The 92 kg Baumanets is a student satellite from the MGTU  (Moskovskiy
Gosudarstvenniy Tekhnicheskiy Universitet) im. N.E. Baumann, the Bauman
Moscow State Technical University. It carried an Earth imager and
an amateur radio link.

PICPOT (Piccolo Cubo del Politecnico di Torino) is a small 2 kg, 0.15m cube
satellite from the Politecnico di Torino. It carried an Earth imager.

The vehicle carried five P-POD picosatellite deployers each with
three cubesats of 1 kg mass, 0.1m size. (ION is the exception, consisting
of a double cubesat 2 kg, 0.1 x 0.2m).

P-POD 1 carried Arizona SACRED and the University of Illinois ION.
P-POD 2 carried Arizona RINCON, Cornell ICECube-1, and Kansas KUTESat Pathfinder.
P-POD 3 carried Nihon University/Japan SEEDS, Norway nCube and S. Korea HAUSAT-1.
P-POD 4 carried Montana MEROPE, Cal Poly CP2, and AerospaceCorp. AeroCube-1.
P-POD 5 carried CalPoly CP1, Hawaii Voyager and Cornell ICECube-2.



Kompsat-2
----------

South Korea's Kompsat-2 (also called Arirang-2) was placed in a 679 x 
701 km x 98.1 deg polar orbit on Jul 28 by a Krunichev Rokot vehicle
launched from Plesetsk. It carries a 1-meter-resolution Earth imager.
After its fuel depletion burn, the Briz upper stage ended up in a
504 x 699 km x 98.2 deg orbit. 


Hot Bird 8
----------

The Briz-M upper stage returned to flight on Aug 4. The Krunichev/ILS
Proton-M/Briz-M put Eutelsat's Hot Bird 8 in geostationary transfer
orbit. The 4875 kg Astrium-built Eurostar 3000 satellite carries a
Ku-band communications payload for the French-based Eutelsat SA company.

The Proton-M put its payload section in a -932 x 163 km x 51.5 deg
sub-orbit at 9 min after launch. While the Proton-M third stage fell
back toward the Pacific, the Briz-M first burn raised this to a 173 x
173 km x 51.5 deg parking orbit at 2206 UTC. The second burn finished at
2313 UTC in a 258 x 5000 km x 50.3 deg orbit, and following a 2 hour
coast and a third burn the Briz-M DTB prop tank seperated at 0129 UTC on
Aug 5 into a 316 x 16438 km x 49.5 deg orbit, immediately followed by a
fourth Briz-M burn to a 414 x 35834 km x 49.1 deg standard Proton-style
geostationary transfer orbit. A fifth burn at 0640 UTC raised the
perigee and lowered the inclination, with Briz-M and Hot Bird separating
at 0659 UTC into a 3857 x 38504 km x 13.0 deg orbit. Hot Bird will use
its Aerojet-Redmond R-4D bipropellant engine to raise its orbit to
geostationary. (Trajectory data is mostly from coopi.krunichev.ru).

Ariane 5
--------

On Aug 11 Arianespace launched Ariane 5ECA vehicle L531 on flight V172
from the Kourou launch base. The two EAP solid boosters separated 2 min
after launch; the EPC core stage separated at 9 min into a -1163 x 167
km x 6.2 deg sub-orbit. The ESC-A cryogenic upper stage then burned from
T+9min to T+24min, reaching geostationary transfer orbit. Two satellites
were placed in orbit: in the upper position was JCSAT-10, a Lockheed
Martin A2100AX Ku/C-band television broadcasting satellite for the
Japanese JSAT Corp. Its mass is 1858 kg dry, 4048 kg fuelled.
Below the Sylda 5A adapter was Syracuse 3B, an Alcatel Alenia Space
model Spacebus 4000B3 satellite with a mass of 1658 kg dry, 3750 kg fuelled,
which will provide SHF and EHF military communications links for the French
military. Syracuse 3B is operated by the Delegation Generale pour l'Armement.

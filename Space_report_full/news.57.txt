Jonathan's Space Report

Oct 23 1990 (no.57)
----------------------------------------------------

Tanking tests on Atlantis and Columbia are set for the next week. 
Discovery is in the orbiter processing facility.  Launch of Atlantis is
expected around Nov 10 with the AFP-658 recon satellite. 

Gennadiy Manakov and Gennadiy Strekalov continue in orbit aboard the
Mir/Kvant/Kvant-2/Kristall/Soyuz TM-10/Progress M-5 complex. The
spacewalk has been delayed to Oct 30 because Strekalov has a cold.

Pioneer 11, in the outer solar system, is experiencing
communications difficulties.

The Kosmos-2102 recon satellite began a 2 month mission on Oct 16,
in a 184x338 km orbit at 62.8 degrees inclination.


BOOK PLUG:***:

 "The Soviet Cosmonaut Team" by Gordon Hooper. Available
from GRH Publications, 2 Wayne Close, Gunton 2001, LOWESTOFT,
Suffolk NR32 4SX, England. 2 vols, paperback, 22 pounds sterling
for sea mail, about 35 pounds sterling for airmail. (01144 502 508585)

This book gives complete biographies of all the Soviet cosmonauts
and cosmonaut trainees, updated to July 1990. It includes discussions
of how the cosmonauts were trained, missions that were planned but 
never flew, details of previously unknown cosmonaut trainees. Quality
and accuracy are excellent throughout. Another example of the fine
work done by the British Interplanetary Society's Soviet space analysts.
Disclaimer: I have no connection with Gordon Hooper or GRH Pubs., I
just think its a good book.

Since news is light this week, here's a summary of the current
Soviet cosmonaut team, with selection dates, drawn from Hooper's book
and from Soviet sources: [This list may be incomplete; and I have omitted
cosmonauts who are still officially attached to the team although no longer 
eligible for flights. The 1965 engineers who have not yet flown must
be somewhat unlikely to get a chance now, in their fifties.]

Shuttle and Station
--------------------

The Station now has a new set of solar arrays, and is hosting
a new crew and a visiting tourist.

Atlantis docked with the Station at 1048 UTC on Sep 11. The Shuttle RMS
grappled the P3/P4 solar array truss assembly and unberthed it. At 1452
UTC the Station arm grappled the P3/P4 and  at 1503 UTC it was released
by the Shuttle arm. P3/P4 was connected to the P1 truss at 0727 UTC on
Sep 12, with the bolts tight by 0835. On Sep 12, astronauts Tanner and
Stefanyshyn-Piper made the first spacewalk of the flight, EVA-1. They
begain activation of the P3/P4. On Sep 13, Burbank and MacLean made
EVA-2, continuing to prepare P3/P4 for use. The solar array wings were
deployed on Sep 14. On Sep 15, Tanner and Stefanyshyn-Piper made their
third spacewalk to complete work with P3/P4, deploying a radiator, and
replacing an S-band antenna assembly elsewhere on the truss. The airlock
was repressurized at 1643 UTC.

The Shuttle undocked from the Station's PMA-2 port at 1250 UTC on Sep
20.  Atlantis landed safely at Kennedy Space Center's runway 33 on Sep
21 at 1021 UTC after a one-day delay due to weather and concerns over a
debris object which was probably a plastic tile shim. The deorbit burn
was at 0914 UTC.

The Progress M-56 cargo ship undocked from Zvezda at 0028 UTC
on Sep 19. It was later deorbited over the Pacific. Progress M-57
and Soyuz TMA-8 remain docked to the Station.

Soyuz TMA-9 was launched from Baykonur on Sep 18, carrying the
Expedition 14 crew of Mikhail Tyurin and Mike Lopez-Alegria, as well as
spaceflight participant (tourist) Anousheh Ansari. TMA-9 docked with
Station at 0521 UTC on Sep 20, linking up with the aft port of Zvezda.
Ansari is well known as an advocate of spaceflight; she donated millions
of dollars to fund the Ansari X-Prize won by Burt Rutan's Spaceship One.

IGS
---

The Japanese space agency JAXA launched its Information Gathering
Satellite Optical-2 spy satellite on Sep 11. The satellite will replace
IGS O-1 launched in 2003 Mar and an earlier IGS O-2 lost in a launch
failure in 2003 Nov. As best I can gather from the JAXA website and the
wonders of Babelfish, the replacement is being called Optical-2 and not
Optical-3.  The launch vehicle was an H2A - but I'm not sure which
version. It is probably the light H2A 202 version with no small
strapons, and the small 4S fairing. The replacement Radar-2 will be
launched separately; on earlier launches the Optical and Radar
satellites shared the same launch vehicle. Optical-2 is in
an orbit of approximately 460 x 484 km x 97.2 deg.

ZX-22A
------

China launched the Zhongxing-22A satellite from Xichang on Sep 12 into a
202 x 41817 km x 25.0 deg transfer orbit. The ZX-22A is thought to be a
military communications satellite. It will replace ZX-22, launched in
2000, at the 98.0E longitude location. 

Kosmos-2423
-----------

Kosmos-2423, a Don-class imaging satellite for the Russian Defense Ministry,
was launched from Baykonur on Sep 14 into an initial 170 x 317 km x 64.9 deg
orbit.

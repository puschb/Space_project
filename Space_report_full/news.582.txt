Shuttle and Station
-------------------

Yurchikin, Kotov and Anderson continue the Expedition 15 mission
on board the Station.

OV-104 Atlantis was mounted on one of the Boeing 747 Shuttle Carrier
Aircraft (SCA), NASA 905, at Dryden Flight Research Center, for
transport back to Kennedy Space Center in Florida. NASA 905 took off
from Edwards AFB Runway 22 at 1304 UTC on Jul 1 and landed around 1546
UTC at Amarillo, Texas. Later that day it flew onward to Offutt
Air Force Base in Nebraska (info from nasaspaceflight.com). On Jul
2 the SCA continued to Ft Campbell, Kentucky and on Jul 3 returned
to the Shuttle Landing Facility at Kennedy Space Center. By Jul 4
Atlantis was in the Orbiter Processing Facility, while in the Vehicle
Assembly Building Endeavour was being mated to external tank ET-117
and the RSRM-97 solid boosters in preparation for the August launch
of STS-118.


Yaogan 2
--------

The Chinese Yaogan remote sensing satellites are something of a mystery.
They are rumoured to carry SAR (synthetic aperture radar) and be at
least partly for military surveillance applications. The first
Yaogan was launched on a three-stage CZ-4 in 2006; the final stage
ended up in a 452 x 624 km orbit, while Yaogan was tracked in a
601 x 621 km orbit that was raised over a few days to 623 x 626 km.
It's not clear whether Yaogan entered the final-stage orbit first
and raised its own perigee, or whether (more likely?) it was deployed
in the 601 x 621 km orbit, and the final stage then made a depletion
burn to drop its. 

Yaogan 2, launched this year on a two-stage CZ-2D, entered a 631 x 655
km orbit and does not appear to have made any significant maneuvers. No
other object from the launch has been cataloged by US sensors - what
happened to the CZ-2D second stage? Did Yaogan 2 perform orbit insertion
with an onboard engine leaving the second stage in a suborbital trajectory?
Did the second stage remain attached to the Yaogan 2 payload, either
deliberately or as a result of a separation failure? Did the second
stage make a major depletion burn that removed it from orbit? (This
would be unprecedented for the CZ-2D, but would be a welcome innovation).
It will be interesting to follow this and later Yaogan missions and
see if a pattern emerges.

Kosmos-2427
-----------

Russia's Kobal't-M imaging satellite Kosmos-2427 was launched into a 167
x 339 km x 67.1 deg orbit on Jun 7. It raised the orbit on Jun 11 to 182
x 354 km; the orbit then slowly decayed until Jun 19, when it was
lowered slightly  from 179 x 335 km to 175 x 325 km. On Jun 28 the orbit
was boosted to 183 x 348 km, and on Jul 5 to 169 x 375 km.

Genesis-2
----------

Bigelow Aerospace's Genesis-2 spacecraft was launched into orbit on Jun
28 by a Dnepr rocket from the Yasniy spaceport in Russia, at the former
Dombarovskiy ICBM base. Jim Oberg reports that silo 1-1 was used.
Genesis-2 inflated from an initial diameter of 1.8m to 2.5m and deployed
4 solar panels; the pressurized vehicle is a 1/3 scale model of a
proposed space station module. The spacecraft is in a 555 x 562 km x
64.5 deg orbit. As is normal with Dnepr launches, the nose fairing ended
up in a higher 545 x 1792 km x 64.5 deg trajectory.

Kosmos-2428
-----------

Russia launched a Tselina-2 electronic intelligence satellite on
Jun 29 from Baykonur into a 846 x 856 km x 71.0 deg orbit.
The Tselina-2 satellites are built by the Ukranian company Yuzhnoye,
as is the Zenit-2M rocket used to launch it. This was the first launch
of the Zenit-2M, an improved version of the Zenit-2. The rocket was upgraded
using components developed for the Sea Launch/Land Launch program.
The second stage of the Zenit-2 uses four small motors to separate from
its payload; the covers of these motors are ejected into a higher orbit
of 850 x 1150 km.

Catalog 29676 and others
--------------------------

For some strange reason or administrative oversight, Space Command
catalog number 29676 has still not been assigned, even though 
the catalog is otherwise complete up to number 31799. It was briefly
assigned to 2006-61B, a piece from the Meridian 1 launch, but then
removed. Numbers  26743 and 26861 are also vacant.

SAR-Lupe 2
----------

Germany's second SAR-Lupe radar reconnaissance satellite
was launched on Jul 2 by a Russian Kosmos-3M rocket from Plesetsk
into a 469 x 507 km x 98.2 deg orbit.


DirecTV 10
----------

The DirecTV 10 Ka-band television broadcasting satellite, a Boeing 702
model, was launched  by a Krunichev Proton-M on July 7. The Briz-M
stage's first three burns took it from -397 x 174 km to 173 x 173 km
to 257 x 5000 km to 315 x 14190 km. The Briz-M stage
drop tank was left in a 315 x 14190 km x 46 deg orbit; DirecTV was in a
414 x 35812 km x 45 deg geostationary transfer orbit by 0501 UTC, with a
further burn at 1004 UTC placing it in a 4898 x 35786 km x 21.36 deg
orbit. At this point the Briz-M separated, leaving the satellite's
own propulsion to take it to geostationary orbit.

Zhongxing 6B
------------

Chinasat's new ZX-6B satellite, a Thales Alenia Spacebus 4000,
was launched by a CZ-3B on Jul 4 into a 233 x 49721 km x 24.2 deg
transfer orbit.

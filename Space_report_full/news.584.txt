Shuttle and Station
-------------------

Yurchikin, Kotov and Anderson continue the Expedition 15 mission on
board the Station. The Progress M-61 cargo ship docked with the Pirs
module at 1840 UTC on Aug 5.

Space Shuttle Endeavour was launched on Aug 8 at 2236 UTC.
The STS-118 stack comprised Orbiter OV-105, solid rockets RSRM-97
and external tank ET-117. The solid boosters separated 2 min after launch.
At 2245 UTC the orbiter main engines cut off and ET-117 separated into
an approximately 57 x 225 km x 51.6 deg orbit. The OMS-2 burn at 2313 UTC
put Endeavour in a higher 229 x 317 km orbit as the ET fell back to reentry
around 2346 UTC.

Crew of STS-118 are Scott Kelly, Charles Hobaugh, Tracy Caldwell,  Rick
Mastracchio, Dafydd Williams, Barbara Morgan, and Al Drew.

Here is my estimated cargo bay manifest for STS-118:

                           Bay      Mass (kg)
 Orbiter Docking System    1-2      1800
  EMU 3010                           130?
  EMU 3017                           130?
 Tunnel Adapter              3       112     
 Spacehab-SM               5-7      5480?
 SPDU                        8P         ?
 S5 Truss                  8-10     1584
 ESP-3                    11-12     3400
  CMG-3R ORU              11-12      540?
 OBSS                     Sill       450?
 RMS 201                  Sill       410?
-----------------------------------------
 Total                             14036 kg

The Spacehab Single Module carries research equipment and supplies for
the Station. The SPDU (Station Power Distribution Unit) lets the Orbiter
run off Station electricity during its stay, allowing a longer mission.
The S5 truss will be installed on the end of S4, as a short spacer so
that when S6 is added later, the S6 solar panels won't hit the S4 ones.
The ESP-3 (External Stowage Platform 3) carries a spare nitrogen tank
(NTA) for the truss cooling system,  a spare  truss  battery
charge/discharge unit (BCDU), a spare Canadarm-2 robot arm pitch roll
joint, and a replacement Control Moment Gyro for the Z1 truss.

Endeavour docked at the PMA-2 adapter on the Station at 1802 UTC on Aug
10 and the hatches to the Station were opened at 2004 UTC. The Shuttle
Canadarm (RMS 201) lifted the S5 truss from the payload bay at 2050 UTC
on Aug 10, and later handed it to the Station's Canadarm-2 which
attached it to the main truss at 1730 UTC on Aug 11. Mastracchio and
Williams began the first spacewalk of the mission on Aug 11 from the
Quest airlock using suits EMU 3010 and 3017 respectively. The airlock
was depressurized  by around 1624 UTC with hatch open at 1628 UTC; the
astronauts supervised the S5 attachment process and completed fitting it
out; they then monitored the retraction of a thermal radiator on the P6
truss at 2128 UTC, closed the hatch at 2241 UTC and repressurized the
airlock at 2245 UTC. 

On Aug 13 they went outside again, with airlock depress at about 1526
UTC and hatch open at 1529 UTC. During the spacewalk they replaced
CMG-3, one of the gyroscopes in the Z1 truss segment. At 1626 UTC they
removed it from Z1 and stowed it on a temporary bracket. At around 1735
UTC they unberthed the new CMG and its frame from the ESP-3 platform in
the rear of the payload bay, installing it on the ESP-2 platform next to
the Quest airlock at 1822.  Then, the new CMG was removed from its frame
at 1851 UTC and installed in Z1 at 1926 UTC. Next, the old CMG was
carried to ESP-2 and placed in the empty frame. The hatch was closed at
2157 UTC with repressurization at 2200 UTC. On Aug 14, ESP-3 was
unberthed from Endeavour's payload bay and attached to the P3 truss on
the Station, where its spare parts can be reached if needed.  

EVA-3 by Richard Mastracchio and Clay Anderson 
was on Aug 15, with airlock depress at 1434 UTC and hatch open at
1436 UTC. The SASA antenna was relocated from P6 to P1, and the two
CETA carts were moved from S1 to P1. At 1850 UTC Mastracchio discovered
minor damage on his spacesuit glove, and the spacewalk was cut short.
He returned to the airlock at 1855 UTC, with Anderson completing some
tasks and returning at 1951 UTC. The hatch was closed at 2000 UTC
and the airlock was repressurized at 2005 UTC. Anderson used EMU 3008,
which is based on ISS in the Quest airlock.

EVA-4 by Williams and Anderson began with Quest depressurization
at 1314 UTC on Aug 18 and hatch opening at 1316 UTC and concluded
with hatch closure at 1814 UTC and repressurization at 1819 UTC.
The astronauts retrieved two MISSE exposure packs and installed
an EWIS communications antenna on Destiny. They also installed mounting
brackets for the OBSS (Orbiter Boom Sensor System) on the S1 truss.
The OBSS will be left at S1 after STS-123 so that STS-124 can use it
without having to carry it up (no room in the payload bay).

A small gouge on a tile underneath the Orbiter caused some concern
during the mission, but it was decided that a repair spacewalk
is not required. The Shuttle crew returned to Endeavour on Aug 18
and undocked on Aug 19 at 1156 UTC. Landing is scheduled for Aug 21.


Ariane 
------

An Ariane 5ECA rocket launched from Kourou on Aug 14 placed the Spaceway
3 and BSAT-3a satellites in orbit. Spaceway 3 is a 6075 kg full, 3655 kg
dry Boeing 702 satellite for Hughes Network Systems, with a Ka-band
payload for internet distribution. BSAT-3A is a 1967 kg full, 930 kg dry
Lockheed Martin A2100A satellite for Japan Broadcasting Satellite
Systems Corp. (BSAT) and has a Ku-band television payload.


Erratum
-------

In the last issue, the launch time for Phoenix was wrong in the text,
but correct in the table: it should read 0926 UTC not 1026 UTC.

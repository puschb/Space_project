Jonathan's Space Report
No. 585                                            2007 Sep 19, Somerville
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shuttle and Station
-------------------

Endeavour landed on runway 15 at Kennedy Space Center at 1632 UTC on Aug
21. The deorbit burn at 1525 UTC lowered the orbit from 336 x 347 km to
about -28 x 342 km; landing mass was 100878 kg.

On Aug 30 the PMA-3 docking port was moved from Unity's port side to its
nadir side, freeing the port side for use by the Harmony module to be
launched on STS-120. The Canadarm-2 was used to unberth PMA-3 about 1215
UTC and reattach it at 1309 UTC.

Proton failure
--------------

A Krunichev Proton-M rocket failed just after second stage ignition on
Sep 6, destroying the Japanese JCSAT-11 communications satellite
payload. Proton-M serial 53522 took off from complex 39 at area 200 with
JCSAT-11 and the Briz-M No. 88522 upper stage. The first stage separated
2 min after launch.  It seems there was some kind of problem with second
 stage ignition, and the vehicle fell back to Earth from an altitude of
around 75 km.


JCSAT-11 was a Lockheed Martin A2100 series satellite with a launch mass
of 4007 kg.

Kosmos-2427
-----------

Russia's Kosmos-2427 Kobal't-M class imaging satellite, launched on June 7,
landed around 2100 UTC on Aug 22 after 76 days. Two objects, 2007-22D and E,
separated in orbit prior to the recovery from a 178 x 350 km x 67.1 deg orbit.

Insat 4CR
---------

The Insat 4CR Ku-band television satellite was launched on Sep 2 by
India's GSLV rocket. GSLV-F04 took off from the second launch pad at
Satish Dhawan Space Centre and put the Insat in a 196 x 31878 km x 15.8
deg transfer orbit.  The apogee is a little lower than the standard
35800 km GTO apogee, but the Insat on-board apogee engine was able to
make up the difference and in Sep 3 it was in a 2981 x 35712 km x 11.0
deg intermediate orbit. By Sep 6 Insat 4CR was in a 32579 x 35226 km x
0.3 deg orbit approaching geostationary altitude. The satellite replaces
Insat 4C, lost in the destruction of GSLV-F02 in 2006. (GSLV-F03 has not
yet been launched.)

Kosmos-2429
-----------

A Russian Defense Ministry Parus-class navigation satellite
was launched on Sep 11 into a 943 x 1008 km x 83.0 deg orbit using
a Kosmos-3M rocket and given the code name Kosmos-2429.

Kaguya
------

The Japanese SELENE moon probe, Kaguya, was launched from Tanegashima
spaceport on Sep 14. Planned orbit was 281 x 232805 km x 29.9 deg;
later maneuvers by the probe will raise the apogee to lunar distance.

Foton M-3
---------

The Foton M-3 satellite was launched from Baykonur on Sep 14 carrying
Russian and European microgravy, life sciences and technology
experiments. The spacecraft is in a 258 x 280 km x 62.9 deg orbit. Prior
to reentry it will release the European YES-2/Fotino space
tether/reentry experiment.

WorldView-1
-----------

DigitalGlobe's WorldView-1 satellite was launched on Sep 18 by a
Boeing Delta 2 into a 493 x 494 km x 97.5 deg orbit. WorldView-1
carries a 0.6-m aperture imaging telescope/camera for high resolution
Earth imaging; DigitalGlobe's main customer will be the US
National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA).

CBERS-2B
--------

CBERS-2B, the third China-Brazil environmental research satellite, was
launched from China's Taiyuan space center on Sep 19 into a 736 x 741 km
polar orbit. The satellite will probably raise its orbit to 774 x 774 km
over the next few days, matching the other CBERS satellites.


NFIRE Mission 2a
----------------

As I reported in earlier issues, the NFIRE (Near Field IR Experiment)
satellite was launched on Apr 24 by a Minotaur I from Launch Area 0B at
Wallops Island. The Missile Defense Agency satellite was built by
General Dynamics' Gilbert, Arizona (former Spectrum Astro) unit based on
its SA-200 bus and is managed by the USAF Missile Defense Space Systems
Office (SMC/SS) at Los Angeles Air Force Base, which is also responsible
for the STSS space tracking satellite program. NFIRE was launched into a
255 x 465 km x 48.2 deg orbit; from May 3 to May 18 the orbit was raised
to 489 x 497 km and it remained in that orbit on Aug 2. On Aug 9,
the orbit was lowered again to 243 x 487 km and by Aug 23 it was
in a 219 x 450 km orbit.

NFIRE carries a German laser communications terminal, Tesat, as a
secondary payload, but its main instrument is TSP, the Track Sensor
Payload, which includes visible and short, medium and long wave infrared
sensors to track missiles and their rocket plumes, and is designed to
distinguish between the missile and its plume. The satellite is 494 kg
full 380 kg dry, 2.7m long and 1.3m diameter.

In a major test of the satellite, a Minotaur II rocket, TLV-7, was
launched at 0830 UTC on Aug 23 from Vandenberg's LF06 silo as NFIRE
Mission 2a. The Minotaur II is a three-stage Minuteman 2 missile
refurbished by Orbital Sciences with a new guidance and payload section,
and has been used for a number of suborbital missile defense tests. (The
Minotaur 1 is an orbital launch vehicle which uses the first two stages
of a Minuteman 2, topped with two stages taken from the Pegasus space
launch vehicle). On each of the two planned Mission 2 flights, the
rocket will be aimed to pass within 4 and 20 km of the NFIRE satellite
while its third stage motor is burning, allowing NFIRE to get a close
look at the rocket and its exhaust. The Missile Defense Agency reported
that the Mission 2a flyby was successful.

Suborbital flights
------------------

While on the subject of suborbital launches, here is a list of all
suborbital flights so far this year that I know about. Only those with
apogees above 80 km are included. I know the list is incomplete (and I
would welcome additions) but I thought it might be  interesting to my readers
to see the range of suborbital missions that are happening these days.
(Warning: wide format window needed to view this). Congrats to Stephan
McCandliss for his successful ultraviolet telescope flight on Aug 13 which
observed the Trifid Nebula (M20).

Shuttle and Station
-------------------

The Expedition 15 crew of Fyodor Yurchikin and Oleg Kotov, and visiting
Malaysian astronaut  Sheikh Muszaphar Shukor, undocked from the
Station's Zvezda port in Soyuz TMA-10 at 0714 UTC on Oct 21. Soyuz
TMA-10 fired its deorbit engines at 0947 and, after a ballistic reentry,
landed in Kazakhstan at 1036 UTC. The Expedition 16 crew of Peggy
Whitson (Commander), Yuriy Malenchenko (Flight Engineer 1) and Clay
Anderson (Flight Engineer 2) remained aboard the Station. Spaceship
Soyuz TMA-11, docked at the Zarya port, serves as the emergency ferry
ship for the Expedtion 16 crew. The Progress M-61 cargo ship is docked
at the Pirs port.

Orbiter OV-103 Discovery took off from pad 39A at Kennedy Space Center 
on Shuttle mission STS-120, Station flight 10A, at 1538 UTC on Oct 23.
Discovery, commanded by astronaut Pam Melroy, docked with the PMA-2 port
on the Destiny module at 1240 UTC on Oct 25.  Here is my estimated
cargo manifest for the mission:

At 1001 UTC on Oct 26 the Quest airlock was depressurized and the hatch opened,
and astronauts Parazynski and Wheelock began the first STS-120 spacewalk
in EMU suits 3004 and 3003 respectively. They removed an antenna from
the Z1 truss and stowed it in the payload bay, prepared the P6 truss
for separation from Z1, and supervised the installation of the Node-2
Harmony module. Harmony was unberthed from Discovery's payload bay at 1340 UTC
by the Station Canadarm-2, and installed on Node-1 Unity at 1538 UTC.
The astronauts reentered Quest, closing the hatch at 1558 UTC and repressurizing
the airlock at 1616 UTC.

On Oct 28 astronauts Parazynski and Tani, in suits 3004 and 3018, 
depressurized Quest at 0927 UTC, opening the hatch at 0932 UTC. At 1103
UTC the P6 truss was unberthed from Z1 and moved to a park position. The
spacewalkers installed handrails and a grapple fixture on Harmony and
inspected the malfunctioning Solar Array Rotary Joint (SARJ) on the
S3/S4 truss. They closed the hatch at 1600 UTC and repressurized the
airlock at 1605 UTC.

On Oct 29 two more radiators were deployed from the S1 truss at 0530 and
0550 UTC. The Shuttle RMS grappled P6 at 0704 UTC and the Station arm
released it at 0832 UTC; then the Station arm on its MBS truck moved along
the truss, and regrappled P6 at 1314 UTC, with the Shuttle RMS releasing
it again at 1321 UTC; the following morning, the Station arm moved P6 to
near the end of P5.

On Oct 30 at 0841 UTC the Quest was again depressurized for the third
spacewalk, this time by Parazynski and Wheelock. The hatch was open at 0844 UTC
and the astronauts supervised the mating of P6 to P5 which was completed at
1110 UTC. A radiator was deployed on P6 at 1253 UTC; Wheelock transferred
a spare Main Bus Switching Unit (MBSU) from the Shuttle bay to the External
Stowage Platform 3 (ESP3) on the Station at 1430 UTC. From 1441 to 1532 UTC
the P6 solar array wing 2B was redeployed; array 4B on the other
side of P6 was deployed starting at 1609 UTC but at 1624 UTC a tear
developed in the solar array and the process was halted. The astronauts
had reentered the airlock, closing the hatch at 1545 UTC and repressurizing
at 1553 UTC.

GPS 55
------

GPS satellite SVN 55, the Block IIR(M)-17 launch, was orbited on Oct 17.
This is the 4th IIR(M) launch. ULA (United Launch Alliance)
launched the Boeing Delta 7925 into a 197 x 20368 km x 40.0 deg transfer
orbit. The solid apogee motor was fired on Oct 19 to put the GPS satellite
in a 20149 x 20213 km x 54.9 deg orbit.

Kosmos-2430
------------

An Oko early warning satellite was launched on Oct 23 from Plesetsk into
a 521 x 39057 km x 62.8 deg orbit and named Kosmos-2430. The Oko satellites
are built by NPO Lavochkin.

Chang'e-1
---------

China's first deep space probe was launched on Oct 24. Chang'e-1 
is designed to enter lunar orbit; its initial orbit was
221 x 50602 km x 31.0 deg, and by Oct 26 this had been raised to 594 x 71317 km.


Kosmos-2431/32/33
-----------------

Three Uragan-M navigation satellites, Nos. 718, 719 and 720, were
launched to replenish the Glonass navigation system. A Krunichev
Proton-K rocket with an Energiya DM-11S861 upper stage put the three
satellites in 19120 x 19130 km 64 deg orbits. The satellites
were given Kosmos cover names after deployment.

Globalstar
----------

Four more Globalstar satellites were launched by Soyuz-FG/Fregat on Oct
20. Globalstar FM 66, 67, 68 and 70 are the last of the first generation
constellation. The satellites were inserted into 913 x 930 km x 52.0 deg
orbits. The Soyuz third stage entered a 187 x 218 km orbit; the Fregat
fourth stage made a first burn to around 200 x 930 km, a second burn to
circularize the orbit and deploy the satellites, and a third burn to
deorbit itself over the Pacific.


Ariane
-------

On Oct 5 at 2328 UTC, the EPS third stage of Ariane 5GS vehicle L526
reignited in the first in-orbit restart test of an Aestus engine. The
test, which followed successful deployment of the Intelsat IS-11 and
Optus D-2 satellites, sets ESA up for the launch of the Jules Verne ATV
cargo ship in 2008. The burn lowered the orbit slightly from 590 x 35790
km to 358 x 33480 km.

Erratum - Dawn
--------------

I said that Dawn's asteroid orbit insertion would be done by the hydrazine
engines rather than the ion engines, but this is wrong. Marc Rayman writes:

 Asteroid orbit insertion as well as transfers between science orbits and
 Vesta escape all will be accomplished with the ion propulsion system. 
 The hydrazine is principally for reaction wheel desaturation and safe
 mode entry (including rate control after launch vehicle separation).  To
 extend reaction wheel life, we may also fly part of the mission using
 hydrazine for attitude control.  We do have a budget of 10 m/s for a
 contingency orbit change maneuver with hydrazine, but the range of cases
 in which that would be needed is small.

STS-38/Atlantis is due for launch on Nov 15.  Stacking of the solid
rocket boosters for mission STS-39/Discovery has begun on Mobile
Launcher 2 in the Vehicle Assembly Building. Columbia remains
on pad LC39B ready for a December launch.

Gennadiy Manakov and Gennadiy Strekalov continue in orbit aboard the
Mir/Kvant/Kvant-2/Kristall/Soyuz TM-10/Progress M-5 complex. 
The spacewalk on Oct 30 lasted 3h 45m; the cosmonauts failed
to repair the Kvant-2 EVA hatch.

The 21st Gorizont communications satellite was launched from
Baykonur on Nov 3 by 4-stage Proton.

The third Titan IV was launched on Nov 13 at 0037 UT.  It reportedly
carried the DSP F15 early warning satellite to geostationary orbit,
using an IUS upper stage.  The satellite carries an infrared Schmidt
telescope which monitors rocket launches; it is operated by US Space
Command.  The next satellite in the series, F16, is scheduled for launch
by Shuttle on mission STS 44.

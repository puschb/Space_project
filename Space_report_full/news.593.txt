Shuttle and Station
-------------------

On Mar 11 Orbiter OV-105 Endeavour launched on Shuttle mission STS-123,
Station flight 1J/A. I observed STS-123's naked-eye ascent from the roof
of the Harvard Observatory in Cambridge, MA as a bright rapidly moving
object, vanishing at MECO, then, just as on previous occasions that I've
seen it from here, reappearing with only slightly lower brightness with
a roughly regular period for about 1 second every 6 or 7 seconds until
it set - presumably I'm seeing RCS burns, but I'm a bit surprised that
they are so bright.

Launch of STS-123 was at 0628:14 UTC. MECO put Endeavour in a 58 x 220 km  orbit;
OMS-2 came 38m 30s after launch and raised the orbit to roughly 220 x
233 km. On Mar 13 at 0220 UTC Endeavour reached a point 0.2 km below
the Station and began its final approach; it docked with PMA-2 at 0349 UTC.

Astronaut Garrett Reisman has joined the Expedition 16 crew of Whitson
and Malenchenko, replacing Leo Eyharts.

Added to the Station on this mission will be the Canadian Dextre
robot manipulator (to go on the end of the Canadarm-2) and the Japanese
Kibo ELM-PS, to be temporarily stowed on the zenith port of Harmony.
Japan's Kibo station module complex will eventually consist of the Kibo
JEM-PM (Pressurized Module; the main lab), the Kibo JEM-EF (Exposed Facility, for
external experiments), the ELM-PS (Experiment Logistics Module - Pressurized
Section), which plays a role similar to the MPLM logistics modules, 
the ELM-ES (Experiment Logistics Module - Exposed Section) for supply
of temporary experiments, a bit like the deployable ICC or SLP pallets,
and the JEM-RMS Japanese robot arm. The ELM-PS was built by  MHI
(Mitsubishi Heavy Industry) at its Tobishima factory in Nagoya; it will be
controlled from the Tsukuba facility of the Japanese space agency JAXA.

The Station arm grappled the Dextre pallet at around
0700 on Mar 13 and attached it to the Mobile Base System on the Station
truss by around 0800. At 0113 UTC on Mar 14 the Quest airlock was depressurized,
and Rick Linnehan (in EMU 3004) and Garrett Reisman (in EMU 3006) began
a spacewalk to prepare the ELM-PS for installation and begin assembling
Dextre from its component pieces. The airlock was repressurized to end
the spacewalk at 0819 UTC.

STS-123 also carries a lot of small payloads. The MISSE 6 payload
consists of two suitcase-like materials exposure trays, PEC 6a and PEC
6b, which will be attached to a lightweight adapter plane (LWAPA) to be
fixed to the Columbus External Payload Facility. The PEC cases are on
APC class sidewall carriers in the cargo bay, while the heavier LWAPA
needs the heftier SPA beam (GAS beam) carrier. Three more SPA beams
carry a spare Canadarm-2 Yaw Joint and a  pair of DCSU (Direct Current
Switching Unit) boxes, to be stowed on the Station ESP platform as
spares. Another SPA beam carries RIGEX, a US Air Force Space Test
Program payload which will evaluate inflatable materials inside a closed
canister. More APC carriers host EVA cargo stowage (ECSH), SIP
(standard interface panels, for what I'm not sure) and SPDU (the Station
Power Distribution Unit to let the Shuttle run off Station electricity
while docked).

Here is my version of the STS-123 payload bay manifest:

The Dextre robot is carried up on a Spacelab Pallet (SLP),
a flexible unpressurized cargo bay carrier built by British Aerospace (in their
Stevenage plant, I think?) in the late 1970s. At least 11 different
pallets seem to have flown, some at least 3 times, for a total of 32 missions
to date including the current one.
Here is a list of pallet flights; I don't have serial numbers for the more
recent flights, and would be glad to receive them. (The ISS Cupola used
to be planned for a pallet launch on STS-132, but I understand it is now
to be launched directly attached to Node 3. Pallet MD003 is probably the
same as F003, but I think E002 and E003 were separate builds of engineering
models for the pallet system and are not the same as F002 and F003.)

Meanwhile, the Jules Verne ATV has resumed its rendezvous sequence, now
that a propulsion anomaly has been resolved; by late on Mar 11 it was in
a 275 x 291 km orbit. Dan Deak confirms from CSG sources that the EPS
stage did indeed reenter following its deorbit burn at 0628 UTC on Mar
9. Two more burns were made on Mar 12 and raised the orbit to 302 x 316 km; 
a test of the collision avoidance manuever is planned on Mar 14.

AMC 14
------

An International Launch Services/Khrunichev Proton-M was launched from
Baykonur on Mar 14. The Proton third stage was suborbital; the Briz-M
upper stage entered a 173 km parking orbit at 2337 UTC, but the second
burn at 0017 UTC on Mar 15, meant to send it to an 890 x 35745 km x 49.1
deg transfer orbit, failed in some way, stranding the Lockheed Martin
A2100AXS communications satellite payload, AMC 14 out of reach of
geostationary orbit.  The burn was planned as an extremely long duration
one: 34 minutes. No further details are available at the moment.

AMC 14 was to be owned by SES Americom and leased
by Echostar, replacing Echostar 3 at 61.5W.  The satellite has a launch
mass of 4140 kg, probably including around 2000 kg of MON-3 nitrogen
tetroxide  and MMH (monomethyl hydrazine) propellant.


Recent Proton failures include Arabsat 4A in 2006 Nov, a similar failure
in which the long 30-minute second burn of the Briz ended prematurely;
Arabsat was deliberately deorbited a month later to avoid an
uncontrolled reentry. Another failure in 2007, JCSAT 11, was unrelated
(stage 1/2 separation failure).

Prognoz 6
---------

The SO-M No. 506 solar particles observatory was launched in September
1977 and given the code name Prognoz 6. It and the Blok SO-L fourth
stage of the 8K78M Molniya launch vehicle entered a 488 x 200000 km x
65.0 deg elliptical orbit. On 2008 Mar 6 Prognoz-6 was in a 26274 x
171974 km x 51.7 orbit; the Blok SO-L was never tracked, but has now
finally been cataloged in a 33653 x 161978 x 48.1 deg orbit. I hope this
indicates a new interest at Space Command in documenting the deep space
population of objects, which is very poorly cataloged at present.

NROL-28
-------

United Launch Alliance launched a Lockheed Martin Atlas V 411 from Space
Launch Complex 3-East at Vandenberg on Mar 13. The mission, which used
vehicle AV-006, was a National Reconnaissance Office launch designated
NROL-28 and placed a payload designated USA 200 in an elliptical 12-hour
63-degree inclination orbit. Observers in Beijing saw the venting of the
Centaur after separation as a bright naked-eye transient 'comet'.

Analysts believe that this launch is the second in a new series of
satellites carrying combined signals intelligence and early warning payloads,
and is similar to USA 184 launched on NROL-22 (a Delta 4) in 2006 Jun.
USA 184 probably carried the SBIRS HEO-1 infrared missile early warning package
and the NASA/Los Alamos TWINS-A magnetospheric research payload; I expect
that HEO-2 and TWINS-B are aboard the new launch. This is believed to be
the 12th highly elliptical orbit NRO signals intelligence mission since the
launch of the first JUMPSEAT mission in 1971, although there is some
uncertainty about the identity of flights 6 and 7:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shuttle and Station
-------------------

Aboard the International Space Station, astronauts Sergey Volkov,
Oleg Kononenko and Garrett Reisman continue the EO-17 expedition.
The Soyuz TMA-12 ferry craft is docked to the Pirs module, and
the Jules Verne cargo ship is at the Zvezda port.

Progress M-64 was launched on May 14 and docked with Zarya on May 16.

GIOVE B
--------

The second European Galileo navigation system test satellite left the
launch pad on Apr 26 at 2216 UTC on a Soyuz-FG/Fregat.

The spacecraft was built for ESA and European Satellite Navigation Industries
by Astrium using a Thales Proteus spacecraft bus; the satellite
was integrated by Thales in its Rome factory (which I believe is
the former Selenia Spazio plant?). GIOVE B has a mass of 530 kg.

The Soyuz-FG placed Giove/Fregat in a suborbital path; the first
Fregat burn placed the stack in a 170 km parking orbit.
At 0201 UTC on Apr 27 Giove B reached a 23118 x 23246 km orbit inclined 56 deg.

PSLV
----

The Indian Space Research Organization's Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle
flight C9 placed the Cartosat-2A imaging satlelite in a 620 x 661 km x
97.9 deg polar orbit on Apr 28, together with a cluster of small
satellites. The Indian Mini Satellite 1 is a small imaging satellite
with a mass of around 60 kg. The other payloads were nanosatellites with
masses from 1 to 7 kg: Cute-1.7/APD-II for the Tokyo Institute of
Technology; AAUSat-II for the University of Aalborg (Denmark); Can X-2
for UTIAS (the University of Toronto Institiute of Aerospace Studies);
Compass-1 for the Fachhochschule Aachen (Germany); Delfi-C3 for the
Technical University of Delft (Netherlands); SEEDS 2 for Nihon
University (Tokyo); and Can X-6, a collaboration between UTIAS and Com
Dev International. Can X-6 carries a payload for relaying identification
beacon data from shipping. Rubin-8-AIS remains attached to the PSLV
final stage and is also for locating ships.

AAUSat-II carries a gamma ray burst detector for the Danish National Space
Center.



Amos 3
-------

The Israeli Amos 3 communications satellite was launched on Apr 28 by
Zenit-3SLB from Baykonur. The Blok DM-SLB made three burns to a low
parking orbit, a 180 x 39064 km x 48.8 deg transfer orbit, and a 34225 x
39368 km x 0.7 deg near-geosynchronous orbit where it deployed Amos 3.
This deployment orbit is claimed by the Amos operators to be slightly
different from the target one, although Land Launch, which operates the
Zenit-3SLB, denies the launch vehicle was at fault. I am counting the
launch as a success. By May 12 Amos 3 was in a 35762 x 35928 km x 0.1
deg orbit drifting at 0.8 deg W per day.


AMC 14
------

The AMC 14 satellite has been moved to a 16846 x 35605 km x 19.5 deg
transfer orbit and is now expected to be moved to an inclined
geosynchronous orbit.

Galaxy 18
---------

A Sea Launch Zenit-3SL was launched from the Odyssey platform in 
the Pacific and put Intelsat's Galaxy 18 satellite in transfer orbit.
By May 22 it was in a 9423 x 35609 km x 0.1 deg orbit.

C/NOFS
------

Antonio Elias of Orbital very kindly provided me with some details
of the C/NOFS launch, via the nasaspaceflight.com forum.

The L-1011 aircraft took off from Kwaj at 1604:00 UTC on Apr 16,
and dropped the Pegasus at 1702:48. Ignition of stage 1 followed,
as normal, 5 seconds later. The drop point was 10.5229N 167.7562E
(geodetic), which is a little to the north of the HETE-2 drop point.

C/NOFS is currently in a 405 x 851 km x 13.0 deg orbit.


PHOENIX
--------

The Mars Phoenix probe landed on Mars at 2338:24 UTC on May 25.
Landing site was near 68.22N 234.3E (areocentric), the Green Valley site
among the Scandia Colles in Vastitas Borealis.

Yubilyeniy
----------

Russia launched three Gonets-class low orbit communications satellites
on May 23. Unusually, they were given Kosmos designations - they
may actually be the Strela-3 military version of Gonets.
The launch also carried Yubilyeniy (Jubilee), a test satellite with
an amateur radio payload to commemorate the 50th anniversary of Sputnik
last year.

The Gonets satellites are in a 1476 x 1510 km x 82.5 deg orbit;
the depleted Briz stage is in a 1200 x 1506 km orbit.

FY-3A
-----

China launched the FY-3A polar orbiting weather satellite on May 27.
The FY-3 series replaces the older FY-1 polar system (FY-2 satellites
make up the geostationary system and will be replaced by the FY-4 series).
FY-3A entered an 806 x 810 km x 98.8 deg orbit; the final stage
is in a 703 x 801 km orbit.

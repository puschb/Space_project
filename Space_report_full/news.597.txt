Shuttle and Station
-------------------

The Japanese Kibo pressurized module is now attached to the Station.
Discovery took off at 2101 UTC on May 31 on Shuttle mission STS-124,
Station mission 1J, using external tank ET-128. A 76 m/s OMS-2 burn at
2140 UTC put the Shuttle in its targeted orbit. STS-124  delivered the
Kibo Pressurized Module, the largest component of the Japanese station
element, to ISS. Discovery docked at PMA-2 at 1803 UTC on Jun 2.
Astronauts Fossum and Garan made three spacewalks from Quest using EMU
3015 and 3017; they supported the installation of Kibo PM, inspected the
Solar Alpha Rotary Joints, and changed out a nitrogen tank. The Kibo
module was installed on Harmony by 2301 UTC on Jun 4; the Japanese
Logistics Module was transferred from Harmony to Kibo on Jun 6 between
1917 and 2004 UTC. The Shuttle undocked on Jun 11 at 1142 UTC and landed
at 1515 UTC on Jun 14 on runway 15 at Kennedy Space Center.

 The STS-124 payload bay contained:

GLAST
-----

NASA's new Gamma Ray Large Area Space Telescope, GLAST, was launched on
Jun 11 into a 542 x 561 km x 25.6 deg orbit.  GLAST's main instrument is
the LAT (Large Area Telescope) which is a CsI calorimeter array with a
plastic scintillator detector, viewing 20 percent of the sky at a time
with a spatial resolution of a few arcminutes, unprecedented in a high
energy gamma ray satellite. LAT observes in the 20 MeV-300 GeV energy
range, and  is a successor to COS-B and CGRO-EGRET. A secondary
experiment, the Gamma Burst Monitor, operates in the lower 10 keV-30 MeV
 range and is a successor to CGRO-BATSE. The 25.6 deg inclination is
unusual, requiring extra fuel during launch from the 28.5 deg North
launch site at Cape Canaveral; reducing the amount of time spent in the
South Atlantic Anomaly improves the sensitivity of the observations.


Zhongxing 9
-----------

China launched a communications satellite on Jun 10. ZX-9, or Chinasat 9,
is a Thales Alenia Space satellite (Spacebus 4000C1 model).
Launch was to a 245 x 49592 km supersynchronous transfer orbit.

Turksat 3A/Skynet 5C
--------------------

Arianespace launched Ariane 5ECA vehicle L540 on flight V183
on Jun 12. The EPC stage reached a -1062 x 172 km x 6.8 deg
sub-orbit, and the ESC-A stage delivered two satellites
to transfer orbit. Turksat 3A is a Thales Alenia Space
Spacebus 4000B2 satellites for the privatized Turksat AS
communications company; Skynet 5C is an Astrium Eurostar E3000
satellite for Paradigm, the private company which operates
the Skynet system for the UK Ministry of Defence. As of Jun 24,
Skynet was over 17.8W and Turksat was at 31E.

AMC 14
------

The AMC 14 satellite launched on Mar 15 is slowly increasing its orbital
height, presumably using the arcjet thrusters. On Jun 25 it was in a
17837 x 35664 km x 19.1 deg orbit.

Amos 3
------

Amos 3 remains on station at 2.4 deg W. The Land Launch upper stage, a
Blok DM-SLB, has now also been cataloged. It entered a roughly 34220 x
39400 km x 0.7 deg orbit on Apr 29; the apogee was 1000 km higher than
intended due to a programming error. The Briz stage from the Feb 11 Thor
2R (2008-006) launch has not been cataloged yet; it is probably in
a 33800 x 35600 km x 0.2 deg orbit following a depletion burn from its
last known orbit at 36746 x 36840 km x 0.0 deg.

IUE
---

A debris object has been cataloged in the orbit of IUE (the International
Ultraviolet Explorer, an early space telescope). It may be
the telescope dust cover, ejected shortly after launch in 1978.

Orbcomm
-------

Six new Orbcomm satellites were launched on Jun 19. The CDS-3
satellite carries an AIS Automated Identification System used
for tracking ships at sea, similar to the one on the NTS/CanX-6
nanosatellite launched earlier this year. The five remaining satellites
carry standard Orbcomm payloads; all six use a bus from Polyot (Omsk)
integrated by OHB (Bremen), instead of the older Orbital Microstar bus
used by previous Orbcomms.

I don't have the official Orbcomm names of the new satellites; the
temporary R-1 to R-5 designations are my own.


Jason 2
-------

The Jason-2 Ocean Surface Topography Mission was launched on Jun 20. The
main instrument on the joint French-US mission is the Poseidon 3
altimeter to measure sea surface heights. The Delta first stage
reportedly underperformed slightly, but the second stage made up the
deficit and reached a 185 x 1414 km x 66.5 deg transfer orbit, a 1329 x
1335 km x 66.0 deg mission orbit where it deployed Jason-2, and two
further burns to a 1332 x 4258 x 65.85 orbit and then a 2160 x 4360 km x
65.2 deg disposal orbit, using extra fuel left over because the payload
was so light. The final orbit was expected to be 2468 x 4824 km, but the
additional propellant usage in the first burn seems to have reduced the
height achieved.  Jason-2 is a Thales Proteus class satellite with a
launch mass of 506 kg.

Kosmos-2440
------------

Kosmos-2440 is a new geostationary early warning satellite for the
Russian Defense Ministry, operated by the PVO (Air Defense Force).
It is a US-KMO (Prognoz) class satellite, built by the Lavochkin
company, and features a large infrared telescope. Launch was by
a Proton-K with a Blok DM-3 upper stage.

Shuttle and Station
--------------------

Sergey Volkov, Oleg Kononenko, and Greg Chamitoff remain aboard the
Station as Expedition 17. The Jules Verne ATV was deorbited over
the Pacific on Sep 29, reentering at 1331 UTC. Progress M-65 and
Soyuz TMA-12 are docked to the Station.

Soyuz TMA-13 was launched at 0701 UTC on Oct 12 and reached orbit at
0710 UTC. Commander is Yuriy Lonchakov, flight engineer is Michael
Fincke, and in the third seat is spaceflight participant (tourist)
Richard Garriott. Garriott is the son of of Skylab astronaut Owen
Garriott. Once they reach the Station, Garriott consitutes ISS visiting
crew EP-15; Fincke is commander of Expedition 18, with Lonchakov as
flight engineer. The TMA-13 callsign is 'Titan'.


Shenzhou 7
----------

The Shenzhou 7 spaceship was launched on Sep 25. The crew were Zhai
Zhigang, commander ("zhilingzhang"), Liu Boming, orbital module
astronaut ("guidaocang hangtianyuan") and Jing Haipeng, descent module
monitor astronaut ("fanhuicang zhishou hangtianyuan" ).  On the previous
flight, Nie Haisheng's role was 'operator' - 'caozuoshou', with Fei
Junlong as zhihuizhang ('commander'). (Thanks to contributor 'hesidu' on
nasaspaceflight.com for these Chinese designations.)

On Sep 27, China accomplished its first spacewalk. The SZ-7 orbital
module (guidaocang, GC) was depressurized by about 0830 UTC. The hatch
was opened at 0838 UTC with a residual pressure of 20 mbar. Zhai
Zhigang, wearing a Chinese-made Feitian spacesuit, emerged at 0843 UTC
and was fully outside by 0844 UTC. Meanwhile, Liu Boming, wearing a
Russian suit, Orlan-M No. 42, remained partially inside the GC. He made a SEVA
(Stand-Up EVA, i.e. partially emerging - a term from Gemini days) at
0848 for about 2 minutes and handed Zhai a Chinese flag to wave. Zhai
translated along the GC retrieved a materials sample tray mounted on the
module exterior, and returned to the hatch area at  0854 UTC. He went
inside at 0858 UTC.  The hatch was closed at 0859-0900 UTC and the GC
was repressurized sometime around 0915 UTC, and the pressure was back up
to 400 mbar by  0926 UTC. (Some of these time estimates are courtesy of
Andrey Krasil'nikov's postings on nasaspaceflight.com). The descent
module (fanhuicang, FC) stayed pressurized throughout, and the third
crewmember, Jing Haipen, stayed there with no spacesuit on.

I estimate that time in depressurized operations was around 45 min for 
Zhai and Liu; hatch open/close time was 22 min; time outside was 14 min
for Zhai only. I find the depressurization time to be more interesting,
so that's what I mainly track in my records.

A 40 kg subsatellite was ejected from the nose of the SZ7 orbital module at
1127 UTC. It is probably object the designated 2008-47G by the US (47C-F seem
to be the separation motor covers from the second stage, based on their
orbital parameters). On Sep 28 it was in a 329 x 338 km orbit.
The subsatellite was informally referred to as BanXing (companion satellite)
by Chinese commentators, but does not seem to have an official name.

On Sep 28, the GC orbital module was ejected at 0848 UTC, and at about
0851:16 UTC the propulsion module (tuijincang, TC) ignited for the
deorbit burn over the South Atlantic at 7.5N 24.1W, at 330 km altitude.
The burn was completed at about 0853:18 UTC (based on the graphics on
Chinese TV coverage) over 13.6N 19.3W. I estimate that the delta-V was
about 115 m/s, similar to Soyuz, and that the post-burn orbit was -50 x 330
km x 42.4 deg. At 0913 UTC the FC and the TC separated as reentry began,
about 150 km over western Tibet. The TC probably burnt up at around 0918
UTC over the Gobi desert, and the FC deployed its main parachute at 0924
UTC, with landing at 0937:40 UTC at 42.278N 111.355E in the Chinese
province of Nei Monggol (Inner Mongolia), between Hohhot and Erenhot.

The GC remains in a 329 x 336 km x 42.4 deg orbit, with designation 
2008-47H.


Falcon 1
--------

SpaceX's Falcon 1 rocket has reached orbit on its fourth try. The
successful launch from Omelek Island at Kwajalein Atoll in the Pacific
carried a dummy 'mass simulator' satellite, nicknamed Ratsat, which
remained attached to the Falcon 1 second stage. After a short restart
burn, the stage is in a 621 x 643 km x 9.35 deg orbit.


Hubble Space Telescope
----------------------

The primary science data formatter control unit  on HST has failed,
temporarily halting science operations. This has delayed the
STS-125 servicing mission.


AMC 14
------

The AMC 14 satellite continues to slowly raise its orbit towards
geostationary. It now has a period of over 20 hours, at 27379 x 36198 km x
15.8 deg. The satellite was stranded in transfer orbit in March.

THEOS
-----

Kosmotras launched a Dnepr vehicle from the Yasniy (Dombarovskiy)
missile base  on Oct 1, placing the THEOS satellite in sun-synchronous
orbit. THEOS is owned by the Geo-Informatics and Space Technology
Development Agency (GISTDA; Bangkok) of the Thai Ministry of Science and
Technology. THEOS was built by EADS Astrium (I think Astrium/Toulouse?)
using the same bus as Rocsat-2.

THEOS is in a 672 x 692 km x 98.4 deg orbit; the plume shield is 645 x
688 km x 98.8 deg, and the third stage is in a 675 x 1172 km x 98.8 deg
orbit.

FORMOSAT-3
----------

The Taiwan/US FORMOSAT-3 ionospheric research constellation was launched
in April 2006 into initial orbits of 497 x 537 km x 72.0 deg.
Based on a report at the 58th IAC in 2007, the individual
satellites can now be identified; objects 2006-11A,B,C,D,E and F
are satellites FORMOSAT-3 FM6, FM1, FM5, FM3, FM4 and FM2 respectively.
Five of the satellites have reached their operational 750 x 850 km orbits,
but FM3 is apparently stuck in an intermediate orbit due
to solar array problems.
Here are some details for those of you who love keeping their satellite
catalogs up to date. The Rel.Long column gives the orbit ascending node
relative to that of FM5; FM3 is drifting relative to the constellation
because of its lower altitude.

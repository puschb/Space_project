Shuttle and Station
--------------------

The Expedition 18 crew of Michael Fincke, Yuiry Lonchakov and Greg
Chamitoff continues work on board the ISS. Soyuz TMA-13 is docked to
the Zarya port.

Nov 15 saw the launch of Shuttle mission STS-126, ISS flight ULF-2
(Utilization and Logistics Flight 2) with Orbiter OV-105 Endeavour,
External Tank ET-129 and Solid Rocket Motors RSRM-104 (SRB set BI-136).
STS-126 was launched from Mobile Launch Platform 3 on Pad 39A.
Endeavour and ET-129 reached an orbit of 59 x 230 km x 51.6 deg,
8 min after launch. At 0134 UTC Endeavour executed the
OMS-2 burn into a 158 x 230 km orbit.

Crew of STS-126 are Christopher Ferguson, Eric Boe, Don Pettit, Stephen
Bowen, Heidemarie Stefanyshyn-Piper, Shane Kimbrough, and Expedition 18
flight engineer Sandra Magnus who will stay aboard ISS replacing 
Chamitoff.


Here is my version of the payload bay equipment manifest for STS-126:

  ----------------------------------------------------
                                     Cargo total 17370

Total mass of the orbiter at ET separation is 116500 kg.

This flight doesn't add anything significant to the outside of
the ISS, but stocks up the interior, making the ISS more liveable.
The Multi-Purpose Logistics Module (MPLM) Leonardo is carrying
6956 kg of cargo including two crew quarters racks,
and three racks to support the cycling of consumables through
the crew: the Galley rack, for consuming things which later
pass through the WHC (Waste and Hygiene Compartment) rack, and
then two Water Recovery System racks which recycle the waste into
drinkable water to begin again. There's also an experiment rack,
the CIR (Combustion integration rack), and miscellaneous supplies
in three RSRs (Resupply Stowage Racks) and six RSPs (Resupply Stowage
Platforms).


IBEX
----

IBEX has reportedly reached its final orbit of around 12000 x 320000 km,
but I haven't seen any detailed orbital data or information on the
orbit raising burns.


Simon Bolivar
-------------

Venezuela's first satellite, VENESAT-1 or 'Simon Bolivar', was launched
from Xichang in China on Oct 29 aboard a Chang Zheng 3B rocket. The
satellite is a DFH-4 class bus built by CAST/Beijing and carries C-band
and Ku-band transponders; it has a mass of around 5100 kg. Simon Bolivar
is operated by the  Agencia Bolivariana para Actividades Espaciales
(Bolivarian Agency for Space Activities) in Caracas, under the Ministry
of Popular Power for Science and Technology.

Launch was into a 169 x 41771 km x 24.80 deg orbit. By Nov 12 the
satellite was in a 35784 x 35788 km x 0.4 deg orbit over 78.0W;
details of orbit raising burns are not available.


Chandraayan-1
--------------

According to ISRO, on Oct 29 Chandraayan-1's orbit was raised to 465 x
267000 km, on its way to lunar orbit. My estimate from Space-Track data
is 575 x 261997 km x 18.1 deg. On Nov 3, the apogee was increased further to
380000 km.

Chandrayaan-1 entered lunar orbit on Nov 8. ISRO reported the initial
orbit as 504 x 7502 km x 90.0 deg. By Nov 12 the orbit had been lowered
to 100 x 100 km x 90.0 deg. On Nov 14 at 1436 UTC it ejected a 29 kg
Moon Impact Probe (MIP). The MIP fired a small deorbit motor to lower
its orbit to around -200 x 100 km, and hit the moon at 1501 UTC, near
Shackleton Crater at the south pole.


Chinese double launch
---------------------

A Chang Zheng 2D rocket launched two small satellites on Nov 5,
Chuanxin yihao 02 xing (Innovation Satellite no. 1 - 02) and Shiyan Weixing
sanhao (Experimental satellite no. 3).

SW-3 was built by the Harbin Inst. of Tech. and Beijing's DFH Satellite
Co. CX-1-02 was probably built by SIMIT (the Shanghai Inst. of
Microsystem and Information Technology) together with the Shanghai
Academy of Space Technology, the team that built the first CX-1
satellite launched in 2003.

The Xinhua news agency reports that CX-1-02 will collect and relay
hydrological and meteorological data and data for disaster relief. and
SW-3 will be used for experiments on new technologies in atmospheric
exploration. Mass of CX-1-02 is under 100 kg; SW-3 is larger but I don't
know how much larger. The satellites are in a 786 x 804 km x 98.5 deg
orbit; a third object in a 308 x 835 km orbit is probably the launch
vehicle second stage; it made a perigee-lowering depletion burn at about
0035 UTC, after satellite separation. This may explain why the Yaogan 2 
second stage, also a CZ-2D, was never cataloged: it probably made a
perigee-lowering burn which caused it to reenter on the first orbit.

Meanwhile, the two new Shi Jian 6 satellites have begun operation. The
name of the first satellite is Shijian liuhao 03 zu A xing, or 'Practice
Six Group 3 Satellite A', which I call SJ-6-03A for simplicity. (In the
Chinese news reports, the '6' is written as Chinese characters, but the
'03' and the 'A' as Arabic numerals and Roman letters. Go figure...)
SJ-6-03A has maneuvered from 579 x 603 km to 565 x 597 km to 585 x 601
km. SJ-6-03B remains in a 582 x 604 km orbit with no significant
manuevers. The SJ-6-03's final stage rocket is in a 504 x 703 km orbit
and an adapter is in an orbit just below the payloads at 580 x 604 km.

Astra 1M
---------

The Astra 1M communications satellite, for Luxembourg-based SES Astra,
was launched by Proton-M/Briz-M on Nov 5. The Proton reached -986 x 165
km x 51.5 deg; the Briz-M entered a 173 x 174 km parking orbit; after
its third burn, the  additional propellant tank was jettisoned in a 311
x 14176 km x 46.9 deg orbit at 0024 UTC on Nov 6. After a fifth burn,
the Briz separated from Astra 1M at 0556 UTC on Nov 6, in a 4983 x 35797
km x 21.5 deg orbit. By Nov 10 Astra 1M was in a 22543 x 35803 km x 3.8 deg
orbit approaching GEO.

Kosmos-2445
------------

On Nov 14 a Russian Defense Ministry Kobal't-M imaging reconnaissance
satellite codenamed Kosmos-2445 was launched into a 169 x 314 km x 67.1
deg orbit.

This is the fourth improved Kobal't satellite, all of which flew 
in similar 67.1 deg orbits:
  Kobal't-M   Kosmos-2410  2004 Sep 24-2005 Jan 9 (107 days)
  Kobal't-M   Kosmos-2420  2006 May  3-2006 Jul 19 (77 days)
  Kobal't-M   Kosmos-2427  2007 Jun  7-2007 Aug 22 (76 days)
  Kobal't-M   Kosmos-2445  2008 Nov 14

We can therefore expect this mission to last at least until Jan 29.
The satellite consists of a propulsion module, and a recoverable
camera module. It also carries two small supplementary SpK recoverable film
capsules which will be deorbited during the mission - alas, I haven't
managed to figure out a way to tell when the SpK recoveries happen.

Shuttle and Station
--------------------

The Expedition 18 crew of Michael Fincke, Yuriy Lonchakov and Sandra Magnus
continue work on board ISS.

Soyuz TMA-13 is docked to the Zarya port and Progress M-01M is
docked to the Pirs module.

On Dec 23, Lonchakov and Fincke performed a spacewalk (Russian
EVA-21) from the Pirs module using the Orlan M-26 and M-27 spacesuits.
Magnus remained inside the station.
The airlock was depressurized at 0011 UTC; following a problem with a
depressurization valve, extended pressure leak checks were carried out.
The hatch was opened at 0051 UTC. Fincke installed a Langmuir probe on
Pirs while Lonchakov retrieved the Biorisk canister 2. Then, the Impuls
and Expose-R experiments were installed on Zvezda. Expose-R failed to
activate and was removed and returned to the airlock. The hatch was
closed at 0629 UTC and the airlock repress began at 0639 UTC, reaching
the 35mm fiducial pressure I use at 0640 UTC, for a spacewalk
duration of 06h29m (depress/repress) or 5h38 (hatch open/close).


NROL-26
-------

Secret launch NRO L-26 for the National Reconnaissance Office took
off on a Delta 4 Heavy from complex 37B at Cape Canaveral on Jan 18.
The payload was designated USA 202. Analysts suggest it was probably
placed in geostationary orbit and is a new large-diameter-antenna
signals intelligence satellite in the series whose earlier codenames
were RHYOLITE, AQUACADE, MAGNUM, and ORION.

The Delta 4 final stage has been found by indepedent observers
in a 35943 x 38077 km x 3.0 deg near-synchronous orbit.

Yaogan Weixing 5
----------------

The Yaogan weixing wuhao (Resource satellite No. 5) was launched on Dec 15
from Taiyuan only two weeks after YW 4 was launched from Jiuquan.
This confirms the pattern of two different series within the Yaogan series,
but also complicates the picture since YW 5 is in a lower orbit than
previous satellites in the series - although similar to the ZY-2 satellites.

The launch vehicle was announced as a CZ-4B, although a CZ-4C had been
expected; the CZ-4C upper stage has a restartable YF-40A engine. 
Pictures of the latest launch show the larger nose fairing previously
used on the CZ-4C.

Note that the ZY-2-3 satellite was initially in a 480 x 500 km 
orbit like the other ZY-2 satellites. In 2008 June its apogee slowly increased,
and by September it was in a 520 x 533 km orbit. The orbit was then
changed to 530 x 590 km and by November to 550 x 610 km.

Fengyun 2-06
-------------

The Fengyun erhao 06 xing (Fengyun No. 2 satellite 06) weather satellite
was launched on Dec 23 by a CZ-3A (changzheng sanhao jia) three-stage
rocket from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center (xichang weixing fashe
zhongxin). I will refer to the satellite as FY 2-06. 

FY 2-06  reached geostationary orbit on Dec 23, firing its apogee motor
to enter a 35055 x 35447 x 2.7; after orbit circularization
it ejected its apogee motor into a 35117 x 35450 km x 2.7 deg orbit.
On Dec 26 china-spacenews.com reported that the satellite was on station
at 123.5E and called it Fengyun erhao E xing (FY-2E). I believe that
FY 2-06 is the prelaunch, factory production number name and FY-2E
is a post launch name, similar to the former NASA practice.


AMC 14
------

The Americom 14 satellite, which was stranded in transfer orbit after
launch on Mar 14, finally reached geosynchonous altitude in December
after months of low-thrust burns. By Nov 20 it was in a 1380 min, 32952
x 36408 km x 13.8 deg orbit and on Dec 19 its orbit was 1435.63 min,
35094 x 36459 x 13.1 deg drifting near 61 deg E.


Eutelsat 
--------

The European satellite telecoms company Eutelsat SA saw the launch of two
of its satellites on a single Ariane 5ECA rocket on Dec 20.

Hot Bird 9, an EADS Astrium Ku-band Eurostar 3000, has a dry mass of 2338 kg and
will replace Hot Bird 3 at 13E. Eutelsat W2M is also a Ku-band satellite and
will operate at 10E; built by EADS Astrium and ANTRIX/ISRO, it uses the ISRO I3K
(Insat) bus and represents the first foreign sale of an Indian-built satellite.

Glonass
-------

Three Uragan-M navigation satellites were launched on Dec 25 to supplement
the Glonass navigation system. The satellites, with the cover names
Kosmos-2447 to 2449, are serial numbers 727, 728 and 729. 

Ibuki
-----

Japan's H2A No. 15 rocket took off from Tanegashima on Jan 23 and placed
the GOSAT (Greenhouse Gas Observing Satellite) in a 669 x 672 km x 98.0
deg sun-synchronous orbit. GOSAT has been given the name 'Ibuki'
('breath'); it carries the TANSO-FTS IR spectrometer and the TANSO-CAI 
cloud and aerosol imager. GOSAT was developed by the Japanese space agency
JAXA and built by Mitsubishi Electric/Kamakura.

The 1750 kg Ibuki was accompanied by a cluster of small satellites released
from the H2A second stage. 

SDS-1 is JAXA's Small Demonstration Satellite, a 100 kg microsatellite
with a camera, GPS receiver and sun sensor.

SpriteSat is a 50 kg small satellite with a gravity gradient boom which
will study flashes from lightning 'sprites'. It was developed by Tohoku
University in Sendai.

SOHLA-1 was devloped by the Space Oriented Higashi-osaka Leading Association
(SOHLA), a group of aerospace companies in the Osaka region. It
carries a cloud cover imager and has a mass of 50 kg.

Kagayaki is a 28 kg technology satellite from the Sorun Corp. in Tokyo
with a variety of technology payloads.

Prism is a 5 kg remote sensing picosatellite from the University of Tokyo.
It has a 10-cm aperture Earth imager on a 1-meter deployable boom.

KKS-1 was built by Kouku-kosen (Tokyo Metropolitan College of Aeronautical Engineering)
and has a mass of 3 kg. It carries an Earth imager.

STARS, also named Kukai is a 7 kg Kagawa University picosatellite 
demonstrating a tethered space robot. It consists of two boxes, Ku and Kai,
connected by a tether.

Erratum
--------

In last issue's suborbital launch log, the NASA 36.221DS entry was spurious.
The launch has been delayed until 2009 Feb.

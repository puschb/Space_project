Shuttle and Station
--------------------

Gennadiy Padalka, Mike Barratt, and Koichi Wakata are aboard the Station
with Progress M-66 and Soyuz TMA-14 docked to it. Mike Fincke, Yuriy
Lonchakov, and Charles Simonyi undocked at 0355 UTC on Apr 8 aboard
Soyuz TMA-13, landing in Kazakhstan at 0716 UTC at 48 33 56N 69 23 51E,
151 km northeast of Dzezhkazgan.

Kepler
------

At 0218 UTC on Apr 8, Kepler ejected its 7.5 kg dust cover; the
telescope is now open to space. The dust cover will orbit the Sun in a
fractionally different path thanks to its 1.1 m/s ejection velocity, its
orbital period different by less than an hour. Kepler was 3.1 million km
from Earth at the time of ejection, in a 0.97 x 1.04 AU orbit inclined
0.46 deg to the ecliptic plane, at ecliptic latitude 0.3 deg and
ecliptic longitude 197.3 deg. Light travel time to Earth was 10 seconds.
(Thanks to JPL's Whitney Clavin for the dust cover mass and velocity).

Kwangmyongsong-2
-----------------

North Korea's Unha-2 rocket was launched from the Tonghae space center
at 0230 UTC on Apr 5. The second stage was tracked by Japan as it flew
over that country and fell in the Pacific. 

According to North Korean statements, a third rocket stage placed the
Kwangmyongsong-2 satellite in a 490 x 1426 km x 40.6 deg  orbit at 9min
2 sec after launch, but the US claims the launch failed and no other
nation has reported the detection of any orbiting objects from the
launch. I am recording the attempt as a failure. If the third stage did
not separate from the second, the orbit may have been around (very
roughly) -4550 x 490 km x 40.8 deg; An Apr 5 Yoimuri Shimbun report
forwarded to me by David Wright said the impact was 1270 km E of Japan,
but on Apr 6 the same paper was reporting a longer range and it seems
that the second stage impact was in fact in the region expected before
launch.

The North Korean news agency KCNA quoted 0220:00 UTC as the launch time.
Western press reported the launch time as  0230 UTC, and Russian sources
say they tracked the launch at 0232 UTC. The Worldview-1 satellite took
an image of the launch contrail from space reportedly at 0231:16 UTC, which
must have been within a couple minutes of launch, so I will adopt 0230
UTC as the best current estimate of the launch time.

Western analysts have assumed that the Unha-2 uses a larger-diameter
first stage than the Paektusan-1 rocket used in the 1998 launch attempt;
this has now been confirmed by images of the rocket released by North
Korea. The pictures are consistent with a rocket about 27m high and
2.2m in diameter, including a 14m long first stage, an 8m long second
stage with a diameter of 1.2-1.4m, and a third stage fairing with
a diameter around 1.0m (but possibly enclosing a smaller actual third
stage).

Eutelsat W2A
------------

International Launch Services delivered the Eutelsat W2A satellite to
orbit on a Khrunichev Proton-M/Briz-M on Apr 3. The Thales-Alenia
Spacebus 4000C4 carries a Ku, S and C-band communications payload.
Eutelsat W2A separated from the Briz-M stage at 0133 UTC on Apr 4 into a
4990 x 35899 km x 20.7 deg geostationary transfer orbit; intermediate
orbits in the five-burn ascent were -448 x 186 km x 48.0 deg, 132 x 274
km x 48.0 deg,  239 x 5002 km x 46.8 deg, 299 x 14988 km x 46.1 deg and
398 x 35666 km x 45.6 deg. The Briz-M  DTB tank was jettisoned into the
299 x 14988 km orbit at 2002 UTC. By late April, W2A was on station at
1.7 deg E.


WGS SV2
-------

The second Wideband Global Satcom satellite was launched from Cape
Canaveral on Apr 4. The Boeing-702 class satellite will provide
communications for the US Dept. of  Defense. Central Command (CENTCOM).
WGS 2 is believed to now be in geostationary orbit.

Beidou
-------

On Apr 14 China launched the second "second generation" ('erdai')
Beidou navigation satellite, COMPASS-G2 or 'er ke Beidou Daohang Weixing'
using the CZ-3C (Chang Zheng sanhao bing) launch vehicle. The
satellite was initially placed in geostationary transfer orbit.
The first four Beidou were called 'Beidou Daohang Shiyan Weixing',
or Beidou Navigation Test Satellite; the most recent two are the
operational 'Beidou Daohang Weixing'. Beidou is probably now in
geostationary orbit, but no orbital data have been released.

RISAT-2
--------

India's PSLV-C12 launch put the RISAT-2 satellite in orbit on Apr 20.
RISAT-2 is a Tecsar-class radar imaging satellite that India bought from
Israel to make up for delays in the Indian-built RISAT-1.

The PSLV took off at 0115 UTC from the Satish Dhawan Space Center on
Sriharikota Island north of Chennai, and the first three stages placed
the PS4 fourth stage with its payloads on a suborbital trajectory of
about -1000 x 560 km x 20 deg, heading east to avoid Sri Lanka. After a
few minutes coast, the package reached apogee at 0130 UTC over the
equator at 116 deg E, and the PS4 yawed to burn the vehicle into a  more
southerly-bound 400 x 552 km x 41.1 deg orbit. (One source suggests the
yaw burn may be at around 5 deg N rather than on the equator, and
confirmation of details would be appreciated). The third stage reentered
over the ocean east of Australia at around 0146 UTC. After a depletion
burn the fourth stage is in a slightly higher 453 x 559 km orbit.

RISAT-1 separated from the PS4 at 0132 UTC, and two minutes later
Anusat, a small 40 kg imaging satellite from Anna University in Chennai, was
also ejected from the stage.

SICRAL 1B
---------

Italy's second military communications satellite, SICRAL 1B, was
launched on Apr 20 by a Boeing-Sea Launch Zenit-3SL from the floating
Odyssey launch platform in the equatorial Pacific. The satellite was
built at Thales Alenia/Torino. The SICRAL (Sistema Italiano per
Comunicazioni Riservate ed Allarmi, Italian System for Classified
Communications and Alarms) 1B satellite supplements SICRAL 1A launched
in 2001 Feb on an Ariane 4.

SICRAL 1B is an improved Thales Alenia Italsat-3000 design; the
satellite is 7.8m high and the solar panels span 24.4m. Mass is
3038 kg full, 1680 kg dry. (thanks to Guiseppina Piccirilli of Thales
Alenia (I) for details).

The Torino (Turin) plant of Thales Alenia built the ELDO STV satellites
in the 1960s, when it was part of FIAT. In 1969 it became part of
Aeritalia, in 1990 part of Alenia Spazio, in 2005 part of Alcatel Alenia
Space, and in 2007 Thales Alenia.

The Zenit-3SL's lower two stages put the Blok DM-SL upper stage in a
-1949 x 233 km x 0.0 deg trajectory; the two DM burns went to
an elliptical 200 x 14108 km x 0.0 deg intermediate orbit and then
an 8528 x 35596 km x 0.0 high-perigee geostationary transfer orbit.
Three debris objects have been cataloged in the transfer orbit - this
is unusual for Zenit-3SL launches. 

Yaogan 6
---------

China has launched the Yaogan 6 "China remote sensing satellite No. 6"
(Zhongguo yaogan weixing liuhao). It was built by the Shanghai hangtian
jishu yanjiuyuan (Shanghai Academy of Space Technology, SAST), part of
the  Zhongguo hangtian keji jituan gongsi (China Aerospace Research and
Technology Corp., CASC).  

Launch was by CZ-2C. Six objects have been cataloged in orbit, with the
payload raising its orbit from an initial 486 x 521 km x 97.6 deg
to 511 x 513 km x 97.6 deg by Apr 29. The rocket stage is in
a 431 x 583 km orbit; four small debris objects may be the second
stage separation motors.

Kosmos-2450
------------

Kosmos-2450 was launched on a Soyuz-U from Plesetsk on Apr 29 into a 
167 x 335 km x 67 degree orbit. It is probably a Kobal't-M class imaging
reconnaissance satellite. The previous such satellite was Kosmos-2445,
which flew from 2008 Nov 14 to 2009 Feb 23.

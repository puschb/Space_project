Shuttle and Station
--------------------

Space Shuttle OV-104 Atlantis was launched from pad 39A on May 11 at
Kennedy Space Center on mission STS-125, Hubble Servicing Mission SM-4.
Beginning its rendezvous with the Hubble Space Telescope, Atlantis was
initially placed in a 53 x 537 km x 28.5 deg orbit and then, after an
OMS burn at 1845 UTC, into a 201 x 550 km orbit. HST is in a 562 x 568
km x 28.5 deg orbit and was grappled by the RMS arm on  Atlantis at 1714
UTC on May 13. The RMS berthed HST in the payload bay at 1812 UTC. 

The airlock was depressurized at 1248 UTC on May 14 and Grunsfeld and
Feustel opened the hatch at 1251 UTC for the first spacewalk.
The astronauts swapped WFPC2 for the new Wide Field Camera 3 and
replaced the broken science data handling unit.

The second spacewalk, by Massimino and Good on May 15, lasted from 1247
UTC (depress) to 2045 UTC (repress). Three Rate Sensing Units, each with
two gyros, were installed, replacing older ones. Problems with one unit
forced the astronauts to install a backup and caused the spacewalk to
overrun, lasting almost 8 hours. On May 16's EVA-3, Grunsfeld and Feustel
replaced COSTAR with the COS spectrograph and fixed the ACS camera.
Depress to 0.7 psi was at 1331 UTC, hatch open at 1334, closed at 2005,
and repress at 2011 UTC.

During EVA-4 on May 17 Massimino and Good repaired the STIS instrument,
with no time left over for other tasks. Hatch open was 1344 UTC about
two minutes after depressurization; hatch closed at 2139 UTC followed by
repressurization at 2147 UTC. EVA-5 on May 18 featured Grunsfeld and
Feustel again; it began with airlock depressurization at 1217 UTC and
hatch open at 1220 UTC. After a battery replacement and replacement of
one of the Fine Guidance Sensors, the astronauts buttoned up the
telescope and cleaned up the payload bay. Grunsfeld became probably the
last person to touch the telescope, after accidentally knocking into the
spacecraft's low gain antenna.

[Note: NASA measures its Shuttle and Quest spacewalks from the
switch-to-battery event until repressurization; for consistency across
countries, vehicles, and decades, I measure all kinds of spacewalks
using estimates of the 50 mbar (0.7 psi) pressure level, and I also
record hatch open/close times.]

HST was released at 1257 UTC on May 19 after the servicing was complete.
Atlantis fired its OMS engines for deorbit at 1424 UTC on May 24, and
landed at 1539 UTC on Runway 22 at Edwards Air Force Base.

Gennadiy Padalka (Russian Space Agency), Mike Barratt (NASA), and Koichi
Wakata (Japan-JAXA) are aboard the Station with Soyuz TMA-14 docked to
it. Progress M-66 undocked from the station on May 6 at 1518 UTC;
Progress M-02M was launched on May 7 at 1837 UTC and docked with Pirs at
1924 UTC on May 12. On May 27, Roman Romanenko (Russian Space Agency),
Frank DeWinne (European Space Agency) and Bob Thirsk (Canadian Space
Agency) were launched in Soyuz TMA-15. They will dock with the Station
and increase the crew size to its operational level of six.

Following a lead from Igor Lissov, I now consider that  the Dzhezkazgan,
Kazakhstan landing site I mentioned in the last issue should really be
written Zhezqazghan, Qazaqstan, following the CESR standard for the
transcription of the Qazaq alphabet.


Herschel-Planck
---------------

Arianespace launched an Ariane 5ECA from Kourou on May 14. The rocket is
carrying the Herschel and Planck observatories. After the EPC core stage
separated into a mildly suborbital -588 x 267 km x 5.70 orbit, the ESC-A
stage ignited for a long injection burn, sending Planck and Herschel
into a 270 x 1193622 km x 6 deg transfer orbit on the way to the
Earth-Sun L2 Lagrange point.

Observers have detected six objects associated with the H/P launch with
apogees from 1 to 2 million km; only four were expected (Herschel,
Planck, ESC-A and Sylda).


Kosmos-2450
------------

Kosmos-2450 was launched on a Soyuz-U from Plesetsk on Apr 29 into a 67
degree inclination orbit. It is probably a Kobal't-M class imaging
reconnaissance satellite. On May 26 it was in a 178 x 324 km
x 67.1 deg orbit.

STSS-ATRR
---------

The US Missile Defense Agency's STSS ATRR satellite was launched on May
5. Also given the codename USA 205, the Advanced Technology Risk
Reduction satellite is the first launch in the STSS (Space Tracking and
Surveillance System) series. The secret satellite may be using a General
Dynamics (former Spectrum Astro) SA-200 bus, with Northrop Grumman Space
Technology acting as overall system prime contractor; a satellite of
around 2000 kg is a reasonable guess given the launch vehicle and orbit,
although some MDA statements may imply a smaller payload.

The satellite has been found by indepedent observers in a 867 x 878 km x
98.9 deg orbit. The Delta 7920-10C took off at 2024 UTC and reached a
transfer orbit of around 165 x 871 km at 2034 UTC. The second stage
restarted at 2117 UTC over around 44E 26S to enter the 867 x 878 km
target orbit, and then separated from the payload at 2122 UTC. Following
an evasive burn at 2154 UTC and a depletion burn at 2207 UTC over 148W
30N, the empty stage was left in a retrograde orbit of about 250 x 900
km x 112.8 deg, decaying to 232 x 802 km x 112.6 deg by May 10.


Protostar 2
------------

International Launch Services and Khrunichev launched a Proton-M/Briz-M
on May 16 carrying the Protostar 2 satellite. Protostar 2, also known
as Indostar II, will replace Indostar I (Cakrawarta) providing comms
to Indonesia. The satellte is owned by Protostar Ltd., which is
officially based in Bermuda but with offices in the San Francisco area.
The ILS launch annoucments talk of Protostar as a Bermuda
based company; this implies that Protostar I and II should be
registered with the United Nations OOSA by the UK rather than by the US.

Indostar-II/Protostar 2 is a  Boeing 601HP class satellite with a launch
mass of 3905 kg; it is 4.1 x 10 x 26m in size when deployed.

Tacsat 3
--------

Tacsat 3 was launched to a 432 x 467 km x 40.5 deg orbit on May 19. The
USAF experimental imaging satellite used a Minotaur I rocket and was
launched from Wallops Island. Along with the main payload, NASA's
Pharmasat and three small 10-cm cubesats were deployed. The cubesats
were CP6 for Cal Poly, HawkSat-1 for the Hawk Institute for Space
Sciences, and Aerocube 3 for the Aerospace Corp.

Meridian 2
----------

Russia's second Meridian military communications satellite was launched
by Soyuz-Fregat from Plesetsk on May 21 into a 290 x 36460 km x 62.8 deg
orbit. This is lower than the expected 1000 x 39800 km orbit. and
suggests that the second Fregat burn was cut short and the third one did
not occur.  According to a report on the Novosti Kosmonavtiki forum, the
third stage cut off 5s early; the Fregat tried to make up the difference
but ran dry during the second burn at around 2247 UTC. Meridian separated
at 0013 UTC on May 22; the third burn would have been at about 0500 UTC
during first apogee.

TASS indicates that this launch will be given a Kosmos cover name, - it
would be Kosmos-2451 - but Vesti and Interfaks give the Meridian name
explicitly.

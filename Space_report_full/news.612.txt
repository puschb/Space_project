Shuttle and Station
--------------------

Gennadiy Padalka (Commander, Russia), Mike Barratt (Flight Engineer 1,
NASA), and Koichi Wakata (FE2, Japan-JAXA) were joined by Roman
Romanenko (FE3, Russia), Frank DeWinne (FE4, European Space Agency) and
Bob Thirsk (FE5, Canadian Space Agency) when Soyuz TMA-15 docked  with
the Station's Zarya nadir port at 1234 UTC on May 29, increasing the
crew size to its operational level of six and beginning  Expedition 20.
Soyuz TMA-14 and Progress M-02M are also docked to the Station.

On Jun 5, astronauts Padalka and Barratt made Russian spacewalk VKD-22
in the new Orlan-MK spacesuits (Nos. 5 and 6 respectively) from the Pirs
module. Depressurization of Pirs was complete around 0736 UTC, with
hatch open at 0752 UTC. Barrett and Padalka added two Kurs rendezvous
antennas to the exterior of Zvezda  to get it ready for the arrival of a
new docking module, the Maliy Issledovatel'skiy Modul'-2 (MIM-2, Mini
Research Module 2). Also known as Stikovochniy Otsek 2 (SO-2, Docking
Module 2), it is similar in design to the SO-1 Pirs module and will be
launched attached to a Progress propulsion unit, Progress M-SO2 No. 302,
later in 2009.

On Jun 10, Russian spacewalk VKD-23 was carried out inside the Zvezda
module. The front of Zvezda (the part docked to Zarya) is a spherical
node (PKhO, Transfer Module) with multiple docking ports. The axial port
is connected to Zarya; the zenith port of the Pirs airlock module is
docked at  Zvezda's radial nadir port, with Progress M-02M docked to
Pirs' nadir. The ports which are in active use contain conical hatches
used to receive the docking probes of visiting spacecraft; the axial
docking cone used to receive Zarya is no longer needed as Zarya is
firmly attached, but was still attached. The three remaining radial
ports on the Zvezda node were closed off with flat cover plates. During
the Jun 10 operation, astronauts Padalka and Barratt entered the node
and closed the hatches to Zarya and to the main section of Zvezda. The
node was depressurized starting at 0622 UTC and completed by about 0650
UTC. At 0655 UTC the flat cover on the zenith hatch was removed, leaving
the zenith port open to space. It was stowed on top of the Pirs hatch.
At about 0705 UTC the docking cone on the port docked to Zarya was
removed and at 0707 it was installed on the zenith port, closing it off
to space again and preparing it for MIM-2/SO-2. The compartment was then
repressurized at around 0711 UTC; the depressurized work thus lasted
about 21 minutes, but Russian officials count the spacewalk as lasting
12 minutes, the time for which the zenith hatch was open to space.

Launch of STS-127 is now expected in July.


LRO and LCROSS
--------------

The Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO) was launched from Cape Canaveral
on Jun 18 aboard an Atlas V rocket together with LCROSS, the Lunar
Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite. The Centaur AV-020 stage
entered a 180 x 208 km parking orbit and then reignited to reach a 194 x
353700 km x 28.2 deg lunar transfer orbit at 2215 UTC on Jun 18. LRO
separated from the Centaur/LCROSS at 2218 UTC. The Centaur then adjusted
its orbit by venting its remaining propellant, sending it on a slightly
different 133 x 348640 km x 28.0 deg lunar flyby trajectory.
Centaur/LCROSS will pass the Moon at a distance of 3270 km at 1029 UTC
on Jun 23, and enter a 357000 x 582000 km x 45 deg  orbit (LGALRO -
Lunar Gravity Assist Lunar Return Orbit) with apogees on Jul 10, Aug 16
and Sep 22 which will lead to lunar impact on October 9 at around 1139
UTC. LCROSS will separate from the Centaur shortly before the impact.
Meanwhile, LRO is scheduled to enter lunar orbit on Jun 23.

Measat 3a
---------

The Measat 3a communications satellite was launched on Jun 21 from
Baykonur on the third 'Land Launch' Zenit-3SLB. The satellite was
built by Orbital for Measat and will be operated from Cyberjaya, Malaysia.

Meridian 2
----------

As of Jun 20, Meridian 2 was still stuck in its initial, lower than
planned 646-minute transfer orbit.

Herschel and Planck
-------------------

The cryo-cover on the Herschel telescope was opened on Jun 14,
allowing the focal plane instruments to see the sky. First
light images of the galaxy M51 were released on June 19.
Meanwhile, Planck made a course correction on Jun 5 and
is slowly activating its instruments.

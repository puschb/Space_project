Shuttle and Station
--------------------

Endeavor docked to the Station at 1747 UTC on Jul 17. The hatches were
open by 1948 UTC, and at 2122 UTC Tim Kopra replaced Koichi Wakata on
the Expedition 20 crew. During the flight there were a  record 13 people
on board the Station; this also equals the record total number of people
in space at one time (Mar 1995: Soyuz TM-21, Mir, STS-67; Feb 1997:
Soyuz TM-25, Mir, STS-82; Mar 2009: Soyuz TMA-14, ISS, STS-119).

On Jul 18 at 0035, the ISS orbit was boosted slightly to avoid a close
pass with a debris object. Object 84180 is what's known as an 'analyst
object', an object whose orbit and origin aren't well known enough to be
put in the main catalog, and its orbital data are not public.

EVA-1: On Jul 18 at 1613 UTC the Quest airlock was depressurized to 0.7
psi with Dave Wolf in EMU spacesuit 3003 and Tim Kopra in EMU 3005. The
hatch was opened at 1618 UTC, and Kopra and Wolf emerged to install the
JEM Exposed Facility (EF) on the Kibo module. Wolf jettisoned a thermal
cover from Kibo at 1742 UTC. The Station SSRMS arm grappled the EF at
1505 UTC and unberthed it at 1759 UTC. Then, SSRMS handed it to
Endeavour's RMS; the RMS grappled the EF at 1830 UTC, and the SSRMS
released it at 1846 UTC.  The UCCAS structure (for mounting science
experiments) was deployed from the P3 truss at around 2000 UTC, after
having become stuck on a previous mission. The astronauts returned to
the airlock with hatch closed at 2148 UTC and repressurization at 2151
UTC. The EF was connected to the Kibo module starting at 2215 UTC, with
the structure latched at 2247 UTC. 

On Jul 19, the ICC (Integrated Cargo Carrier) was moved from the
Shuttle bay to a storage area on the ISS transporter's MBS (Mobile Base System).
The Shuttle RMS unberthed ICC, and handed it to the Station SSRMS
which installed it.

EVA-2 on Jul 20 saw the transfer of spares from the ICC-VLD truss
to the ESP-3 storage area. Depress was around 1508 UTC with hatch open
at 1524 UTC and battery power at 1527; hatch closed at 2215 and
repressurization at 2220 UTC. The SGANT antenna, a pump module,
and a spare drive unit for the transporter were installed.
The spacewalkers were Tom Marshburn and Dave Wolf, in EMUs 3005 and 3003.

On Jul 21, it was the turn of the Japanese Experiment Logistics Module
Exposed Section (JEM ELM-ES), known more simply as the Japanese
Logistics Element, JLE or "Jelly" for short. JLE was unberthed from
the Shuttle bay and handed off from the Shuttle RMS to the Station SSRMS
which installed it on the end of the Kibo EF. Them the SSRMS 
picked up the ICC from the Mobile Base System and moved it to near
the P6 truss in preparation for EVA-3.

The third EVA, on Jul 22, featured Chris Cassidy in EMU 3018 and
Dave Wolf again in EMU 3003. They depressurized Quest at 1428 UTC and
opened the hatch at 1431 UTC. Cassidy's first stop was the Kibo EF,
where he removed four thermal covers to prepare the EF for experiment
installation. Three of the covers were jettisoned into space,
between 1507 and 1520 UTC, and are cataloged as 1998-67BS, BT, BU.
The fourth cover was returned to the airlock. The rest of the EVA
was carried out at P6, with old batteries in the P6 IEA (Integrated 
Electronics Assembly) being replaced by new ones from the ICC truss.
Cassidy's LiOH unit, used to scrub CO2 from his air supply, malfunctioned
after the astronauts energetic activity, and the spacewalk was cut short
at 2005 UTC with airlock repressurization at 2031 UTC.

The next day saw robot arm work by the Japanese Kibo RMS. The Kibo
arm moved three experiments from the JLE to the EF: MAXI, IOCS and
SEDA-AP. MAXI is an X-ray astronomy all-sky monitor experiment.

On Jul 24, Cassidy and Marshburn, in EMUs 3018 and 3005, went outside
again for EVA-4, to complete the battery replacements on P6. The airlock
was depressurized from 1345 UTC to 2107 UTC. The JLE was moved back to
the Shuttle payload bay on Jul 26. On Jul 27 Cassidy and Marshburn
carried out the final spacewalk, with hatch open at 1132 UTC and repress
at 1627 UTC; they worked on electrical cables on the Z1 truss, thermal
covers on the Dextre robotic manipulator and TV camera installation on
the Kibo EF.

Endeavour undocked at 1726 UTC on Jul 28, leaving the six-strong
Expedition 20 crew on ISS.

The Progress M-67 robot cargo ship was launched on Jul 24  from Baykonur
into a 188 x 236 km x 51.6 deg orbit, soon corrected to a 255 x 310 km orbit.
It docked with the Zvezda aft port at 1112 UTC on Jul 29, following
the departure of STS-127.

On Jul 30 at 1234:30 UTC, the Dragonsat experiment was ejected from a
small launcher in the Shuttle payload bay into a 325 x 332 km orbit.
Dragonsat consists of two small 1.5 kg student-built cubesats, BEVO-1
from UT Austin and Aggiesat 2 by Texas A&M University. The two
satellites are launched attached to each other; they were to be
separated by springs but this failed to occur. The satellites carry GPS
receivers for a test of components for a future  rendezvous system.

On Jul 30 at 1723:02 UTC the ANDE-2 canister was jettisoned from
Endeavour. At 1723:39 the upper canister separated from the lower
and the ANDE Passive satellite separated. At 1723:56
the ANDE center avionics section separated from the lower
canister and the ANDE Active satellite separated.
ANDE Active and Passive are also called Castor and Pollux.
This unimaginative name for twin satellites has been used previously
for the French D-5A/D-5B satellites in May 1975, which also studied
the upper atmosphere.

On Jul 31 Endeavour fired the OMS engines at 1341 UTC to lose 92 m/s,
lowering the orbit to about 17 x 335 km and beginning the journey home.
It landed on runway 15 at Kennedy Space Center at 1448 UTC.
The four thermal covers jettisoned during the mission
reentered between Jul 26 and Aug 2. In addition, the Crew Lock toolbag
lost during a spacewalk in Nov 2008 reentered on Aug 3.
Space Shuttle Discovery and the STS-128 stack rolled out to the launch
pad on Aug 4; launch is scheduled for late August.


Erratum
-------

The name of the Belgian astronaut currently on the Station
is Frank De Winne (not DeWinne as I sloppily wrote in JSR 613.)
Thanks to my Belgian readers for pointing this out!

Sterkh
-------

The first Sterkh search-and-rescue satellite was launched at 0357 UTC on
Jul 21. Russia's contribution to the space based COSPAS-SARSAT search
and rescue system used to be installed together with navigation payloads
on Nadezhda satellites, but have now been moved to the dedicated Sterkh
system. A second satellite, Kosmos-2454, was launched on the same
rocket. It is a Parus satellite, used for military navigation and
communications, and Bob Christy reports signals on a typical Parus
frequency. Orbit of the satellites is 917 x 943 km x 83.0 deg.

The Kosmos-3M rocket entered a transfer orbit at around 0404 UTC. It
reignited at about 0500 UTC to enter a 917 x 943 km orbit; the combined
Sterkh/Parus pair separated from the final stage. Sterkh and Parus
separated from each other at around 1300 to 1430 UTC. Parus
mass is around 800 kg, and Sterkh is around 150 kg.

Dnepr
-----

Kosmotras launched a Yuzhoye-built Dnepr rocket on Jul 29 carrying a
cluster of small satellites. The payloads are Dubaisat 1 (190 kg Korean
SatRec bus) for the Emirates Institute of Advanced Science and
Technology in Dubai; Deimos-1 (90 kg Surrey SSTL-100 bus) for Deimos
Space SL of Madrid; UK DMC-2 (95 kg Surrey SSTL-100 bus) for DMC
International Imaging of Guildford, Surrey; Nanosat-1b, a 22 kg payload
for the Spanish space agency INTA; and AprizeSat-3 and AprizeSat-4, for
SpaceQuest of Fairfax, Virginia. 

SpaceQuest also owns and operates  AprizeSat-1 and 2 (formerly known as
Latinsat C/D). Aprize Satellite, also of Fairfax, is the owner of the
similar SpaceQuest-built Latinsat-A and -B satellites which operate the
Argentine-registerd Latinsat communications network. (Thanks to
Dino Lorenzini for SpaceQuest for clarifying this).


The objects cataloged in orbit appear to be:

   A  Deimos 1      634 x 677 km
   B  Dubaisat-1    665 x 681 km
   C  UK DMC-2      623 x 677 km
   D  Aprizesat 4   606 x 677 km
   E  Nanosat 1B    586 x 677 km
   F  Aprizesat 3   565 x 677 km
   G  Dnepr gas-dynamic shield  541 x  678 km
   H  Dnepr rocket stage        668 x 1302 km
   J  Upper payload platform    641 x  677 km

The Dnepr rocket carries on burning as the satellites are dispensed,
so they end up at different heights and the rocket stage ends up with
a higher apogee.


Kosmos-2450
-----------

Russia's latest Kobal't-M spy satellite landed on Jul 27 after
an 89-day mission.

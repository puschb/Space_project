Shuttle and Station
--------------------

After Atlantis returned to Earth, remaining on the Station were
commander Jeff Williams (NASA) and astronauts Frank De Winne
(ESA/Belgium), Robert Thirsk (CSA/Canada), Roman Romanenko (FKA/Russia),
and Maksim Suraev (FKA/Russia). Expedition 22 began at 1500 UTC on Nov
24; Williams assumed command from De Winne at 1812 UTC. 

On Dec 1 at 0356 UTC Romanenko, De Winne and Thirsk undocked from
Station aboard Soyuz TMA-15, which had been docked to the Zarya
nadir port since May 29.  The deorbit engine was fired at 0626 UTC.
Soyuz TMA-15 landed at 0715:34 UTC.

The MIM-2 Poisk module was launched to the Station using a Progress
service module or 'priborno-agregatniy otsek' (PAO) as its propulsion
unit. The combination was called Progress M-MIM2. On Dec 8 at 0016 UTC,
the Progress M-MIM2 PAO separated from the Poisk, leaving the latter's
docking port available for use by visiting vehicles. Three orbits later,
at 0448 UTC, the PAO main engine fired for its deorbit burn and the PAO
reentered over the Pacific at 0527 UTC. [Although the PAO flew separately
for three complete orbits, no new entry was added to the satellite
catalog and it appears  that no decay notice for 36086 (2009-060A) has
been issued. As orbits were issued for 36086 on Dec 12 and 13, it can be
assumed that 36086 continues to refer to the Poisk module and that
the PAO has so far been omitted from the catalog.]

WISE
----

NASA's Wide Field Infrared Explorer (WISE) astronomy satellite was
launched from Vandenberg on Dec 14 aboard a two-stage Delta II into a
524 x 533 km x 97,5 deg orbit. If all goes well, WISE will pop its
telescope cover off in late December and begin an infrared all-sky
survey at 3.4, 4.6, 12 and 22 microns. For the time being, astronomers
are still working with the 1983 IRAS survey, although the results from
the Japanese Akari satellite which surveyed the sky at 10, 20, 60 and
170 microns are expected to be public soon. WISE will catalog sources
100 times fainter than either previous satellite. The spacecraft has a
40cm telescope cooled to 12K by a cryostat filled with solid hydrogen.
PI for the mission is Ned Wright of UCLA, whose work I've followed since
my thesis days at Cambridge studying high-redshift cosmic dust, a
subject Ned's the expert on. The science team includes galaxy expert
Pete Eisenhardt, who I only just discovered overlapped with me in
Cambridge, and brown-dwarf-fan and instrument-builder-extraordinaire Amy
Mainzer. WISE will be returning key data on all these specialties -
here's wishing the best of luck to the team!


IGS
---

Japan's latest Information Gathering Satellite, the Optical-3 vehicle,
was launched on Nov 28 by H-IIA serial number 16. The IGS is an
imaging spy satellite operated by the Cabinet Satellite Intelligence Center.

Intelsat IS-15
--------------

IS-15 was launched by Land Launch Zenit-3SLB from Baykonur on Nov 30.
The satellite is an Orbital Star-2 and will provide services to Russia,
the Middle East and the Indian Ocean region.

The first two burns of the 3SLB put IS-15 in a 200 x 35907 km x 48.9 deg
transfer orbit; a final third burn occurred at 0314 UTC.
By Dec 13 IS-15 was in a 35797 x 35791 km orbit at 63.2E.

Eutelsat W7
------------

Eutelsat W7 had reached a 10726 x 35609 km x 12.2 deg orbit by Nov 26;
when next tracked, on Dec 16, the object was in a 35785 x 35787 km x 0.1
deg geostationary orbit at 50.1E.

Several other Eutelsat satellites were relocated recently. Hot Bird 2,
launched in 1996 and renamed Eurobird 9 in 2007, was moved from 9E to 48E 
and renamed again to Eutelsat W48. Hot Bird 3, launched in 1997
and renamed Eurobird 4 earlier this year, was relocated to 75E
as part of a deal with Asia Broadcast Satellite and re-renamed W75/ABS-1B.
There have been a large number of satellite on-orbit resales and renamings,
and one of these days I may make a comprehensive table of them,
but it will have to be a much less busy day than any I've had lately.

WGS 3
-----

The third Wideband Global Satcom was launched on Dec 6 on a Delta 4 into
supersynchronous transfer orbit of around 439 x 66981 km x 24.0 deg. The
5990 kg Boeing 702-class satellite is managed by the USAF and operated
by Space Command/Schriever AFB; it carries US Army-led X-band and
Ka-band communications payloads. The satellite is also designated
USA 211.

Yaogan Weixing 7
----------------

China launched a Yaogan Weixing on Dec 9: 'yaogan weixing qihao',
Remote-Sensing Satellite Number 7 appears to be similar to YW-2 and
YW-4, which are thought to have been imaging satellites. Orbit of YW-7
is 623 x 659 km x 97.8 deg.

Yaogan Weixing 8
----------------

On Dec 15, another Yaogan launch, this time from the Taiyuan space
center. YW-8 ('yaogan weixing bahao') is in a 1192 x 1204 km x 100.5 deg
sun-synchronous orbit, a new  orbital regime for Chinese satellites. It
is probably a low resolution imaging satellite, either for civilian
Earth resource studies or military weather forecasting - Western
analysts have suspected that previous YW satellites had an at least
partly military mission.

The 50 kg amateur radio satellite Xi Wang 1 was also placed in orbit.

Russian missile tests
---------------------

Widespread reports of a strange spiral in the sky over Norway on Dec 9
were due to the Russian Navy's Bulava missile test. It has been
suggested that the third stage lost guidance and began to spiral during
its rocket burn. Jim Oberg has suggested that the spiral pattern could
even have been a deliberate evasive maneuver in a test of technology to
defeat US missile defense; I can't rule that out, but I feel it's
unlikely. Russian authorities finally confirmed the failed launch on Dec
10. The Russian Rocket Forces had more success than the Navy the next
day, when Topol', the land-based sibling of Bulava, made a successful flight
from Kapustin Yar to Sary Shagan.

GLONASS
--------

Three Uragan-M navigation satellites, Nos. 730, 733, 734 were launched on
Dec 14 to supplement the GLONASS navigation system. As usual, they 
have been given code names in the Kosmos series, Kosmos-2456 to 2458.
Launch was on a Proton with the now-rarely-used Blok DM-2 upper stage.
The satellites are in 19130 x 19140 km x 64.8 deg orbits.

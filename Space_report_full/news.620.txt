A happy 2010 to all my readers! Those of you at the American Astronomical
Society next week, please stop by the Chandra booth and say hi.

Shuttle and Station
--------------------

Soyuz TMA-17 was launched on Dec 20 carrying Oleg Kotov, T.J. Creamer
and Soichi Noguchi on their way to join Expedition 22 crewmembers Jeff
Williams and Maksim Suraev. TMA-17 is spacecraft article 11F732A17
factory model 7K-STMA No. 227,  carrying out ISS mission 21S.

On Dec 22 at 2248 UTC Soyuz TMA-17 docked with the nadir port on Zarya.
Soyuz TMA-16 is at Zvezda's aft port, the Progress M-03M cargo
ship is at the Pirs port, and the Poisk and PMA-2 ports are empty.


Helios IIB
---------

France's Helios IIB spy satellite was launched on Dec 18. The 4200 kg
craft is based on the SPOT remote sensing satellites and is probably in
a 680 km sun-synchronous orbit. In a new policy, the US has stopped
releasing the orbital elements of French military satellites.

The launch vehicle was production no. L532, an old Ariane 5GS model with
an EPS upper stage. Only two of the last 23 launches have used the 5GS
model rather than the enhanced 5ECA with the cryogenic ESC-A upper
stage. Based on public information and comparison with other polar
Ariane missions, I conclude that the EPC core stage, which separated 400
km above -53W 20N at 1635 UTC, probably entered an orbit of
approximately -2690 x 800 km x 90.9 deg, reaching apogee over
Newfoundland at 1644 UTC and reentering over the North Pole at 1657 UTC.
The EPS stage burned from 1635 to 1652 UTC and entered an estimated 665
x 665 km x 98.3 deg orbit over Baffin Island, coasting half an orbit
until Helios IIB separated from it at 1725 UTC over the Indian Ocean
north of the ground station at Perth.


WISE
----

After the WISE infrared astronomical observatory separated into a 526 x
531 km x 97.5 deg orbit, its Delta rocket second stage depleted the rest
of its fuel with an extra pair of burns that put the empty stage in a
2113 x 11086 km x 97.5 deg disposal orbit, unusually high for a Delta II.

WISE ejected its telescope cover at 2230 UTC on Dec 29 into a marginally lower 
525 x 531 km orbit, and is now ready to begin observing.


DirectTV 12
-----------

DirecTV 12 is a 5900 kg Boeing 702 satellite for television
broadcasting. It was launched by Proton-M on Dec 29 into a -386 x 173 km
x 48.0 deg marginally suborbital trajectory. The Briz-M stage then made
five burns to 133 x 273 km x 48 deg, 245 x 5000 km x 47 deg, 310 x 15387 km
x 46 deg, 405 x 35816 km x 46 deg, and 5120 x 35786 km x 20.7 deg,
where the payload separated.

Russian missile
---------------

Russia carried out its third long range missile test of the month on Dec
24, with the launch of an R-36M2 'Voevoda' from the missile base at
Yasniy (also known as Dombarovskiy) which has also been used for Dnepr
satellite launches. The R-36M2, or 15A18M, is related to the Tsiklon and
Dnepr launch vehicles and is made by the Ukranian Yuzhnoe company; it
carries ten MIRVed reentry vehicles. The rocket's NATO designation is
SS-18. The reentry vehicles landed in the usual Kura target range in
Kamchatka, which has been repeatedly  pummeled by ICBM dummy warheads
since 1957. This is the sixth know rocket launch from Yasniy.

Object 5426 - not part of a Soviet lunar lander after all
---------------------------------------------------------

US satellite catalog entry number SSN 5426 is in a 622 x 744 km x 49.5
deg orbit; it has a small radar cross section and a slow decay rate, so
it is probably a small, dense object. It currently sports the
international designation 1971-069C, which alleges its connection with
the Soviet T2K lunar lander test flight Kosmos-434 (SSN 5407), but  I
think this is probably a misidentification. Because of the interest in
reconstructing the Soviet lunar mission flight profiles, it's worth
sorting this out.

Kosmos-434 was launched by a Soyuz rocket into low 189 x 267 km orbit.
The lunar module's engine made a burn simulating the lunar landing burn,
putting it in elliptical orbit of 190 x 1261 km. It then jettisoned its
landing leg section and other debris and made another burn to a 180 x
11834 km orbit in a simulation of lunar ascent.

The first few historical element sets for 5426 were indeed a debris
object from Kosmos-434, in a 183 x 1196 km x 51.7 deg elliptical orbit
similar to SSN 5427 and SSN 5428. Like those objects, it probably
reentered in Sep-Oct 1971, but on Sep 1 the number was reassigned
(probably due to a radar tagging mistake as the two objects crossed
paths) to the current object, which at that time was in a 700 x 925 km x
49.6 deg orbit. What could SSN 5426 be? The most likely answer is  a
despin weight associated with the French Eole satellite, launched by a
US Scout rocket into a 676 x 905 km x 50.1 deg orbit in mid-Aug 1971.
The orbital period is about right and the ascending node is spot on. The
small change in inclination corresponds to a velocity change of about
100 m/s which is of the same order as the other Eole debris object, SSN
5440/1971-71C. I conclude that SSN 5426 and SSN 5440 are the two despin
weights known to have been ejected from the Eole satellite at 1855 UTC
on 1971 Aug 16, and that SSN 5426 should be 1971-071D, not 1971-069C.

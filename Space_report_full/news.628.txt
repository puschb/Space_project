Shuttle and Station
--------------------

On the station, Soyuz TMA-17 switched parking spots, and Atlantis made its
final visit to add the Rassvet module and replace some batteries.

Astronauts Kotov, Creamer and Noguchi flew Soyuz TMA-17 from Zarya to
Zvezda on May 12. They undocked from the Zarya nadir port at 1326 UTC,
retreated to a distance of 50m by 1335 UTC, flew around to 50m from
Zvezda by 1341 UTC. After stationkeeping for a few minutes they began
final approach at 1348 UTC and docked with the aft Zvezda port at 1353
UTC. This left the Zarya port ready to receive the Rassvet module when
it was delivered by Atlantis.

Atlantis took off from Kennedy Space Center on May 14 at 1820 UTC. The
SRBs separated two minutes after launch. Main engine cutoff and external
tank separation followed at 1828 UTC, with Atlantis and the ET in a 58 x
219 km x 51.6 deg orbit. The OMS-2 burn at 1858 UTC raised the orbit of
Atlantis to 157 x 228 km, and over the next two days the Shuttle raised its
orbit to match the 340 x 353 km path of ISS.

Atlantis docked with the PMA-2 port on the station at 1428 UTC on May
16. The Station robot arm took the ICC-VLD carrier from the payload bay
and stowed it on the transporter base overnight. On May 17 at 1151 UTC
the Quest airlock was depressurized past 50 mbar at the beginning of the
first spacewalk by Garrett Reisman and Steve Bowen, during which the
astronauts installed a new SGANT (Space-to-Ground Antenna) on the Z1
truss and the EOTP equipment platform on the Dextre robot. On May 18 at
1220 UTC the Rassvet module was connected to the nadir port on Zarya. On
May 19 EVA-2 with Bowen and Good from 1036 UTC to 1747 UTC and on May 21
EVA-3 with Good and Reisman from 1024 to 1713 UTC saw the successful
replacement of six batteries on the P6 truss. The station truss
has 48 replaceable 170-kg battery packs, 12 on each of the S4, P4, S6 and P6
truss segments. P6 was launched seven years earlier than the other segments
and its batteries are aging, so six of them were replaced on mission STS-127
last year and the other six were swapped out this time.

The Station arm put the ICC-VLD back in the Shuttle's payload bay at
0950 UTC on May 22. Atlantis undocked at 1522 UTC on May 23 and landed
on runway 33 at Kennedy Space Center at 1248 UTC on May 26, completing
mission STS-132, which was (at least according to the current plan) its
final flight in space.

In the Vehicle Assembly Building, solid rocket motors RSRM-112 are being
stacked on the launch platform while external tank ET-137 is being 
prepared nearby, and next door, in Orbiter Processing Facility 3 (OPF 3),
OV-103 Discovery is being kitted out for mission STS-133 which will
probably fly late this year. The final Shuttle mission, STS-134, 
will use orbiter OV-105 Endeavour, now in OPF 2. Its launch will probably
slip to early in 2011.


X-37B
-----

One month after it was launched, hobbyist observers Kevin Fetter and
Greg Roberts have located the secret X-37B spaceplane in a 399 x 419 km
x 40.0 deg orbit.


Akatsuki
--------

Japan's PLANET-C (`puranetto-c') Venus probe, Akatsuki, was launched from
Tanegashima on May 20 at 2158 UTC. Akatsuki is Japanese for 'Dawn'
or 'Daybreak' - just like the Russian 'Rassvet', a popular spacecraft
name this week it seems.

Launch was by H-IIA 202 rocket, flight F17. F17 reached a 292 x 306 km x
30.0 deg low Earth orbit at 2210 UTC and deployed three cubesats:
KSAT for Kagoshima University, Negai* ("Negai-star" but always written
with a star symbol) for Soka University in Tokyo, and Waseda-Sat 2 for
Waseda University in Tokyo. KSAT carries an experiment to study
atmospheric water vapor.

The three cubesats have been cataloged in 290 x 305 km x 30.0 deg orbits.

F17's second stage restarted at 2220 UTC to accelerate to escape
velocity. It cutoff at 2224 UTC, and then deployed three spacecraft
into a 0.72 x 1.07 AU x 2.0 deg solar orbit: Akatsuki, Unitec-1 and Ikaros.
Unitec-1 will space-qualify university-built spacecraft computers;
Ikaros will test a solar sail; and Akatsuki will become a Venus-orbiting
weather satellite with visible, infrared and ultraviolet cameras. The
PAF900M adapter separating Akatsuki and Ikaros was jettisoned
into solar orbit.

Ariane V194
-----------

Arianespace launched Ariane 5ECA vehicle L551 on May 21. Flight number
V194 placed the Astra 3B and ComsatBw-2 communications satellites.
in transfer orbit. The L551 core stage reached a -971 x 173 km x 6.5
deg suborbital path and the ESC-A stage put the satellites
in a 263 x 35764 km x 3.0 deg transfer orbit.

Astra 3B is an Astrium Eurostar 3000 satellite with Ku- and Ka-band
transponders and supplements SES Astra's service at 23E.  Launch mass is
5471 kg; dry mass is probably around 3000 kg. The smaller COMSATBw-2
(launch mass 2440 kg, dry 1040 kg) is a TAS-F Spacebus 3000B2 satellite
with SHF, UHF and Ku-band communications systems for the Bundeswehr
(German armed forces).

Artemis
-------

I have been remiss in not keeping up to date with the Artemis lunar
mission. Two of NASA's five Earth orbiting THEMIS spacecraft, THEMIS B and
C, were coopted for ARTEMIS following the end of their primary
magnetospheric research missions. Their onboard propulsion systems were
used to raise their orbits starting last July, and they are now both
operating beyond the orbit of the Moon. THEMIS B made lunar flybys on Jan 31 and
Feb 13, and THEMIS C made a lunar flyby on Mar 28. The THEMIS and ARTEMIS
missions are led by a team at University of California-Berkeley.
The spacecraft will study the solar wind, the distant magnetotail, and the
lunar wake, and will end up in lunar orbit.

Here is data based mostly on the GSFC SSC Locator orbit tool;
it differs somewhat from the information on the ARTEMIS team's
web pages at Berkeley.

Suborbital flights
------------------

Taiwan launched a suborbital ionospheric payload on May 5; India tested
the Agni missile on May 17. Another MARTI target for the Airborne Laser
project was launched on a NASA Black Brant from San Nicholas Island off
the California coast on May 3. NASA 36.270UG was launched from White
Sands on May 21 carrying the University of Colorado's Diffuse
Interstellar Cloud Experiment (DICE), which uses a far-ultraviolet
spectrograph to detect absorption along the line of sight to two stars.

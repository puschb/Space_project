Shuttle and Station
-------------------

Soyuz TMA-18, Soyuz TMA-19, Progress M-05M, and Progress M-07M
are docked to the ISS.

On Aug 11 Wheelock and Caldwell-Dyson made a second spacewalk from the Quest
airlock to change out the S1 pump module. The old pump was removed from
the truss and carried to a storage point, the POA (Payload and ORU
Accommodation) unit on the Mobile Base System. The astronauts also prepared
the new pump module on the ESP-2 platform. The airlock was depressurized
at 1221 UTC with hatch open from 1226 to 1936 UTC, and repress at 1954 UTC.

A third spacewalk on Aug 17 [ERRATUM: AUG 16] completed the work, with pump module S/N 004
moved from ESP-2 and installed in the S1 truss. The Quest hatch was opened
at 1019 UTC and closed at 1737 UTC, with repressurization at 1740 UTC.
The failed pump module, S/N 002, is still stashed on the MBS POA and will
remain there for the time being. (If someone knows the serial numbers
for the PMs on P1 and ESP-3, please let me know.)

Progress M-06M undocked from Zvezda at 1121 UTC on Aug 31 to begin the
free flying part of its mission. It was deorbited at 1213 UTC on Sep 6.
Progress M-07M was launched on Sep 10 and docked with Zvezda at 1158 UTC
on Sep 12.

Tango
------

Sweden's Prisma Target satellite, Tango, separated from the main Prisma 
satellite Mango on Aug 11 at 1751 UTC to begin formation flying experiments.
Note that the European Space Agency's Cluster FM8 satellite is also
called Tango. Prisma-Tango is in a 784 x 787 km x 98.3 deg orbit;
Cluster-Tango is in a 1856 x 130941 km x 129.6 deg orbit, close to
its dance partners Samba, Salsa and Rumba.

AEHF
----

The US Air Force's first Advanced EHF communications satellite was
launched on Aug 14.  AEHF 1 is a Lockheed Martin A2100M satellite with a
launch mass of around 6200 kg. The AEHF constellation's SHF and EHF
communications payloads will replace the Milstar satellite system
launched in the 1990s.

AEHF 1's Lockheed Martin/ULA Atlas V launch vehicle AV-019 was a model
531 variant with three strapon solid motors; the first burn of the
Centaur upper stage reached a 167 x 1281 km x 27.8 deg orbit at 1121
UTC. Centaur restart at 1129 UTC pushed AEHF 1 into a 221 x 50179  km x
22.2 deg deployment orbit. Large burns with the liquid bipropellant
apogee thruster was intended to raise the orbit initially followed by
several months of burns from AEHF 1's Hall-thruster electric propulsion
system. However, the bipropellant thruster cannot be operated and instead a
series of small burns with a lower thrust monopropellant hydrazine
engine, using the same hydrazine tank, will be needed. 

Many A2100 class satellites have used AMPAC's LEROS 1 engine, but  AEHF
1 uses a different brand of apogee thruster, the BT-4 developed by
Japan's IHI Aerospace. This thruster is also flown on Orbital's Star 2
satellites. Investigation has not yet revealed whether the fault
is in the thruster itself or some other part of the propulsion system
that interacts with the thruster.

According to Ted Molczan on the SeeSat list, hobbyists have 
tracked AEHF following six hydrazine burns to date; on Sep 7 AEHF 1
was in a 1146 x 49994 km x 20.0 deg orbit; on Sep 20 it was
in a 4546 x 49981 km x 15.4 deg orbit.


Tianhui
-------

The Tianhui yi hao weixing (Mapping Satellite 1) was launched from
Jiuquan on Aug 24. The satellite was built by the Hangtian Dongfanghong
Weixing YG (Spaceflight East Is Red Satellite Corp.) and is for
research, mapping and land resource surveys. On Sep 21 it was in a 486 x
504 km x 97.4 deg orbit.

SJ-12
-----

China's Shi Jian 12 satellite, which was launched into a 600 km polar
orbit on Jun 15, carried out a close pass with the SJ-6/3A (Shijian 
liuhao sanzu A xing) satellite on Aug 19. Igor Lissov has pointed out
that SJ-6/3A showed a very small orbital period increase following the pass,
indicating that the spacecraft may have come into physical contact.
On Sep 21 SJ-12 was in a 580 x 606 km x 97.8 deg orbit.

Glonass
-------

Three Uragan-M satellites, probably Nos. 736 to 738, were launched from
Baykonur on Sep 2 to supplement the Glonass navigation constellation.
They will probably be given the cover names Kosmos-2464 to 2466. The
Proton-M launch vehicle placed the DM-2 upper stage in a 155 x 176 km
parking orbit; after two burns the payloads were deployed in a 19115 x
19140 km x 64.8 deg  orbit.

Zhongxing 6A
------------

The Zhongxing (Chinasat) 6A satellite, also known as Xinnuo liuhao 
(Sinosat 6) was launched on Sep 4 by Chang Zheng 3B from Xichang into a
197 x 41886 km x 25.2 deg geostationary transfer orbit. The DFH-4 class
satellite was built by CAST/Beijing for Zhongguo weixingtongxin
jituangongsi (China Satcom Group). It carries C and Ku band
communications payloads. The Sinosat broadcasting satellites Xinnuo 1
and 3, previously operated by the Xinnuo weixing TG, have been renamed
Zhongxing 5B and 5C since that company's merger into China Satcom.
Xinnuo 2 was retired in 2008 and decommissioned in Nov 2009.
By Sep 21 Zhongxing 6A was in a 35775 x 35798 km x 0.4 deg orbit at 126E.

Gonets
-------

Three small Strela-3/Gonets-class satellites were launched into 1497 x
1507 km x 82.5 deg orbits on Sep 8. One is a civilian Gonets-M;
the other two, given Kosmos names, are a 17F13 Strela-3
and the newer 14F132 model (Strela-3M or Rodnik?), and are
part of the corresponding military constellation. The
satellites were launched by the Rokot vehicle, which is based on
Khrunichev's UR-100NU missile (known as the SS-19 in the West) with a
Briz-KM upper stage. This is the 15th orbital Rokot launch and the 5th
since the start of 2009, reflecting an increased flight rate as the
Kosmos-3M and Tsiklon-3 are phased out.

QZSS
----

Japan's first Quasi-Zenith Satellite System craft (Jun tenchou eisei
shogou ki, QZSS 1), was launched on Sep 11.  QZSS 1 is named 'Michibiki'
('guiding light'). It carries an L-band navigation payload to augment
GPS and a C-band payload for communications; the satellite's special
inclined geosynchronous orbit will spend time directly overhead Japan,
providing a better signal to receivers whose view of GEO satellites on
the southern horizon is blocked by tall buildings. The satellite is 4100
kg wet, 1800 kg dry and was built by Mitsubishi Electric (MELCO)
at Kamakura. The satellite is controlled by JAXA from a ground
station on Okinawa. The H-IIA rocket put QZSS in a roughly 280 x 280 km
x 31.8 deg parking orbit at 1129 UTC; after a second burn at 1141 UTC
the satellite was deployed into a 280 x 35336 km x 31.8 deg path; the on
board engine was then used to circularize the trajectory and increase the
inclination.By Sep 20 Michibiki was in a 32065 x 38982 km x 41.0 deg
orbit with a period of 23h 42min.

Suborbital flights
------------------

The RAISE (Rapid Acquisition Imaging Spectropgraph) instrument was
launched from White Sands on Aug 23 as flight NASA 36.219US. RAISE was
developed by Don Hassler of SWRI and Glenn Laurent of U. Colorado to
take ultraviolet spectra of the Sun. On Aug 20, Iran launched Qiam-1,
thought to be a modified version of the Shahab-2 missile with a new
guidance system and no tail fins.

Japan's JAXA launched the T-REX (Tether Technology Rocket Experiment)
payload on a single stage S-520 rocket from the Uchinoura Space Center
at Kagoshima on Aug 30. The 580 kg payload separated into three
components: 'mother' and 'daughter' spacecraft separated by
a 300-meter-long electrodynamic tether, and the small Tethered Space Robot
connected to the daughter, I believe by another, smaller tether. The payloads
fell in the Pacific after a ten-minute flight.

On Sep 17, the USAF launched a Minuteman missile with a single reentry vehicle
(either a Mk 12 or a Mk 21) on a suborbital flight from Vandenberg to
an ocean impact area 320 km southwest of Guam.

On Sep 21, NASA launched the SubTEC-III technology experiment package
on a Terrier Orion from Wallops.

Resurs-DK
---------

The Resurs-DK satellite, which has been in a 355 x 573 km orbit since
shortly after its launch in 2006 Jun, raised its orbit at around 1656
UTC on Sep 10 to a circular 567 x 573 km x 69.9 deg. Resurs-DK
is a Russian remote sensing satellite; it also carries the Italian
PAMELA antimatter detector.

USA 215
-------

Lockheed Martin's Atlas AV-025 was launched from Vandenberg Air Force
Base on Sep 21, carrying the National Reconnaissance Office's USA 215
(NROL-41) payload into a retrograde low Earth orbit. It is suspected
that the payload may be a radar imaging satellite. The Centaur
second stage was probably deorbited over the South Pacific on the
first orbit.

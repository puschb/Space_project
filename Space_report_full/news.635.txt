----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Shuttle and Station
-------------------

Astronauts Yurchikin, Wheelock and Walker left the Station aboard Soyuz
TMA-19 on Nov 26. They undocked from Rassvet at 0123 UTC concluding
Expedition 25 after 62.0 days. The Soyuz deorbit burn was at 0355 UTC
and landing in Kazakhstan at 0446 UTC. There were some problems with the
pressure in the descent module, but the crew landed safely.

Expedition 26 is now underway with crew commander Scott Kelly,  flight engineer-2
Aleksandr Kaleri and flight engineer-3 Oleg Skripochka remaining on the
Station. Soyuz TMA-01M is docked at Poisk, Progress M-07M at Zvezda, and
Progress M-08M at Pirs.

STP S26
-------

As part of the USAF Space Test Program, STP mission S26 was launched
from Kodiak, Alaska on Nov 20 carrying a set of small payloads into orbit.

STPSat-2 is a 135 kg Ball/AeroAstro SIV satellite with technology experiments.

Falconsat 5 is a 161 kg US Air Force Academy satellite carrying experiments
to study plasma and the ionosphere.

FASTRAC 1 and 2 are 30 kg satellites developed by the University of Texas
at Austin with USAF fuding for formation flying experiments.

Fastsat-HSV was developed by NASA-Marshall and companies in Huntsville, Alabama
and carries ionospheric and atmospheric experiments, a USAF experiment, and
the Nanosail-D2 which will be ejected in about a week to deploy a 3-meter-size
solar sail.

The Radio Aurora Explorer is the National Science Foundation's first satellite,
a 3kg 3U cubesat built by the University of Michigan to study the aurora 
by picking up ground-based radar signals.

O/OREOS is a 5 kg 3U cubesat for NASA's Ames Research Center carrying life
sciences experiments to study microbes in free fall and the effects of
ultraviolet light on organic materials.

The Minotaur's GCA (Guidance Control Assembly) fourth stage achieved a
637 x 661 km x 72 deg orbit using its Orion 38 solid motor. A HAPS
(Hydrazine auxiliary propulsion system) fifth stage was mounted on it,
with the primary payloads attached to a Multi Payload Adapter mounting
plate on top of that. After deployment of the payloads, the HAPS
separated from the GCA, made two rocket burns, and then released two
ballast masses in a higher (circa 1200 km) orbit, demonstrating the
capability of the Minotaur IV to deliver payloads to multiple orbits in
a single mission.

NROL-32
-------

The National Reconnaissance Office NROL-32 mission was launched from
Cape Canaveral on Nov 22. It placed a secret satellite in orbit;
I concur with the majority of analysts that it is probably a
geostationary signals intelligence satellite.

ZX-20A
------

China launched the Zhongxing-20A military communications satellite on
Nov 24. Meanwhile, the Beidou DW6 navigation satellite launched on Oct
31 is now in a 35774 x 35797 km x 1.8 deg geostationary orbit at 160.0E,
and the SJ-12 satellite has begun a rendezvous with the SJ-6/4A (SSN 37180)
satellite, following its inspection of SJ-6/3B in Aug-Sep.

Arianespace
------------

Ariane vehicle L556, mission V198, placed two communications satellites
in orbit. The Intelsat IS-17 is a Loral LS-1300-Omega with a launch mass
of 5540 kg and a dry mass of 2393 kg, carrying Ku and C band payloads.
It will be stationed over the Indian Ocean at 66E. Hylas 1, for the UK
company Avanti Communications, is an Indian ISRO I2K satellite with an
advanced Astrium-UK communications payload. Hylas, much smaller than IS-17,
has a mass of 2570 kg full, 1125 kg dry and has a Ka-band payload for
European broadband service. Its stubby solar panels probably only have a
span of 9 meters rather than the 36 m incorrectly reported by the EADS
and Ariane press kits.

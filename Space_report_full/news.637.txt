Editorial note: the JSR website planet4589.org has just been moved to a new
server. This should be transparent, but there may be transition problems;
we will now discover if I have learnt to configure the mail server correctly.

Shuttle and Station
-------------------

Expedition 26 is now underway with crew commander Scott Kelly,  flight
engineer-2 Aleksandr Kaleri, flight engineer-3 Oleg Skripochka, flight
engineer-4 Dmitri Kondratev, flight engineer-5 Paolo Nespoli and flight
engineer-6 Cady Coleman aboard the Station. Soyuz TMA-01M is docked at
Poisk, Progress M-07M at Zvezda, and Soyuz TMA-20 at Rassvet.

On Jan 21 Kondratev (in spacesuit Orlan-MK No. 5) and Skripochka (in
suit No. 4) made a spacewalk to install television equipment on Zvezda
and Rassvet and to retrieve exposed experiments. They depressurized the
Pirs airlock around 1409 UTC, and opened the hatch at 1429 UTC. At 1653
and 1654 UTC they jettisoned a cable reel and an antenna cover
(cataloged as 1998-67CC and 1998-67CD). They returned to Pirs and closed
the hatch at 1952 UTC, repressurizing shortly afterwards. (Thanks to
Andrey Krasil'nikov for the IDs on the suits).

On Jan 22 the second H-II Transfer Vehicle, "Kounotori" 2 gouki ("White
Stork" Unit 2) was launched from Japan's Tanegashima Space Center on the
second H-IIB rocket. The 16000 kg spacecraft  will link up with the
station and deliver cargo. The H-IIB used Pad 2 of the Yoshinobu
complex; Pad 1 is used for the H-IIA. Tanegashima also has two other
launch sites, Osaki and Takesaki, now retired. Osaki had pads for the N
and Q rockets, while Takesaki had launchers for small rockets.

Progress M-08M undocked from Pirs at 0042 UTC on Jan 24 and was deorbited
over the Pacific at 0516 UTC.


Nanosail-D2
-----------

The Nanosail-D2 experiment launched in November has belatedly ejected
itself from FASTSAT. The ejection occurred at 0300 UTC Jan 18, according
to the mission web site at Santa Clara University. The satellite has
not yet been cataloged. The solar sail was deployed on Jan 21 at around 
0400 UTC.

Elektro-L
---------

Russia's new Elektro-L weather satellite was launched on Jan 20 at 1229
UTC. The Zenit-3SLBF launch vehicle consists of a two-stage Zenit-2SB80
booster and the Fregat-SB upper stage, with an additional SBB
(Sbrasivaemiye baki banov, separable propellant tanks) section compared
to the original Fregat. The Zenit-2SB80 second stage reached a 179 x 620
km x 51.4 deg orbit; the Fregat upper stage separated as the second
stage fired retrockets and jettisoned four separation motor covers into
190 x 850 km orbits. The first Fregat burn reached 298 x 4406 km x 50.4
deg, after which the SBB separated. At 1558 UTC the Fregat then made a
burn to 356 x 35753 km x 48.5 deg geostationary transfer orbit. A third
Fregat burn at 2119 UTC put the spacecraft in a 35627 x 35870 km x 0.46
deg geosynchronous orbit over the Indian Ocean. Fregat then separated
and was placed in a subsynchronous drift orbit of 34195 x 35718 km with
a final burn.

Elektro-L is the first use of the Lavochkin company's new Navigator
bus, also to be used for future science satellites. The spacecraft
carries a scanning visible/infrared radiometer, solar environment
monitors and a COSPAS-SARSAT search-and-rescue transponder system.
Spacecraft mass at launch is around 1700 kg.

NRO satellite
-------------

A US National Reconnaissance Office satellite, codenamed USA 224, was
launched from Vandenberg AFB on Jan 20 aboard a Delta 4 Heavy rocket.
Launch NROL-49 carried the payload into a 252 x 1023 km x 97.9 deg polar
orbit. Observations of its orbit are consistent with reports that it is
an Improved CRYSTAL type (KH-11 derivative) imaging reconnaissance
satellite; congratulations to Bob Christy for picking it up so quickly.

Afans'ev and Manarov continue in orbit aboard the
Mir/Kvant/Kvant-2/Kristall/Soyuz TM-11/Progress M-6 complex.  The
Progress M-6 cargo craft was launched on Jan 14 to resupply the station. 

Discovery will be moved to the VAB at the end of the month to be
mated to the external tank and solid boosters for mission STS-39,
an unclassified military mission due for launch in late Feb or
early Mar. Stacking of solid boosters for the GRO deployment mission
STS-37 has begun. 

The NATO IV-A comsat was launched by Delta 7925 from Canaveral on Jan 8
into geostationary orbit, to provide communications for NATO forces. 
Most NATO satellites are positioned over the Atlantic.  There were four
NATO III satellites launched between 1976 and 1984, and two smaller NATO
II satellites launched in 1970 and 1971.  These were preceded by the
Initial Defence Satellite Communications Program (IDCSP) of small
sub-synchronous satellites, which was a US system retrospectively
considered to have been the NATO I program. 

An Ariane 4 rocket launched two geostationary TV broadcasting satellites
on Jan 15, Italsat 1 from Italy and Eutelsat II F-2 for the European
Telecommunications Satellite Organization. 

Two Raduga comsats were launched in late December by Proton rockets from
Baykonur.  The first, on Dec 20, was the 26th standard Raduga TV relay
satellite.  The second, on Dec 27, was the second advanced Raduga-1
satellite, which first flew in 1989. Raduga ('Rainbow') is a C-band
satellite relaying TV and telephone communications in the Soviet Union.

Kosmos-2113, launched on Dec 21, is a new 7-tonne long duration digital
imaging recon satellite, replacing Kosmos-2072 which was deorbited on
Nov 21 after a 222-day mission.  It was launched from Baykonur on a
Soyuz booster, and is the most advanced Soviet spy satellite. 

Kosmos-2114, 2115, 2116, 2117, 2118, and 2119 are six small satellites
launched on a single three-stage Tsiklon launch vehicle from Plesetsk. 
They are probably military communication relays.  A couple of these
six-satellite launches occur each year, and appear to be replacing the
older octuplet system launched by the Kosmos R-14. 

Kosmos-2120, launched by Soyuz from Plesetsk on Dec 26 into a low 82
degree orbit, is probably a Vostok based recon satellite.  By mid
January it had undergone a number of large maneuvers to inspect
particular ground targets.

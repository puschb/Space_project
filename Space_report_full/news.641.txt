Shuttle and Station
--------------------

The Progress M-10M cargo supply ship  docked with the Station's Pirs
module at 1428 UTC on Apr 29. 

Space Shuttle OV-105 Endeavour was launched on mission STS-134 on May
16. It flew to orbit using solid rocket motors RSRM-113 and External
Tank ET-122. The RSRMs fell back to the Atlantic and were recovered,
after arcing into the mesosphere. ET-122, which had been repaired after
suffering significant damage in its New Orleans factory during Hurricane
Katrina, reached a 57 x 227 km marginal orbit; after apogee around 1336
UTC, it reentered at first perigee over the South Pacific at around 1405
UTC. Endeavour fired its OMS engines at apogee, entering a 231 x 324 km
x 51.6 deg orbit at 1336 UTC. After a series of rendezvous burns,
it is approaching the International Space Station for a docking
planned on May 18.

Endeavour will deliver a set of spare equipment to the Station on the
ELC-3 carrier, and install the massive AMS-02 particle detector which will
search for antimatter. The STORRM lidar is a test of rendezvous and
docking technology  to be used on the future Orion spaceship; MISSE
experiments are temporarily attached to the Station to study the effects
of exposing various materials to space. STP-H3 is a set of US Defense
Dept. experiments in the Space Test Program series, including
experimental thermal control systems and space environment sensors.

Crew of STS-134 are NASA's Mark Kelly, Greg H. Johnson, Mike Fincke,
Greg Chamitoff, Andrew Feustel, and the European Space Agency's Roberto
Vittori. Crew of the Space Station are Russian Space Agency astronauts
Dmitri Kondratev (commander), Andrey Borisenko, Aleksandr Samokutyaev,
NASA astronauts Cady Coleman and Ron Garan, and ESA astronaut Paolo Nespoli.
Nespoli and Vittori are both Italian, and Vittori is the first Italian astronaut
to make three flights. The first Italian astronaut was Franco Malerba, in
1992 (although 1960s American astronaut Michael Collins was born in Rome).


AEHF 1
------

During late March to late April, the US Air Force's AEHF 1
communications satellite raised its orbital period from 23 hours to 25
hours, passing briefly through the geosynchronous range. AEHF 1 was
launched in 2010 Aug to a supersynchronous transfer orbit of 249 x 50019
km x 22 deg; after failure of its main  propulsion system, electric
thrusters have been used to slowly raise the orbit to its current 22923
x 51539 km x 7.1 deg. Once the perigee has been raised to the 35780 km
or so needed for geostationary orbit, the apogee will be lowered to
match and the satellite will return to geosynchronicity.

Meridian
--------

The fourth Meridian communications satellite was launched on May 4
into a 978 x 39734 km x 62.8 deg orbit. The Meridian system provides
communications for the Russian Defense Ministry, and replaces
the older Molniya satellites.


Space-Based Infrared System
---------------------------

The US Air Force's SBIRS GEO-1 missile early warning satellite was
launched on May 7. This is the first dedicated satellite in the
Space-Based Infrared System, which will be the successor to the Defense
Support Program satellites in operation since 1970. In addition to
GEO-1, two National Reconnaissance Office satellites in highly
elliptical orbit, USA 184 and USA 200, carry the SBIRS HEO-1 and SBIRS
HEO-2 payloads in addition to their main NRO signals intelligence
payloads.

GEO-1 carries an infrared telescope with a large focal plane infrared
array to monitor large areas of the Earth at once. An internal movable
mirror is used to scan the field of view across the visible disk of the
Earth  looking for possible missile launches. This is in contrast to the
older spinning DSP satellites, whose telescopes were canted at an angle
to the spin axis so that the motion of the entire satellite swept the
field of view around. 23 DSP satellites were launched between 1970 and
2007.

GEO-1 was inserted into geostationary transfer orbit and will use its
own on board propulsion to circularize its orbit. The spacecraft is
based on the Lockheed Martin A2100 bus and uses a Leros-1 apogee
thruster from the UK company AMPAC (Thanks to Ted Molczan for pointing
out the Aviation Week story confirming the identity of the thruster.)

Suborbital launches
-------------------

The Chinese Space Science and Applications Research Center launched
its first Tianying-3C sounding rocket from Hainan Island on May 6.
The rocket carried experiments to study electron density
and electric fields in the ionosphere. Tianying-3C appears to be
a single-stage solid rocket roughly comparable to the Japanese S-310.

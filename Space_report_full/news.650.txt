Space Station
-------------

The Progress M-10M cargo ship undocked from the Pirs module at 0904 UTC
on Oct 29; the craft fired its deorbit engines at 1210 UTC and reentered
over the Pacific at 1248 UTC.

Progress M-13M was launched on Oct 30, reaching orbit at 1019 UTC to
sighs of relief from the ISS project. It successfully docked with the
Pirs module on Nov 2, with the result that the crew will have enough
supplies to avoid evacuating the Station. This is the first flight of
the old 11S510 model of the Soyuz upper stage and RD-0110 engine since
the Aug 24 failure of Progress M-12M. Two Soyuz 2-1B launches used the
14S54 third stage with an improved engine. The Progress M-13M flight is
ISS mission 45P and spacecraft production serial No. 413. It carries
the Chibis-M microsatellite which will be ejected after undocking.

Soyuz TMA-22 was launched on Nov 14 with commander Anton Shkaplerov and
flight engineers Anatoliy Ivanishin and Dan Burbank. It docked with the
Poisk module at 0524 UTC on Nov 16, and the astronauts joined the Soyuz
TMA-02M crew of Volkov, Fossum and Furukawa on board ISS.

NPP
---

The NPP weather satellite was launched from Vandenberg on Oct 28.
NPP is a nested acronym standing for NPOESS Preparatory Project,
where NPOESS was the National Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellite System,
a now-cancelled project that has been replaced by the Joint Polar Satellite
System. NPP will provide interim capability between the last of the
old NOAA Advanced TIROS-N polar weather satellites and the first JPSS
satellite to be launched in a few years.

The Delta 7920 launch vehicle carried six Cubesats in deployers attached
to its final stage. The first P-POD deployer carried three 1U Cubesats,
each 1 kg, 0.1m in size: AubieSat-1 from Auburn University, Alabama;
M-Cubed (the Michigan Multipurpose Mission) from the University of
Michigan; and E1PU2 (Explorer-1 Prime, Unit 2) from Montana State
University, which carries one of Van Allen's Geiger tubes. The second
deployer carred a 3U Cubesat, 0.1 x 0.3m, the RAX-2 Radio Aurora
Explorer, an NSF-funded mission also from the University of Michigan.
The final deployer carried two 1.5U cubesats, DICE-1 and DICE-2 from
Utah State University, which will study the magnetosphere and will each
deploy electric field antennas measuring 10 meters tip-to-tip.

Launch from Space Launch Complex 2-West at Vandenberg was at 0948 UTC;
Stage 2 reached a 195 x 853 km x 98.7 deg orbit at 0958 UTC. At 1040 UTC
a second burn circulazed the orbit at 816 x 819 km and the NPP satellite
separated at 1046 UTC. Stage 2's third burn at 1120 UTC lowered the
orbit and increased inclination, to 458 x 816 km x 101.7 deg (a higher
perigee than originally planned). At 1126 UTC the three 1U Cubesats were
ejected, followed at 1128 UTC by RAX-2 and at 1129 UTC by the pair of
DICE. A final burn at 1143 UTC lowered the Delta stage's orbit to 179 x
706 km x 107.3 deg to speed its eventual reentry. By Nov 8 NPP had
adjusted its orbit to 822 x 824 km x 98.7 deg.

Shenzhou 8
----------

The Shenzhou 8 spaceship was launched on Oct 31 on a mission to
rendezvous and dock with the Tiangong-1 spacelab. Shenzhou 8, like
Shenzhou 1 to 4, does not carry a crew. The first automated robotic
rendezvous and docking was carried out by the Soyuz No. 5 and No. 6
spaceships (Kosmos-186 and Kosmos-188) in 1967.

Shenzhou 8 was inserted into a 261 x 314 km x 42.8 deg orbit and
completed a rendezvous with Tiangong 1 on Nov 2, in a 328 x 338 km 
orbit. Docking was carried out successfully on Nov 2 at 1728 UTC. On Nov
14 at 1127 UTC it undocked, retreated to 140m and redocked at 1153 UTC.
On Nov 16 at 1030 UTC  Shenzhou 8 undocked from Tiangong 1 and prepared
to return to Earth.

Glonass-M
----------

Three Glonass-M (Uragan-M) navigation satellites were launched on Nov 4
from Baykonur aboard a Proton-M. The launch used a Briz-M upper stage.
This is the Block 44 Glonass launch, with satellites Uragan-M No. 743,
744 and 745, also known as Glonass-M No. 43, 44 and 45.  The satellites
will probably also get the cover names Kosmos-2475 to Kosmos-2477.
On Nov 12 the satellites were in orbits of 18907 x 19172 km x 64.8 deg,
19160 x 19319 km x 64.8 deg, and 19018 x 19178 km x 64.8 deg.


Fobos-Grunt
------------

The Fobos-Grunt probe took off at 2016 UTC on Nov 8 and reached a 206 x
341 km x 51.4 deg Earth parking orbit, but the solar orbit insertion
burns  did not take place. The probe separated from the Zenit-2SB41.1
rocket's second stage and remains in low earth orbit attached to its MDU
propulsion unit (similar to the Fregat stage). Attempts by ground
control to contact the vehicle have been unsuccessful, and the probe,
with an approximate mass of 13500 kg, is expected to reenter towards the
end of the year.

The Fobos-Grunt mission was intended to return a sample of the Martian
moon Phobos to Earth. The main spacecraft is attached to a Fregat-related
propulsion system consisting of the MDU main propulsion system (around
735 kg dry with 7015 kg of propellant) and the SBB drop tank (with a
further 3000 kg of propellant). The MDU was meant to make a first
burn to raise apogee to 4250 kg, release the drop tank, then make a second
burn to 17500 km and, some days later, a third to solar orbit insertion.
In August 2012 it would have also performed the Mars orbit insertion
burn. At this stage the MDU would have separated from the main spacecraft,
together with a truss structure and the 115 kg Chinese Yinghuo-1 
subsatellite; these three objects would have been left in a 900 x 77000 km
equatorial Mars orbit. The Fobos-Grunt PM (Pereletniy Modul', or cruise
module) would have made two major burns to enter a 9900 km circular
Mars orbit, completed a rendezvous with Phobos, and after some months
of close observation would have landed on its surface. A surface sample
would then have been transferred to the 7 kg SA (descent capsule)
which would have been launched to Mars orbit by the VA (vosvrashchaemiy
apparat, return module). The VA would have made the trans-Earth insertion
burn and controlled approach to Earth, separating shortly before the SA
performed entry and landing, which would have occurred in August 2014.

This was an extremely ambitious mission given the limited resources (and
underpaid scientists and engineers) of the IKI space science center and
the Lavochkin company which built the vehicle and managed the mission.
The last fully successful Russian interplanetary mission was Vega-2 in
1985-86, followed by a partial success by Fobos-2 in 1988-89. The
Fobos-1 and Mars-96 missions were failures. With this record, the
IKI/Lavochkin team, which have had a monopoly on Russian/Soviet
interplanetary exploration since IKI's formation in 1965, would have
been better advised to attempt a much more modest probe - in my opinion.
I hope the failure reviews lead to a robust and successful Russian deep
space program in the years to come. It's really good news that the
Spektr-R orbiting radiotelescope, developed by the same team, is now
making successful single-dish astronomical observations and preparing
for its initial interferometric experiments.


Yaogan 12
----------

The Yaogan Weixing 12 satellite was launched on Nov 9. The YW satellites
are Earth observing satellites, at least some of which probably have a
military role. The YW-12 launch also carried the small Tianxun-1
technology satellite. Tianxun-1 was built by the Nanjing University of
Aeronautics and Astronautics (Nanjing Hangkong Hangtian Daxue), carries
a small Earth observing CCD camera  and has a mass of 58 kg. The
satellites are in a 480 x 490 km x 97.4 deg orbit.


Kosmos-2472
-----------

The Kosmos-2472 imaging satellite landed on Oct 24. The Kobal't-M class
satellite fired its Ikar-class propulsion system to deorbit  around
2020-2030 UTC; the Yantar'-type descent module then separated, reentered
around 2037 UTC and landed at about 2048 UTC after a 119.2-day flight.

The spacecraft was launched into a 195 x 337 km x 81.5 deg orbit on Jun
27, moving to a 217 x 338 km x 81.4 deg orbit on Jun 29. From Jun 29 to
Aug 14 the spacecraft was kept between roughly 215-223 x 315-340 km with
orbit reboost burns on Jul 17 and Aug 1. Then the orbit was lowered to
210 x 245 km, and for the remainder of the mission was reboosted to 210
x 250 km each time apogee decayed to around 220 km. Boosts occurrent on
Aug 31, Sep 2, 13 and 23, Oct 1 and 12. The final orbit on Oct 24 was
200 x 242 km. The 81-degree orbit was previously used from the 1960s to
the 1990s for monitoring the breakup of Arctic ice, in particular  by
the Fram satellites (1975-1985). The satellite probably carried two
SpK small film recovery capsules which were jettisoned and deorbited
to a parachute landing sometime during the mission - unfortunately
the dates of these ejections can't be determined from the orbital data.

Dawn
----

The Dawn probe continues to operate in polar circumVestal orbit.
According to data on the Dawn web site and in Marc Rayman's journal,
orbit capture was at 0348 UTC on Jul 16 at about 16000 km from Vesta's
surface; ion engine thrusting was suspended from Jul 23 to Jul 29 in a
5200 km orbit, followed by descent to the  survey orbit of 2700 km
altitude which was reached on Aug 2. From Aug 31 to Sep 18 the orbit was
lowered again to 680 km for the high altitude mapping orbit (HAMO)
phase. On Nov 2 thrusting resumed to leave HAMO for the low altitude
mapping orbit which will be at 180 km; by Nov 16 altitude was 339 km. Of
course Vesta is far from spherical; altitudes are expressed relative to
a mean Vesta radius of 265 km.


Suborbital launches
--------------------

The Israeli Defense Force launched a ballistic missile on Nov 2
westward over the Mediterranean. This is probably the second test flight
of an improved missile which some western analysts dub the "Jericho III".
(Note that we don't know the true Israeli names of their ballistic missiles).
Russia launched a Bulava missile from a submarine in the White Sea
to the Kura range on Oct 28, and a Topol' missile from Plesetsk to Kura
on Nov 3.

The fifth flight of the Wisconsin/GSFC X-ray Quantum Calorimeter (XQC)
payload was launched on Nov 6, to observe the X-ray background and demonstrate
the detector technology.

India launched the long range Agni IV missile (previously known as Agni II Prime)
from Wheeler's Island near Balasore on Nov 15.

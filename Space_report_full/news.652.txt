No. 652                                        2012 Jan  8  Austin, Texas, USA
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Earth made its annual closest approach to the Sun at about 0030 UTC on Jan 5.
A happy perihelion to all my readers!

Space Station
-------------

Launch of the Soyuz TMA-03M spaceship from Baykonur with Oleg Kononenko,
Andre Kuipers and Don Pettit occurred on Dec 21. The ship docked
with the Rassvet module at 1519 UTC on Dec 23.

Meridian failure
-----------------

Launch of the fifth Meridian military communcations
satellite from Plesetk failed on Dec 23, once again putting the
Soyuz-2-1b launch vehicle in doubt. The Blok-I third stage
malfunctioned 7 min 1 s after launch, a couple of minutes short
of orbit insertion. Blok-I with the Fregat upper stage and the payload
crashed near Novosibirsk.

It has been reported that this was the first launch under the auspices
of the VVKO  (Voyska Vosdushno-Kosmicheskoi Oborona, Aerospace Defence
Forces), which on Dec 1 officially replaced the KVR (Russian Space
Forces), although Aleksandr Zheleznakyov (personal comm.) says that
the Nov 28 launch was actually the first for Voiska VKO. (The intermediate
launches were civilian ones performed by the Roskosmos).

GRAIL
-----

The GRAIL-A and GRAIL-B spacecraft entered lunar orbit on Dec 31 and Jan
1. The planned capture orbits were 88 x 8378 km x 87.2 deg for GRAIL-A,
and 111 x 8359 km x 88.3 deg for GRAIL-B. According to
spaceflightnow.com the actual orbit for GRAIL-A is 90 x 8362 km.
The GRAIL probes will now maneuver close to each other to begin their
gravity mapping mission.


Globalstar
-----------

Six Globalstar low orbit telecom satellites were launched on Dec 28 on a
Soyuz-2-1a from Plesetk. The successful launch by Roskosmos was a relief
coming only days after the Soyuz-2-1b failure, which may - perhaps -
be isolated to the RD-0124 engine that's unique to the 1b variant.
I don't yet have the serial numbers for the six satellites.


PSSC-2
------

The Aerospace Corporation's  PSSC Testbed 2 picosatellite, ejected from
mission STS-135, reentered on Dec 8. The 4 kg satellite carried four
tiny model-rocket motors to raise its orbit. One of those was fired on
Nov 4 at around 1530 UTC and raised the orbit slightly from 90.9 min,
317 x 319 km to 91.0 min, 316 x 329 km, delaying decay by about 4 days.
Based on the otherwise steady orbital decay rate, it appears that the
remaining motors were not fired.

ZY-1 02C
--------

China launched the Ziyuan yihao 02C satellite from Taiyuan on Dec 22.
The satellite carries imaging cameras with a resolution of 2.4m.
The two earlier ZY-1 satellites were launched as part of a joint
Sino-Brazilian program (CBERS), but this one appears to be all-Chinese.
China also has a ZY-2 series, thought to be used for defense related
imaging, while ZY-1 is used for civilian mapping and resource monitoring.

Tiangong and X-37
-----------------

The USAF's X-37B OTV spaceplane launched in Mar 2011 remains in orbit.
However, contrary to some recent media reports, its mission is unrelated
to observations of the Tiangong-1 spacelab; the orbital planes of
the two vehicles are perpendicular.


Erratum
-------

Of course, Cassini's been in Saturn orbit since 2004 Jul 1, not 2005 - that
should teach me not to send out JSR at 3am in future.


Suborbital flights
------------------

On Dec 23 the Russian Navy carried out a launch of two Bulava missiles
from the submarine Yuriy Dolgorukiy, according to Pavel Podvig's
site russianforces.org. Each missile carried
several (probably six) reentry vehicles which flew from the White Sea to
the Kura test range in Kamchatka.
On Dec 27, a UR-100NU rocket was launched from Baykonur to Kura
carrying an experimental reentry vehicle.

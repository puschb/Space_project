Space Station
-------------

Expedition 30 continues with Soyuz TMA-22 docked at Poisk and Soyuz
TMA-03M docked to the Rassvet module. ATV 3 is docked at Zvezda. Ex-30
commander is Dan Burbank; flight engineers 1 to 5 are Anton Shkaplerov,
Anatoliy Ivanishin, Oleg Kononenko, Andre Kuipers, and Don Pettit. The
Progress M-14M cargo ship undocked from the Pirs module at 1104 UTC on
Apr 19 to begin nine days of Radar-Progress ionospheric experiments.

Meanwhile, Orbiter OV-103 Discovery was ferried from Kennedy Space Center
to Dulles airport by the NASA SCA 905 airplane on Apr 18, and then towed to the
Smithsonian's nearby Udvar-Hazy complex for display on Apr 19.


North Korean launch
-------------------

Launch of the Unha-3 rocket with the Kwangmyongsong-3 satellite payload
from the Sohae launch site at Tongch'ang-dong occurred on Apr 12.

Based on the available information announced by the South Korean
military, it seems that the rocket took off at 2238:55 UTC but failed
near the end of first stage burn, probably at the point of separation of
the first and second stages about 1min30s after launch at 2240 UTC. The
remains of it then  arced up 151 km into space and fell back into the
Yellow Sea at about 124E 36N (according to South Korean statements) 
probably about 5 minutes after launch. This is consistent with a
trajectory of roughly -6200 x 130 km x 88 deg, about what one might
expect for the first stage. The impact area is close to the  planned
impact zone for the first stage which was at 124.5-124.8E, 35.2-35.9N.  

However, NORAD says the impact was 165 km west of Seoul, which is  well
north of this and well off the planned launch track. This is a
surprising claim and I am wondering if they meant something slightly
different - e.g. 165 km W of Seoul's Incheon airport, which would put
the impact near 124.5W 37.5N, on the expected track. More likely, they
originally meant "very roughly 100 miles west" and the conversion got
corrupted. In any case this is a bit north of the expected first stage
impact zone, which could indicate a failure prior to first stage cutoff,
or  underperformance by the first stage engines, if correct. At this
point I place more reliance on the South Korean data and suspect that
the NORAD data is highly approximate at best. Washington Post's
correspondent Chico Harlan reported North Korea's admission that the
satellite failed to enter orbit.

From KCNA: "The DPRK launched its first application satellite
Kwangmyongsong-3 at the Sohae Satellite Launching Station in Choisan
County, North Phyongan Province at 07:38:55am on Friday. The earth
observation satellite failed to enter its preset orbit. Scientists,
technicians and experts are now looking into the cause of the failure".
This contrasts with the two previous failures which the North Koreans
still claim as successes.


Suborbital launches
--------------------

India carried out the first test launch of its three-stage Agni V
missile on Apr 19. The missile, which has a claimed range of 5000 km,
flew from Wheeler Island in Orissa to the southern Indian Ocean
near 90E 20S; an orbit of -4700 x 800 km x 81 deg very roughly
matches the data.

An unidentified tactical ballistic missile was launched from
White Sands (or possibly Fort Wingate) on Mar 29 as a target
for Patriot interceptors.

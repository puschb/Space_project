International Space Station
----------------------------

On the ISS, Expedition 31, with commander Oleg Kononeko, and
astronauts FE-1 Gennadiy Padalka, FE-2 Sergey Revin, FE-3 Joe Acaba,
FE-5 Andre Kuipers and  FE-6 Don Pettit, continued until Jun 30.
On Jul 1 at 0448 UTC Soyuz TMA-03M undocked from Rassvet under the command
of Kononenko, with Expedition 32 beginning on ISS under the command of Padalka.

Kononenko, Kuipers and Pettit returned to Earth aboard TMA-03M on Jul 1.
The deorbit burn at 0719 UTC lowered the Soyuz's perigee into the
atmosphere The orbital module and service module (BO and PAO) separated
from the descent module (SA) at 0747 UTC. All three objects reentered
beginning at around 0751 UTC, with the BO and PAO burning up and the
heat-shielded SA carrying the crew touching down in Kazakhstan at 0814:48 UTC.

Padalka, Revin and Acaba are expected to be joined by Sunita Williams,
Yuriy Malenchenko and Akido Hoshide aboard Soyuz TMA-05M later this month.

Shenzhou and Tiangong
----------------------

The Shenzhou-9 crew undocked from Tiangong 1 at 0309 UTC on Jun 24 and
backed off to 300 m, then reapproached first to 140m and then to a
manually controlled redocking carried out by Liu Wang at 0449 UTC.
(These times are based on the live TV reports; the post-landing press
conference gave slightly later times.) On Jun 28 at 0122 UTC Shenhzhou 9
undocked again for the last time; a brief manual re-rendezvous to 140m
was carried out, possibly around 0300 UTC? Return to Earth came on Jun
29 with orbital module sep at about 0116 UTC, retrofire at 0117 UTC,
service module sep at 0138 UTC and landing at 0202 UTC in Siziwangqi,
a district in Ulanqab prefecture in Inner Mongolia. Bob Christy has a nice summary of the
reentry at http://www.zarya.info/Diaries/China/Shenzhou/9/Shenzhou9Landing.php

The Shenzhou 9 orbital module ('guidao cang') was jettisoned into a 333 x 354 km
orbit, but has not yet been tracked by the US.

NuSTAR
------

The NuSTAR hard X-ray observatory extended its ten-meter mast on Jun 21
from 1743 to 1809 UTC,  a critical mission event which places its twin
optics modules at the correct distance from the focal plane detectors.
It was reported on Jun 28 that the first light observation of Cyg X-1 
was successful and shows a good image.

NROL-38
-------

On Jun 20 a Lockheed Martin Atlas V 401, serial AV-023, was launched
from Cape Canaveral on the NROL-38 mission for the National
Reconnaissance Office. Analysts expect that the payload is a Satellite
Data System communications and data relay satellite to be placed in
geostationary orbit. The payload will probably be given the cover name
USA 236. The Centaur stage is believed to have been deorbited after completing
one elliptical revolution.

NROL-15
-------

On Jun 29 the NROL-15 mission was launched on a Delta 4 Heavy, the first to use
uprated RS-68A engines instead of the usual RS-68. The new engines were developed
especially for the NROL-15 payload, which is therefore assumed to be unusually
heavy. Evidence suggests a launch to geostationary orbit; the mission is likely to
be a geostationary signals intelligence satellite. It is unclear whether the extra
performance needed reflects an evolutionary (`block') change in the existing series
of payloads (referred to as Advanced ORION by outside observers) or indicates
an entirely new system of some kind, either as a successor or as a parallel system
with a different mission. In my satellite tables I will assume for the sake
of definiteness that it is a block change, and denote it `Heavy ORION' for the time being. 
The Delta 4's 5-meter second stage is also believed to be in near-geosynchronous orbit.

 Following on from the list in JSR 605:

Probable satellites in the RHYOLITE lineage
  --------------------------------------------
For the satellites launched after 1990, no codename has been leaked. (The codename, of
course, changes each time it is leaked).
The 'Block' is a name made up by me to indicate suspected changes in satellite design.

X-37B
-----

The US Air Force's X-37B flight vehicle 2, which had been in orbit since
March 2011, landed on the runway at Vandenberg Air Force Base at 1248
UTC on June 16. The spacecraft had been in a 330 x 340 km x 42.8 deg
orbit until a series of burns lowered it to 280 km during late May;
hobbyist observers last saw it on May 31. The circa-5000-kg robot
spaceplane, launched on an Atlas V, carried a secret payload. Flight
vehicle 1, which flew in orbit from Apr-Dec 2010, is being prepared for
its second spaceflight. The X-37B project is managed by the USAF's Rapid
Capabilities Office in Washington; the vehicle was developed by Air
Force Research Laboratory offices AFRL/RV at Kirtland AFB, New Mexico
and AFRL/RB (Air Vehicles) at Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio, with Boeing
Phantom Works. This sets it apart from other USAF space projects which
are mostly managed out of Los Angeles, and indicates a closer connection
with the `air' side of the Air Force.

Suborbital launches
--------------------

Sounding rocket NASA 36.286 was launched from White Sands on Jun 23
carrying a payload to calibrate the SDO-EVE experiment on the Solar
Dynamics Observatory satellite. Principal investigator is Tom Woods of
U. Colorado. The rocket measured the spectrum and brightness of the Sun
in the EUV and soft X-ray bands. Meanwhile, Jonathan Cirtain of
NASA-Marshall is preparing two more solar rockets, NASA 36.284NS (SUMI)
and NASA 36.272NS (Hi-C), for launch at White Sands in the coming weeks.
Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory was also involved in building the
Hi-C payload and SAO scientist Kelly Korreck is in New Mexico for the
launch. Good luck Jonathan and Kelly!

Germany's SHEFEX-II hypersonics experiment was launched on Jun 22
from Andoya in Norway. The two-stage Brazilian VS-40 rocket, with
S-40 and S-44 motors, launched the reentry vehicle northwards into
the Arctic.

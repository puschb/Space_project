----------------------------------------------------

Launch of STS-37/Atlantis and the Gamma Ray Observatory
remains due for early April.

Viktor Afanas'ev and Musa Manarov continue in orbit aboard the
Mir/Kvant/Kvant-2/Kristall/Soyuz TM-11/Progress M-6 complex.  

An Ariane 4 rocket successfully orbited two satellites on Mar 2.
Astra 1B is a TV broadcasting satellite owned by the Luxembourg
based company SES (Societe Europeene des Satellites). 
MOP (Meteosat Operational Programme) 2 is a European geostationary
weather satellite and will probably be renamed Meteosat 5 now
that it is in orbit. It is operated by ESA for the EUMETSAT 
(European Meteorological Satellite Organization). The Arianespace SA
Ariane rocket is launched from the ESA base at Kourou in Guyane;
the third stage enters an elliptical geostationary transfer orbit
(GTO) with a perigee of a few hundred km and an apogee of 36000 km.
The two satellites separate from the third stage, and then once
at apogee ignite their internal rocket motors (a European MAGE rocket
for Meteosat, and probably a Thiokol Star 30 for Astra), putting
them in approximately circular equatorial 24 hour orbits. Small 
thrusters are used to put the satellites in near exact stationary
orbits once they have drifted to the right longitude.

The 27th Raduga geostationary communications satellite
was launched on Feb 28 by 4-stage Proton from Baykonur.
Raduga is a C-band comsat for relay of telephone and TV
transmissions, first launched in 1975 for the Soviet
Ministry of Communications.

A Delta II 6925 launch vehicle placed the INMARSAT II F-2
satellite in geostationary transfer orbit on Mar 10.
INMARSAT is the International Maritime Satellite Organization.
The INMARSAT satellites provide L-band mobile communications
links for ships, aircraft and vehicles. The first INMARSAT II
was launched last year. There were no INMARSAT I satellites;
previously INMARSAT leased the MARECS satellites from ESA,
the MARISAT satellites from Comsat General Corp., and the
MCS transponders on the INTELSAT VA satellites.

10 years ago:  12 Mar 1981  Vladimir Kovalyonok and Viktor Savinykh
reached orbit in Soyuz T-4. They were the last long stay crew aboard
the Salyut 6 space station, remaining there for two and a half months.

20 years ago:  3 Mar 1971  The second Chinese satellite, Shi Jian,
was launched by a Chang Zheng 1 rocket. Its transmitter operated
for 8 years.

30 years ago: 9 Mar 1961. Korabl'-Sputnik-4 was launched by Vostok rocket
from Baykonur on one of the final unpiloted test flights of the Vostok
spaceship. The cabin, containing guinea pigs, mice, insects, and a 
dog called Chernushka, was recovered after one orbit.

International Space Station
----------------------------

Expedition 34 continued during early March with commander Kevin Ford and
flight engineers FE-1 Oleg Novitskiy, FE-2 Yevgeniy Tarelkin, FE-4 Roman
Romanenko, FE-5 Chris Hadfield, and FE-6 Tom Marshburn. Ferry ship Soyuz
TMA-06M was docked at the Poisk module; Soyuz TMA-07M is at Rassvet;
cargo ship Progress M-17M is at the Zvezda aft port and Progress M-18M
is at the Pirs module. Dragon CRS-2 is at the nadir Harmony port.

SpaceX recovered nominal operation of Dragon CRS-2 following the
thruster initialization anomaly that happened on orbit insertion. Dragon
made a further orbit change, possibly at around 0540 UTC, on Mar 2,
moving from a 391 x 405 km orbit to a 332 x 507 km orbit, apogee now
well above the ISS in its 401 x 417 km orbit. Another burn at circa 1100
UTC adjusted the orbit to 430 x 447 km and was followed by burns on Mar
3 to complete the rendezvous.

Dragon arrived 350m from the Station at 0840 UTC on Mar 3 and approached
along the R-bar (ISS-Earth vector) to a distance of 10m. It was captured
by the SSRMS at 1031 UTC and bolted to the nadir CBM port of the Harmony
module by 1356 UTC.

On Mar 6 the station SSRMS arm unloaded the HRS Grapple Fixture package
from the Dragon trunk and berthed it on the Mobile Base System.
Meanwhile, the crew unloaded all the cargo in the pressurized section.
Dragon return to Earth is scheduled for Mar 25.

On Mar 13 the Station crew held a change-of-command ceremony as Chris
Hadfield became Commander. Expedition 35 formally began, with Hadfield,
Romanenko and Marshburn, when Soyuz TMA-06M undocked at 2343 UTC on Mar
15 carrying Ford, Tarelkin and Novitskiy.

At 0213 UTC on Mar 16 Soyuz TMA-06M fired its engines to lower orbit
from 399 x 417 km x 51.6 deg to about -25 x 407 km. It reentered the
atmosphere at 0242 UTC and landed in Kazakhstan at about 0306 UTC Mar
16. As of Mar 20 I have not seen a definitive landing time.


SBIRS GEO-2
------------

The second geostationary satellite in the Space-Based Infrared System
was launched into geostationary transfer orbit on Mar 19 on Atlas V
flight AV-037.  The SBIRS GEO satellites are built by Lockheed Martin
and probably have a mass of around 4500 kg. SBIRS carries two infrared telescopes,
one with a staring sensor and one scanning. The SBIRS system also includes
secondary payloads on NRO elliptical orbit (HEO) satellites.

Parking orbit of about 174 x 1060 km x 26.7 deg was reached at 2136 UTC;
GTO of 182 x 35804 km x 22.2 deg at 2149 UTC; and the Centaur separated
at 2204 UTC to let SBIRS begin its independent climb to GEO altitude.

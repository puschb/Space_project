Jonathan's Space Report
No. 683                                                     2013 Jul 30, Somerville, MA

International Space Station
----------------------------

Expedition 36 is continuing. The crew are commander Pavel Vinogradov, 
Flight Engineers FE-2 Alexandr Misurkin, FE-3 Chris Cassidy, FE-4
Yurchikin, FE-5 Parmitano and FE-6 Nyberg. Ferry ship Soyuz TMA-08M is
at Poisk and TMA-09M at Rassvet. Cargo ship ATV-4 is at the Zvezda module
and Progress M-20M is at the Pirs module.

Progress M-18M undocked from the Pirs module at 2053 UTC on Jul 25 and
was deorbited over the South Pacific 3 hours later, with debris ocean
impact around 0042 UTC Jul 26. Progress M-20M was launched from Baykonur
on Jul 27 at 2045 UTC into a 189 x 218 km x 51.6 deg orbit and carried
out a series of maneuvers to reach the ISS orbit of 413 x 419 km and
dock with the Pirs module 5hr 41min after launch. Unusually, the US did
not release any orbital data for Progress M-20M during its flight to the
ISS.

IRNSS-1A
---------

India's navigation satellite is now in inclined geostationary orbit at
35702 x 35870 km x 27.0 deg, orbiting over the 52 to 58 deg E range.

IRIS
----

NASA's IRIS ultraviolet solar observatory opened its telescope door on
Jul 17, and has taken its first images of the solar transition region.

MUOS 2
------

The second Mobile User Objective System satellite was launched on Jul 19
into geostationary transfer orbit (possibly around 3800 x 35786 km x
19.1 deg according to estimates by Ted Molczan). MUOS 2 provides UHF
communications links for the US Navy. The satellite is built by Lockheed
Martin and has a mass of around 6700 kg full 3800 kg dry. It probably
reached geostationary orbit in late July.


Chinese triple launch
---------------------

A CZ-4C rocket launched on Jul 19 placed three experimental satellites 
in a 666 x 673 km x 98.1 deg sun-synchronous orbit with an 06:42 local
time descending node. The SJ-15 satellite is thought to be carrying out
observations of space debris, while SY-7 is testing a robotic arm.
debris. The CX-3 small satellite is thought to have been built by the
Chinese Academy of Sciences and may be carrying technology experiments
and/or serve as a target for the robotic arm tests.

Ariane launch
--------------

Ariane vehicle 569, on flight VA214, placed the Alphasat and Insat 3D
satellites in a 224 x 35827 km x 3.5 deg geostationary transfer orbit on
Jul 25. Alphasat is a major joint project between the European Space
Agency and the maritime satellite operator Inmarsat. The new Alphabus
class spacecraft is intended to demonstrate advanced technologies for
ESA, including a laser communications system and radio communications
links in Q and V band, while carrying a useful `extended L-band' payload
to add to Inmarsat's satellite broadband capacity. The Alphabus propulsion system
features what I believe is the first flight of the new Astrium/Lampoldshausen
500N EAM (European Apogee Motor), a MON/MMH system with an Isp of about 325s.
Alphasat has a launch mass of 6650 kg; dry mass is probably around 3500 kg.
By Jul 30 Alphasat was in a 25608 x 35809 km x 0.3 deg orbit.

Insat 3D carries a meteorological payload for the Indian Space Research
Organization. In addition to a 6-channel imager and a 19-channel
sounder, the satellite has a data relay system for Earth-based meteo
stations and a Satellite Aided Search and Rescue transponder. Insat 3D
is 2090 kg full, 935 kg dry. On Jul 27 Insat 3D raised its orbit to
15780 x 35800 km x 0.7 deg, and on Jul 28 it reached 31800 x 35795 km x
0.02 deg,  although US tracking seems to have missed these orbit
manuevers.


Delta 114 reentry
------------------

Delta 114 reentered over Africa on Jul 14, with debris landing near the
Zimplats platinum mine (about 18.7S 30.4E) in the Mhondoro district of
Zimbabwe south of Harare.

Delta 114 was a Model 2914 Delta launch vehicle launched
from Cape Canaveral on 1975 Aug 27, and placed the French-German
Symphonie 2 satellite in orbit. The second stage made two burns
to a 410 x 2020 km x 25.3 deg orbit; the third stage then 
fired to get to geostationary transfer orbit. By April this year,
the Delta 114 second stage orbit had decayed to a nearly-circular
300 x 410 km and rapid decay set in, with the last orbit data on
Jul 13 showing 174 x 185 km x 25.3 deg. SpaceTrack's TIP decay notice
gives a reentry time of Jul 14 0600 UTC +/- 2 min, over the Gulf of Guinea.
Extrapolating the final ground track shows that reentering debris
would have passed over central Zimbabwe at around 0612 UTC.
Reports from Zimbabwe indicate multiple high altitude sonic booms heard
on Jul 14, with photographs of what appears to be a dented second stage
propellant tank found on the ground.


Erratum - the leaky spacesuit
------------------------------

EMU 3011, which leaked water into Luca Parmitano's helmet during the
recent spacewalk, had three previous station tours, not two. Here is its flight history:
  Flight 1  STS-79     1996 Sep 16-1996 Sep 25  (Apt, not used)
  Flight 2  STS-83     1997 Apr  4-1997 Apr  8  (Spacelab, Gernhardt, not used)

  Flight 14 STS-132    2010 May 14-present     (ISS tour; Williams (1), Hoshide (2), Parmitano(2))

EMU 3011 incorporates the PLSS 1011 backpack - this contains most of the systems
and you can think of it as the core of the suit considered as its own spaceship, 
with the other components as a relatively inert bubble containing the human occupant.
Before the EMU 3000 series nomenclature was adopted, PLSS 1011 flew multiple times:

  Flight  1 STS 61-B   1985 Nov 27-1985 Dec  3  EMU 1070/PLSS 1011 (Spring, 1 EVA)
  Flight  2 STS-26R    1988 Sep 29-1988 Oct  3  EMU 1090/PLSS 1011 (Lounge, not used)
  Flight  3 STS-27R    1988 Dec  2-1988 Dec  6  EMU 1090/PLSS 1011 (Ross, not used)
  Flight  4 STS-29R    1989 Mar 13-1989 Mar 18  EMU 1090/PLSS 1011 (Springer, not used)
  Flight  5 STS-28R    1989 Aug  8-1989 Aug 13  EMU 1098/PLSS 1011 (Brown, not used)
  Flight  6 STS-36     1990 Feb 28-1990 Mar  4  EMU 2008/PLSS 1011 (Thout, not used)
  Flight  7 STS-41     1990 Oct  6-1990 Oct 10  EMU 2008/PLSS 1011 (Akers, not used)
  Flight  8 STS-39     1991 Apr 28-1991 May  6  EMU 2008/PLSS 1011 (Harbaugh, not used)
  Flight  9 STS-48     1991 Sep 12-1991 Sep 18  EMU 2008/PLSS 1011 (Buchli, not used)
  Flight 10 STS-46     1992 Jul 31-1992 Aug  8  EMU 2021/PLSS 1011 (Chang, not used)
  Flight 11 STS-73     1995 Oct 20-1995 Nov  5  EMU 2034/PLSS 1011 (Coleman, not used)

So, this PLSS has flown a total of 25 times in space over 28 years -
although of course there's a bit of a "grandfather's axe" paradox
involved as it's not clear how many of the original components remain.

Suborbital launches
-------------------

JAXA launched two sounding rockets on Jul 20 to study medium-scale travelling
ionospheric disturbances. S-310-42 released a TMA package (trimethyl-aluminium)
to study E-region neutral winds, while S-520-27 carried out measurements
of density and electric field, and released lithium to study 
F-region neutral winds.

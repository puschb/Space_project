Chang'e-3
---------

Chang'e-3 was in lunar polar orbit from Dec 6 to Dec 14.  On Dec 10 at
1320 UTC the orbit was lowered from 100 x 100 to 15 x 100 km. At 1259:52
UTC Dec 14, near perilune, the descent engine was turned on to
decelerate the probe and fly it down to the surface. Chang'e-3 touched
down at 1311:18 UTC Dec 14, at 19.51W 44.12N, about 43 km south of
crater Laplace F in the Mare Imbrium. This was the first lunar soft
landing since the USSR's Luna-24 in 1976.

Note: The original planned landing site was in Sinus Iridum (Bay of Rainbows) but
the Chinese decided to land one orbit early, with the probe flying a little
further east over Mare Imbrium (Sea of Rains). Unfortunately many of the media
reports appear to have missed that memo...

At 2035 UTC on Dec 14 the `Yutu hao' (`rabbit') rover drove down the
Chang'e-3 ramp onto the lunar surface. Yutu and Chang'e-3 are both solar
powered, but also carry small Pu-238 radioactive heater units to keep
systems from freezing during the 14-day lunar night (see Dwayne Day's
article at http://www.thespacereview.com/article/2401/1). Yutu has six
wheels and a mass of around 140 kg.

The CZ-3B third stage rocket was launched to a 311 x 352280 km x 29.6
deg orbit which passed close to the Moon at around 1100 UTC on Dec 6
and, according to tracking by astronomers, is currently in a 106000 x
662000 km x 35.8 deg orbit around the Earth-Moon system. See Bill Gray's
page at http://www.projectpluto.com/pluto/mpecs/che3.htm for details.

International Space Station
----------------------------

Expedition 38 continues with commander Oleg Kotov, and flight engineers
FE-2 Sergey Ryazanskiy, FE-3 Michael Hopkins, FE-4 Mikhail Tyurin, FE-5
Rick Mastracchio and FE-6 Koichi Wakata. Ferry ship Soyuz TMA-10M is at
Poisk and TMA-11M is at Rassvet.  Cargo ship Progress M-20M is at the
Pirs module and Progress M-21M is at the Zvezda module.

A problem developed on Dec 11 with the Pump Module on ETCS Loop A,  one
of the Station's two cooling loops. With only loop B operating,  various
ISS systems had to be shut down to reduce the amount of heat being
generated. It seems likely - but not yet certain - that a series of
spacewalks will be needed to replace the module. 

The newly failed Pump Module is serial number S/N 04 (PM-1), which was
launched on STS-121 in 2006 and stored on External Stowage Platform 2
until Aug 2010, when it was  installed in the S1 truss to replace
another Pump Module, S/N 02, which had failed after 8 years in space.
The P1 truss hosts the Loop B PM (unknown serial number) which has been
operating since 2002. There are three spares on ISS:

         PM S/N 02      (Loop A)  - Launched 2002, failed 2010, returned to Earth 2011
         PM S/N Unknown (Loop B)  - Launched 2002, active
         PM S/N 04      (Spare 1) - Launched 2006, in use 2010, failed on S1 truss 2013
         PM S/N Unknown (Spare 2) - Launched 2009, stored on ESP-3
         PM S/N 07      (Spare 3) - Launched 2009, stored on ELC-2
         PM S/N 05      (Spare 4) - Launched 2009, stored on ELC-1

 The pump modules have a mass of 354 kg. (If you can fill in the gaps 
 in the serial numbers, please contact me at planet4589@gmail.com)
 

SES-8
-----

SpaceX carried out its first geostationary transfer launch on Dec 3.
Payload was the SES-8 satellite, a 3100-kg Orbital Star-2.4 for SES
World Skies. The second flight of the uprated Falcon 9 v1.1, and its
first from Cape Canaveral, appears to have been a complete success.
After reaching parking orbit the second stage reignited at 2308 UTC and
placed SES-8 in a 423 x 79977 km x 20.47 deg supersynchronous transfer
orbit. SpaceX does not appear to have released the parameters of the
parking orbit but it appears to have been around 300 x 400 km x 28.5
deg. [Note: this analysis is based on the tracking data which was 
probably taken at high altitudes, so the perigee estimate may be
inaccurate]. Around 1545 UTC on Dec 5 SES-8 reached first apogee and raised
its orbit to 14401 x 80416 km x 6.2 deg, and then the next day to
35823 x 79932 km x 1.2 deg. Apogee was then lowered on Dec 11 and the
orbit is now 35681 x 45299 km x 0.5 deg, with a further apogee lowering
burn needed to reach GEO once the spacecraft is in the right spot.

Inmarsat 5F1
------------

Inmarsat PLC's first Inmarsat 5 satellite, carrying the Ka-band Global XPress 
communications payload, was launched from Baykonur on Dec 8.
The Inmarsat 5 satellites, with 6090 kg launch mass, are BSS-702HP models
built by Boeing/El Segundo.

The Proton reached a -495 x 170 km orbit and the first Briz burn put
the stack in a 173 x 173 km parking orbit. Further burns
delivered I5-F1 to a 4306 x 64809 km x 26.7 deg supersynchronous transfer orbit
via intermediate orbits of 295 x 6000 km, 360 x 14847 km, and 475 x 65044 km.
The Briz-M stage and drop tank are being tracked, but there seems to be 
no orbital data yet for the payload.

CBERS 3
-------

A new China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite was launched on Dec 9.
Zi Yuan 1 No. 3 was launched from Taiyuan Space Center.

Brazilian sources initially reported the launch was a success, but
it now appears that the CZ-4B rocket failed to reach orbit. A news
story on globo.com cited in nasaspaceflight.com reports that stage
3 cutoff was 11 seconds too early. I estimate an approximate
orbit of around -150 x 720 km x 98.5 deg, with impact in
the Antarctic around 0407 UTC; however, the uncertainties are
large and this estimate could be way off.


Suborbital launches
-------------------

On Dec 14 the Iranian Space Agency launched a Shahab-1 liquid propellant
missile from the Imam Khomeini Space Center in Semnan province on a 120
km suborbital flight, carrying a 3 kg, 3 year old rhesus monkey (Macaca
mulatta)  named Fargam. This was the fourth Iranian monkey in space, and
the second to return successfully following the Kavoshgar Pisgham
('Pioneer Probe') mission in January. The use of a liquid fuel missile
provides gentler acceleration than the small solid propellant sounding rockets
used for earlier experiments. 

The Kavoshgar Pazhuhesh ('Research Probe') flight was the first 'Class
D' mission of the  Kavoshgar series. The payload was developed by the
Institute of Astronautical Systems, which I believe is part of the
Aerospace Research Institute in Tehran. A new web site,
kavoshgar.ari.ac.ir, gives new details of this and earlier flights; I
summarize the program below. The M5 rocket used for the first flight is
a small vehicle, possibly similar to the Nazeat class sounding rocket
used for flights 2 and 3.

    2011 Sep  7   Kavoshgar 5           Fateh? K110   120       Capsule C/Monkey, crashed on recovery
    2012 Sep  8   Kavoshgar 6           Fateh? K110   120       Capsule C/Monkey, crashed on recovery
    2013 Jan 28   Kavoshgar Pishgam     Fateh? K110   120       Capsule C/Monkey, successful
    2013 Dec 14   Kavoshgar Pazhuhesh   Shahab-1      120       Capsule D/Monkey, successful
   
The Shahab-1 was based on the Soviet R-11 and was originally used in
1985 in Iranian missile attacks on Iraq during those two countries' long
war; it is several generations behind the latest Iranian military
missiles, the liquid fuel Shahab-3 and Ghadr missiles based on the North
Korean Nodong, and the domestically developed solid fuel Sejjil-2.
Roughly speaking, one prefers solid fuel in ballistic missiles for
storability and rapid launch, but liquid fuel in human spaceflight
launchers for gentler acceleration and more controllable abort modes, so
it makes sense for retired large liquid fuel missiles to be transferred
to the research program as Iran masters the larger solids for military
use - just as liquid fuel Atlas and Thor missiles were recycled as space
launch vehicles when the solid fuel Minuteman took over the bulk of ICBM
duties.

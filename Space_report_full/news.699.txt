International Space Station
---------------------------

Expedition 40 is continuing with ISS in a 412 x 420 km x 51.7 deg orbit.

On Jul 13 the third Orbital Sciences Cygnus cargo ship, SS Janice Voss,
was launched from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport at Wallops Island
on an Antares 120 rocket. The 5000 kg Voss carries supplies for the ISS, as well
as two Nanoracks bags containing a total of 29 3U cubesats - 1
Techedsat-4 exobrake technology test for NASA-Ames and San Jose State U,
and 28 Flock-1b imaging satellites for PlanetLabs. They are intended to be deployed
from the Kibo airlock over the coming months. The Voss is scheduled to arrive
at the ISS on Jul 16.


Dnepr cluster
-------------

On Jun 19, launch of a Dnepr rocket from the Yasniy missile base put a record 38 payloads
in sun-synchronous orbits ranging from 550 to 610 km at perigee and 620 to 715 km at apogee.

The largest payload, Deimos-2, is a 300 kg Earth imaging satellite with 0.75m resolution
from Elecnor Deimos of Spain. It is in a 597 x 618 km x 98 deg orbit.

Hodoyoshi-3 and Hodoyoshi-4 are 60 kg payloads built by AXELSPACE for the University of Tokyo.
H-3 carries a 40-m resolution camera, a store-forward comm payload 
and a hydrogen peroxide propulsion system. H-4 carries a 5-m res Earth imaging camera, a comm
payload and an ion thruster.

Kazeosat-2 is a Surrey Satellite SSTL-150 Earth imaging satellite with a 6.5km resolution
for Kazakhstan.

Saudisat-4 is a 100 kg satellite from KACST, Saudi Arabia, with a technology payload
including a graviational reference sensor (similar to the San Marco/TRIAD systems of the 1970s,
I believe, with an isolated mass allowing drag effects to be isolated).

TabletSat-Aurora is a 25 kg tech demo satellite from the Sputniks (Satellite Innovation Space
Systems) company in Moscow.

Tita (BugSat-1) is a technology demo of Satellogic SA (Argentina)'s 22 kg Earth observation
satellite. Resolution of the imager is not known.

AprizeSat-9 and 10 are technology development satellites for SpaceQuest, with AIS maritime
location payloads.

Perseus-M1 and Perseus-M2 are 6U cubesats carrying AIS maritime location payloads
built by Canopus Systems, a California subsidiary of Russia's Dauria Aerospace.

POPSAT-HIP1 is a 3U cubesat from Microspace Rapid in Singapore.

QB50P1 and QB50P2 are 2U scientific satellites forming part of the European QB50 consortium project
coordinated by the Von Karman Institute near Brussels and built by ISIS BV in Delft.

PACE is a 2U cubesat from National Chen Kung University in Tainan, Taiwan, with an attitude
control experiment.

DTUSAT-2 is payload for relaying data from transmitters attached to migrating birds. The
1U cubesat is from DTU in Copenhagen.

DUCHIFAT-1 is a 1U cubesat from Herzilya Science Center, Israel, with a position reporting relay
payload.

NanoSatC-BR-1 is a 1U cubesat from INPE's Southern Center and UFSM, in Santa Maria, Brazil.

PolyITAN 1 is a 1U cubesat from Kiev Polytechnic Institute.

Unisat-6, from the Gauss Team in Rome, is a small satellite for dispensing other satellites.
It ejected Tigrisat, Lemur, ANTELSAT and Aerocube.

Tigris is a 3U cubesat built by students at the University of Roma La Sapienza,
including a group of Iraqi students. The satellite was funded by the Iraqi Ministry
of Science and Technology. (The Iraqi name for the satellite in Arabic is 'Tigris',
the name used by the Italians is 'Tigrisat'.)


Lemur 1 is a 3U technology development cubesat for NanoSatisfi Inc. of San Francisco
with a 5 m resolution Earth imaging system.

ANTELSAT is a 2U cubesat from ANTEL (Administracion Nacional de Telecomunicaciones) of Uruguay
and the University of the Republic in Montevideo.

Aerocube 6 is a 1U cubesat from the Aerospace Corporation (El Segundo, California)
which separated into two 0.5U halves around Jun 22. The satellites carry radiation
dosimeters and are testing upgraded systems for the Aerocube series.

BRITE-Toronto and BRITE-Montreal are Canadian astroseismology observatories with
small telescopes for observation of oscillations of bright stars. It is believed that
BRITE-Montreal failed to separate from the Dnepr final stage and remains 
in its deployer in a 608 x 1453 km x 97.9 deg orbit. (The Dnepr final stage continues
propulsive burning while deploying its payloads, and always ends up in a higher apogee
orbit.)

Eleven Flock-1c satellites for PlanetLabs replenish their constellation of 3U satellites,
each with 3-m-resolution Earth imaging payloads. 28 Flock-1 satellites were launched earlier
this year, but according to Space-Track all but three have now reentered.

PSLV cluster
-------------

India's Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle put France's SPOT 7 imaging satellite
in orbit on Jun 30. Small satellites from Canada, Germany and Singapore were
ejected as well. CanX-4 and CanX-5 will perform a formation flying experiment.
The Germany agency DLR's AISat-1 carries a ship tracking AIS payload, not to be
confused with Norway's AISSat-1. VELOX-I N-Sat is a 3U cubesat from Nanyang Tech U.
in Singapore, and will eject the tiny 0.25 kg VELOX-I P-Sat.

OCO-2
-----

The Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 was launched on Jul 2 into a 688 x 694 km x 98.2 deg 
0135 LTDN orbit. It carries a near-IR spectrometer with three bands (two CO2 and one O2)
to map global CO2 sources and sinks. It replaces OCO-1, lost in a launch failure in 2009.
This was the first use of the semi-retired Delta II rocket since 2011.

The Delta 2 second stage made two depletion burns, first to 604 x 3743 km and finally
to 2375 x 10139 km.


Gonets-M
--------

Three Gonets-M low Earth orbit message relay satellites were placed in a 1480 x 1510 km x 82.5 deg
orbit by a Rokot vehicle on Jul 3. The Briz-KM stage (serial number 72522 according to Rui
Barbosa's www.zenite.nu/orbita) made a depletion burn to 1162 x 1505 km.


Meteor-M
--------

On Jul 8 at 1558 UTC Russia launched a Soyuz-2-1B with a Fregat upper
stage. The Blok-I stage entered a 183 x 198 km orbit; the Fregat then
maneuvered to 191 x 813 km and 818 x 828 km x 98.8 deg, where it
deployed the Meteor-M No. 2 weather satellite in an 0900LTDN SSO. The
Fregat then restarted at 1736 UTC to enter a 638 x 825 km orbit, ejected
a payload adapter frame and the Relek (MKA-FKI) satellite which will
study relativistic electrons in the magnetosphere. A further burn to 635
x 635 km was followed by deployment at 1828 to 1832 UTC of the TDS-1,
SkySat-2, DX-1, AISSat-2, and UKube-1 satellites. A mass model of
Canada's M3MSat was also ejected; the actual M3MSat was pulled from the
launch following the Ukraine crisis.

TDS-1 is a UK technology demonstration satellite built by Surrey Satellite.
UKube-1 is a 3U cubesat from ClydeSpace, the first satellite to be built in Scotland.
DX-1 is a technology satellite from the Russian private company Dauria Aerospace.
SkySat-2 is Skybox Imaging's second Earth observing satellite.
AISSAT-2 is a Norwegian-owned, Canadian-built AIS (ship tracking) satellite.

At 1926 UTC the Fregat stage made a deorbit burn to 14 x 665 km and reentered
over the S Pacific at about 2010 UTC. The Blok-I third stage reentered
over southern Australia at 1142 UTC on Jul 10 in a widely observed fireball.

O3b
----

The second quartet of O3b communications satellites was launched by Soyuz from
the Centre Spatial Guyanais on Jul 10 into 7830 x 7840 km x 0.0 deg orbits.
The Fregat stage was left in a 7657 x 7692 km orbit. O3B Networks Ltd, based
in the UK Channel Islands, intends to provide space-based broadband service
to the `other 3 billion' people without internet access. The 700 kg satellites
are built by Thales Alenia/Roma.

Suborbital missions
-------------------

The FTG-06B missile defense test on Jun 22 saw the intercept of a target launched by
a Trident-I-based LV-2 missile launched from Kwajalaein Atoll, using an EKV CE-II interceptor
launched on a GBI missile from Vandenberg AFB in California.

A Terrier-Improved-Malemute rocket was launched from Wallops I on Jul 2 carrying the
SubTec-6 payload. However the second stage tumbled during its burn, and the payload
only reached 8 km altitude.

The Angara-1.2PP rocket was launched from Plesetsk on Jul 9 on a suborbital flight
to test components of the Angara satellite launch vehicle. According to Rui Barbosa's

The Space Shuttle Atlantis was launched on mission STS-37
on Friday morning, April 5. Your correspondent was at the
viewing site for his first launch and is still totally blown
away by the experience. I bought myself a good pair of 
binoculars last week and am very glad I did; I was able to
see the orbiter windows and wing markings while it sat on
the pad a few miles away. Discovery was a little to the
right and closer, covered by the rotating service structure.
Rain hitting the motel roof all through the night was very
depressing, but the USAF forecasters seem to know their stuff-
it was warm and sunny by the time we got to the site, although
there was low cloud over the landing strip. We were able to follow
the launch for about 4 minutes, well after SRB sep - it became 
a bright pinpoint of light going off into the distance. It
was actually a lot quieter than I expected, but visually
overwhelming. Worth the 730-mile drive from Huntsville.
The day before, I drove to Patrick AFB a few miles south and
saw the astronaut T-38's lined up on the tarmac.

GRO was deployed on Apr 7 after a contingency EVA was performed
by astronauts Ross and Apt to free the spacecraft's main antenna.
Another EVA is due today.

Launch of STS-39/Discovery and the AFP-675 payload
from LC39A is due for late April.

Viktor Afanas'ev and Musa Manarov continue in orbit aboard the
Mir/Kvant/Kvant-2/Kristall/Soyuz TM-11/Progress M-7 complex.  

The Anik E2 hybrid C-band/Ku-band comsat was launched by Ariane
on Apr 4 for the Telesat Canada Corp.

10 years ago:  12 Apr 1981. Space Shuttle OV-102 Columbia was
launched on mission STS-1, the first space shuttle flight.
Crew were John Young and Robert Crippen. STS-1 was the first
orbital flight by a winged piloted spaceship, the first
spacecraft to return from orbit to land on a runway, the
first flight test of the reuseable thermal tiles, the first
piloted vehicle to make substantial aerodynamic maneuvers 
at velocities in excess of Mach 8, and the first piloted spaceship
to be launched with the help of solid propellant rockets.

20 years ago:  4 Apr 1971 The Kosmos-404 killer satellite made a flyby
of the Kosmos-400 target at 1000 km altitude and was then deorbited.

30 years ago: 12 Apr 1961. Yuriy Alekseevich Gagarin became the first
human in space. He made just under one orbit of the Earth in the spaceship
Vostok, which was launched from Kosmodrom Baykonur in Kazakhstan. The
flight lasted 1 hour and 48 minutes.

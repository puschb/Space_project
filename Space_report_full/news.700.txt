International Space Station
---------------------------

Expedition 40 is continuing with ISS in a 410 x 419 km x 51.7 deg orbit.
ISS Commander is Steve Swanson (NASA); flight engineers are FE-1 Aleksandr
Skvortsov (Roskosmos), FE-2 Oleg Artemev (Roskosmos), FE-4 Max Suraev (Roskosmos),
FE-5 Reid Wiseman (NASA), FE-6 Alexander Gerst (ESA).
The past month has seen extensive activity with cargo ships:
 - The SS Janice Voss cargo freighter, on flight Orb-2, has arrived at the
ISS. The SSRMS arm grappled it at 1036 UTC on Jul 16 and berthed it on
the Harmony module at 1253 UTC. 

 - Progress M-23M undocked from the Pirs module at 2144 UTC on Jul 21
and carried out 10 days of independent operations as part of the Radar-Progress
experiment program. It was deorbited on Jul 31, with an engine burn over
Russia at 2151 UTC lowering the orbit from 351 x 417 km to 58 x 413 km,
leading to reentry at 2230 UTC and debris impact at 2243 UTC in the South Pacific.

 - Progress M-24M (vehicle 423) was launched on Jul 23 on flight 56P into a
189 x 204 km orbit;  it docked with the Pirs module at 0331 UTC Jul 24.

 - ESA's Automated Transfer Vehicle 5 'Georges Lemaitre' was launched on Jul 29
and arrived at the ISS on Aug 12, docking with Zvezda at 1330 UTC. Launch mass
of ATV 5 was 19926 kg.

Orbcomm
-------

A SpaceX Falcon 9 flew to a 614 x 749 km x 47.0 deg orbit on Jul 14 to deploy
a set of six VHF messaging relay satellites for Orbcomm. The second stage
carried two ESPA rings (developed for EELV auxilary payloads) each carrying
four slots for the 172 kg satellites; the two extra slots were filled with
mass dummies which remained attached.

The Falcon 9 first stage made a flyback maneuver and deployed landing legs
as part of engineering tests for future recovery; the stage was destroyed
as it landed on the ocean.

Foton-M
--------

Foton-M No. 4 was launched from Baykonur on Jul 18 by a Soyuz-2-1A into
a 252 x 552 km x 64.9 deg orbit. This Foton-M, while retaining the
Vostok spherical cabin, uses the new extended length service module
(probably derived from the Yantar' series?). Microgravity and life
sciences experiments are on board; life science speciments include geckos and tardigrades;
I don't know the specific species of gecko used. The return capsule
includes samples exposed on the exterior for reentry studies.

On Jul 24 it was revealed that the satellite was not responding to ground
commands, although it continued to send back telemetry. Control was later
reported to have been regained, but a scheduled orbit raise burn was cancelled
and on Aug 12 the orbit was still 250 x 542 km.

Nicolas Pillet points out that this mission is the first 34KSM Foton-M spacecraft;
the previous three missions, although named Foton-M, were spacecraft number 13 to 15
in the original 34KS Foton series.

Cassini
-------

Cassini completed the T-103 flyby of Titan at 1042 UTC Jul 20. Closest
approach was 5103 km above that world. Cassini is now in a 909900 x 2852000 km x 48.0 deg
orbit around Saturn, and reached apoapsis (apochronon) 208 on Aug 3.

ISEE-3
------

ISEE-3 continues to approach its lunar flyby as the Reboot Project begins science operations
with it. The probe's propulsion system is not working and attempts to recapture the satellite in the
Earth-Moon system have been abandoned.

ISEE-3 was in a 0.927 x 1.035 AU x 0.1 deg orbit around the Sun before its Earth approach; the
burn in early July did not significantly affect this. It entered the Earth's sphere of influence
on Aug 3 on a 42.5 deg inclination trajectory and will pass through a 178400 km perigee on Aug 9
before entering the lunar sphere of influence at about 1015 UTC Aug 10. Perilune is 15938 km
at 1927 UTC Aug 10; ISEE-3 will leave the Earth-Moon system on Aug 14, passing the L1 radius on
Aug 17 and entering a 1.012 x 1.190 AU x 1.17 deg solar orbit, having increased its solar
orbital period by 66.9 days to 422 days. (Data calculated from the ephemeris on JPL HORIZONS).


AFSPC-4
-------

United Launch Alliance launched a Delta 4 rocket on Jul 28 with three
payloads. GSSAP 1 and 2, built by Orbital for US Air Force Space
Command, will catalog satellites and space debris in geostationary 
orbit. ANGELS is a smaller satellite, around 70 kg, for the Air Force
Research Lab  and will make observations of the Delta rocket's second stage
at ranges from 50 km down to a few km, for further development of satellite
inspection technology. The exact orbit of the satellites is not known
but is probably a few hundred km below GEO.


GPS 68
------

Global Positioning System space vehicle 68 was launched from Cape Canaveral on Aug
2 aboard an Atlas V 401 (serial AV-048). The mission, flight GPS IIF-7 'Capella',
reached a 167 x 20260 km x 55 deg transfer orbit at 0340 UTC. A second Centaur
burn at 0640 UTC circularized the orbit, which on Aug 12 was 20450 x 20478 km x 55.0 deg.

Asiasat 8
---------

SpaceX launched a Falcon 9 on Aug 5 carrying the Asiasat 8 satellite for
Asiasat of Hong Kong. The Loral LS-1300LL satellite has a 4535 kg mass
at separation (thanks to Asiasat for this data)  and uses an R-4D 
bipropellant thruster to reach GEO. The first R-4D burn on Aug 6 raised
the orbit from 180 x 35762 km x 24.3 deg to 7137 x 35751 km x 10.7 deg.
By Aug 11 the satellite was in a 35725 x 35732 km x 0.1  deg orbit
drifting east over 104E.

Yaogan 20
---------

China launched a CZ-4C rocket from Jiuquan on Aug 9 and deployed a
cluster of three Yaogan satellites into a 1086 x 1103 km x 63.4 deg
orbit. This triplet is the fourth in a series; previous triplet clusters
were Yaogan 9, 16 and 17. They are thought to be analogous to the old US
NOSS/PARCAE ocean surveillance system.


Erratum
--------

Canopus Systems is an independent affiliate of Dauria Aerospace, not a subsidiary.
Thanks to Tomas Svitek for the clarification.

Suborbital missions
-------------------

Reports from northern China suggest a missile test of some kind occured on Jul 10 but this
has not been confirmed. However China did carry out a missile defense test on Jul 23.

Japan's JAXA agency launched an S-310 rocket on Aug 4 to carry out an engineering study
of cryogenic fluid flow for future rocket stages.

A solar EUV spectrometer package, the Degradation Free Spectrometers payload,
flew on NASA 36.289 from White Sands on Jul 22.

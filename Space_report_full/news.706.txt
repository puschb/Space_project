Erratum
--------

Henry Spencer points out that I omitted the Stardust flyby at 181 km of
comet 9P/Tempel 1 on 2011 Feb 15 at 0439UTC from my list of comet
missions.

International Space Station
---------------------------

Expedition 42 continues with commander Barry Wilmore, FE-1 Aleksandr Samokutyaev and FE-2 Elena Serova.
Soyuz TMA-15M was launched at 2101 UTC Nov 23 with Anton Shkaplerov, Terry Virts and Samantha
Cristoforetti. It docked with the Rassvet at 0249 UTC Nov 24.

On Nov 28 the Japanese JEM-RMS robot arm extracted the SSIKLOPS (Cyclops) deployer and its attached
SpinSat satellite from the Kibo airlock and positioned it for deployment. The Cyclops then ejected
SpinSat into orbit (at 1430:42 UTC, per information from the principal investigator at NRL.)
SpinSat is a 50 kg Naval Research Lab satellite to test new microthrusters for attitude control.
SpinSat has been cataloged as 1998-067FL.

Orion EFT-1
-----------

Exploration Flight Test 1 was carried out on Dec 5. EFT-1 used an Orion Crew Module (probably
around 9400 kg) with a LAS escape tower atop a dummy Service Module with jettisonable side panels,
which in turn is fixed to the OSA (Orion-to-Stage-Adapter). This vehicle was mounted on the second
stage of a Delta IV Heavy vehicle, Delta 369.

Delta 369's second stage was inserted into a 185 x 888 km x 28.8 deg orbit at 1222 UTC, 17 minutes after
launch from Cape Canaveral. The stage made a second burn at 1400 UTC, entering a -37 x 5807 km
orbit; apogee was at 1510 UTC. At 1528 UTC the Orion CM separated from the stage. At 1550 UTC
Delta 369 made a third burn of unknown delta-V, accelerating its reentry which occurred at 1616 UTC.
The Orion CM made a small RCS adjust burn at 1602 UTC and entered the atmosphere at 8.9 km/s at 1618 UTC,
landing at 1629 UTC off Baja California at 23.60N 116.46W. It was recovered by USS Anchorage.

Three objects were cataloged by USSTRATCOM. Object 40331 (2014-077C),
seen in the SECO-1 orbit during the mission, may be short-lived debris
from the Delta or even a bookkeeping error, since no new elsets have
been released since the flight.


Reentry Return Flight Vehicle Service Module
--------------------------------------------

China's latest lunar probe, now referred to as the Lunar Exploration
Program Phase 3's Return Reentry Flight Vehicle Service Module (Tanyue
gongcheng san qi zai ru fanhui feixingqi fuwu cang), entered a 20000 x
40000 x 35000 km Lissajous orbit around the Earth-Moon L2 Lagrange point
on Nov 28. EML2 is 61000 km from the Moon and 446000 km from Earth's
center; the probe makes two orbits around the point each month.


Kosmos-2499
-----------

AMSAT report that Kosmos-2499 activated an amateur radio payload, RS-47,
on Nov 30. Kosmos-2499 remains in a similar orbit to the Briz-M rocket
stage after its Nov 9 rendezvous, but analysis by Bob Christy reported
at twitter.com/zarya_info reveals that the two satellites are now
drifting slowly apart. The earlier mystery satellite in the same
series, Kosmos-2491, has also activated an amateur radio payload (RS-46).


Yaogan 24
---------

China launched Yaogan 24 on Nov 20 into a 630 x 652 km SSO. The
satellite is an imaging spy satellite in the same series as Yaogan 2, 4,
7, 11. The CZ-2D second stage was deorbited after deploying the
satellite.

Kuaizhou 2
----------

The second launch of the Chinese 2nd Artillery's operationally
responsive Kuaizhou (Swift Boat) launch vehicle on Nov 21 placed
Kuaizhou-2 in a 284 x 300 km x 96.6 deg orbit, with 1300 local time
descending node. Kuaizhou 1 was launched to a similar orbit with 1100
LTDN in Sep 2013; after  regular maintenance burns for a year, during
Oct 2014 Kuaizhou 1's orbit was raised to 365 x 390 km.

Glonass-K No. 12
----------------

The second Glonass-K satellite, vehicle No. 12, was launched by Soyuz-2-1B
from Plesetsk on Nov 30. The Glonass-K series are the third generation
of Russian high orbit navigation satellites, following the original Uragan/Glonass and
their successors, the Uragan-M/Glonass-M vehicles. 

The fun with inconsistently assigned Kosmos numbers continues. In the
latest episode, the Glonass-K vehicle has apparently been assigned the
cover name Kosmos-2502. If so, Kosmos-2501 is most likely assigned to
the military Luch satellite launched Sep 27. However, there are
suggestions that the statement at
http://www.sdcm.ru/smglo/news?version=rus&repdate&site=extern is
incorrect and will be amended so that the Glonass satellite is 2501.

Hayabusa 2
----------

Japan's Hayabusa-2 space probe was launched into solar orbit on Dec 2 by
the H-IIA-26 rocket. The probe is intended to rendezvous with asteroid
1999 JU3, survey it from orbit, touch down briefly to sample the
surface, and return samples to Earth. Five small, beanbag-like 'target
markers' can be ejected onto the surface in advance to help guide the
vehicle. Hayabusa-2 also carries three 1 kg class lander/hopper devices,
Minerva II-1a, II-1b and II-2, which will be ejected onto the surface,
together with a 10 kg German-built lander called MASCOT. Hayabusa-2 will
also eject a 'Self-Contained Impactor' (SCI) device onto the surface. As
the parent spacecraft scoots off to the side it will further eject the
DCAM-3 camera subsatellite, which will monitor detonation of SCI's high
explosive, intended to ram the SCI's body into the asteroid and generate
an artificial crater.

The second stage of the H-IIA deployed three further spacecraft into
solar orbit. The most unusual is DESPATCH (ArtSat-2) from Tama Art
University. The yellowish, tapered-helix assembly is intended mainly as
a work of art although it also carries an amateur radio communications
payload with a limited range. Shin'en-2 has a more ambitious
communications payload designed to demonstrate deep space communications
with a small spacecraft, and PROCYON is a small spacecraft experiment to
test interplanetary navigation with an ion engine. PROCYON will be sent
to a different asteroid from Hayabusa-2; which one hasn't been decided
yet, and will depend on the actual trajectory it's been launched into.

Launched into a 245 x -50902 km x 29.9 deg hyperbola with C3=21.03
km**2/s**2, Hayabusa-2 and its fellow travellers left the Earth-Moon
system on Dec 6, passing the distance of the L1 point at around 2030
UTC, and antered a 0.915 x 1.089 AU x 6.8 deg solar orbit. (These
numbers are based on the expected prelaunch trajectory given on JPL Horizons).

Ariane VA221
------------

Arianespace flight VA221 used Ariane 5ECA vehicle 575, delivering two
communications satellites into geotransfer orbit. GSAT-16 for the Indian
Space Research Organization has Ku and C band communications payloads
for increased capacity at 55 deg E. DirecTV 14 for DirecTV is an SSL-MDA 1300
satellite with a mass of 6300 kg full. It will be stationed at 99 deg W
for television broadcasting.

CBERS 4
-------

China-Brazil Earth Resources Satellite 4 (Zhong-badiqiu ziyuan weixing 04 xing)
was launched on Dec 7 into a 741 x 752 km x 98.5 deg orbit with 10:30 local
time descending node. The uprated ZY-1 class satellite replaced CBERS 3
which was lost in a launch failure one year ago.


Note: I have enhanced the table of orbital launches. It's extra work, so I don't promise
to keep doing it this way. Catalog numbers beginning with S refer to the US space surveillance
catalog; other catalog numbers (e.g. A and F designations) are my own auxiliary catalogs.

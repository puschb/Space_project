International Space Station
---------------------------

Expedition 42 continues with commander Barry Wilmore, FE-1 Aleksandr
Samokutyaev, FE-2 Elena Serova, FE-3 Anton Shkaplerov, FE-4 Samantha
Cristoforetti, and FE-5 Terry Virts. Soyuz TMA-14M is docked at Poisk;
Soyuz TMA-15M is docked at Rassvet; Progress M-25M is docked at Pirs;
ATV-5 Georges Lemaitre is docked at Zvezda. 

Dragon CRS-5 (SC7) was launched from Cape Canaveral on Jan 10 into a 206
x 353 km x 51.6 deg orbit. The 9700 kg spacecraft carries 1823 kg of
internal cargo and the 494 kg CATS lidar experiment from NASA-GSFC in
the trunk. Inside Dragon are two PlanetLabs Flock-1d' cubesats and the
AESP-14 1U cubesat from Brazil's space agency AEB and the ITA technical
institute. On Jan 12 Dragon was grappled by the SSRMS arm at 1054 UTC
and berthed on the Harmony module at 1354 UTC. The cubesats were
transferred internally to the Kibo module and will be deployed from the
Kibo airlock. CATS was grappled by the Dextre robot on 2015 Jan 22 and
unberthed from Dragon around 0700 UTC; it was then handed off to the
JEM-RMS at around 1030 UTC and installed on the Kibo Exposed Facility at
location EFU3 at about 1400 UTC.


The Falcon 9 first stage performed a flyback attempt to land around 360
km downrange at circa 78W 31N. The stage made a 'hard' landing on the
ASDS (Autonomous Spaceport Drone Ship). The first stage was destroyed
when hydraulic fluid depletion made it tip over ahd hit the deck
sideways, but the incident did not cause serious damage to the ship. The
ASDS has now been renamed "Just Read The Instructions" after the name of
an AI spaceship in the book 'The Player of Games' by the late science
fiction writer Iain M. Banks.


RRTV-SM
-------

China's Reentry Return Test Vehicle Service Module departed the
Earth-Moon L2 region on Jan 4 at 1500 UTC, arriving in a 200 x 5300 km
lunar orbit at 0700 UTC on Jan 11. Following two further lunar orbit
burns on Jan 12 and 13 it is now in a 200 x 200 km x 43.7 deg orbit
around the Moon.


Beagle 2
---------

The UK Mars probe Beagle 2 was never heard from after it entered the
Martian atmosphere on 2003 Dec 25. It has now been discovered on the
surface in Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter images at 90.4295E, 11.5265N 
(position measured by Doug Ellison from the released image), apparently
intact and with at least one solar panel deployed.

MUOS 3
------

The US Navy MUOS 3 communications satellite was launched into
geotransfer orbit by an Atlas V 551 rocket on Jan 21. MUOS 3 has a mass
of around 6800 kg.

SMAP
----

The Soil Moisture Active Passive satellite, developed by JPL, was
launched into polar orbit on Jan 31. SMAP carries a 6-m L-band antenna
for synthetic aperture radar and radiometry measurements to map
microwave emissions from water molecules in the soil. The 944 kg
satellite  was launched aboard a Boeing/ULA Delta II rocket along with
four cubesats:  the 3U Cal Poly CP10 ExoCube, the 3U Michigan/JPL GRIFEX
technology satellite, and the second pair of 1.5U NSF/Montana State/U.
New Hampshire FIREBIRD space science satellites.

IGS R-Spare
-----------

The Radar Spare satellite (Reda Yobiki) in the Information Gathering Satellite (Joho Shushu Eisei)
series was launched on Feb 1 aboard an H-IIA 202 (flight F27) from Tanegashima.
The IGS satellites are operated by Japan's Cabinet Satellite Intelligence Center.

   Optical-2 and Demo Sat ('jissho eisei') have apparently not been
   tracked by hobbyists since last summer. Optical-5 is scheduled for
   launch in the near future.

   (LTDN = Local time of the orbit descending node for a sun-synchronous orbit).

Inmarsat 5-F2
-------------

The second satellite in the Inmarsat 5 series was launched on Feb 1 by Proton from Baykonur
into a supersynchronous geotransfer orbit. The 6070 kg spacecraft is a Boeing 702HP model
with Ka-band mobile broadband capacity for Inmarsat Global. 

Fajr
----

Iran has launched its fourth satellite, its first successful orbital
launch since Feb 2012.  Fajr (Aurora) is a 52 kg  technology payload with a
cold-gas thruster developed by Iran Electronics Industries. There is
suggestive evidence (mostly based on satellite imagery of launch pad
damage revealed by the magazine Jane's Intelligence Review) that Iran
had two launch failures in 2012, as well as more speculative evidence of
further launch failures since then. 


Erratum
-------

The FY satellites are operated by China's National Satellite Meteorological Centre
(Guojia weixing qixiang zhongxin), established in 1971.

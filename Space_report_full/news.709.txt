International Space Station
---------------------------

Expedition 42 continues with commander Barry Wilmore, FE-1 Aleksandr
Samokutyaev, FE-2 Elena Serova, FE-3 Anton Shkaplerov, FE-4 Samantha
Cristoforetti, and FE-5 Terry Virts. Soyuz TMA-14M is docked at Poisk;
Soyuz TMA-15M is docked at Rassvet; Progress M-25M is docked at Pirs and
Progress M-26M at Zvezda.

ISS cubesat deploys resumed on Feb 5 after a five-month hiatus following
deployer problems. Brazil's AESP-14 cubesat was ejected at 1250 UTC Feb
5, but appears not to be transmitting.

The Dragon CRS-5 cargo vehicle was unberthed form Harmony at about 1700
UTC Feb 10 by the SSRMS arm, which released it at 1910 UTC. The Dragon
made its deorbit burn at 2349 UTC, with trunk separation at 0005 UTC Feb
11 and splashdown at about 0044 UTC. Six of the PlanetLabs Flock-1b
cubesats (Nos. 3, 4, 13, 14, 19, 20) were returned to Earth aboard CRS-5
without having been deployed, after 212 days in space. (Thanks to H.
Hallam of PlanetLabs for data).

The European cargo ship ATV-5 "Georges Lema√Ætre" undocked from the ISS
Zvezda module at 1342 UTC Feb 14 and was deorbited over the Pacific on Feb 15.
The Russian cargo ship Progress M-26M was launched on Feb 17 at 1100 UTC
and docked with Zvezda at 1657 UTC the same day.

On Feb 21 astronauts Wilmore and Virts made spacewalk US EVA-29 from the
Quest module. The crew lock was depressurized by 1240 UTC and the hatch
opened at 1242 UTC. The astronauts took the two IDA Cable Bags, A and B,
and installed them on the end of the Harmony module. I believe the bags
were launched aboard Dragon CRS-5.

Each bag contained four IPIM (IDA Preparation ISS Mod) cables which will
route power and data to the IDA-1 and IDA-2 international docking
adapters. The IDAs will be installed on the PMA-2 and PMA-3 Shuttle
docking ports later this year to allow direct docking of Dragon and
CST-100 ships to the Station. Cables W2254, W2256, W2258, and W2262 from
Bag A and W2252, W2272 from Bag B were installed and routed between
PMA-2, Harmony and Destiny. Bag A was returned to the airlock at the end
of the spacewalk. Cables W2264 and W2253 remain in Bag B and would be
installed on the next EVA. The astronauts closed the Quest hatch at
around 1918 UTC and began airlock repressurization at 1926 UTC.

On Feb 25, Wilmore and Virts headed out again on US EVA-30. The
remaining two cables were installed, and the soft thermal cover was
removed from the PMA-2 docking port. The cover was launched on HTV-3 in
Jul 2012 and installed on PMA-2 during spacewalk US EVA-22 on 2013 Jul
9. The cover and IDA Bag B  were returned to the airlock, after which
Virts performed several hours of lubrication work on the Canadarm-2's
LEE-A (Latching End Effector, the part that actually grabs things) and
Wilmore installed wire ties on the P1 and S1 truss segments to prepare
for communications cabling on the next EVA. The spacewalk begain with
airlock depressurization around 1142 UTC and hatch opening around 1148
UTC, with the astronauts on battery power at 1151 UTC. The hatch was
closed at 1829 UTC and repressurization was at 1834 UTC.

The third and last in the current set of spacewalks, EVA-31 on Mar 1,
saw the installation of the C2V2 antennae and associated cabling on
the P3 and S3 truss segments. The C2V2 system will provide communications links
to the Dragon 2 and CST-100 visting commercial crew spaceships.

On Feb 27 deployments of PlanetLabs cubesats resumed with the ejection
of Flock 1b-27, 28. These satellites were launched on Cygnus ORB-2 last
July. Between Feb 27 and Mar 5, in addition to further Flock 1b
satellites and the two Flock-1d' that went up on CRS-5, NanoRacks
commanded deployment of the TechEdSat-4, GEARRS, MicroMAS and LambdaSat
cubesats. 


IXV
---

The Arianespace/ESA Vega rocket made its fourth flight from Kourou on Feb 11.
The Vega VV04 took off at 1340 UTC, with the AVUM 4th stage entering a 76 x 416 km x 5.4 deg
orbit at 1353 UTC. The payload was ESA's Intermediate Experimental Vehicle, the IXV,
an 1845 kg reentry vehicle to study hypersonic aerothermodynamics. The IXV reentered
over the Pacific at 1444 UTC, with parachute deployment at 1509 UTC and
splashdown at 123W 3N at about 1518 UTC.

The AVUM stage made a second burn at apogee at 1411 UTC.  Although
details have not been officially revealed, according to user SCE on the
Novosti Kosmonavtiki forum, it entered a 220 x 430 km x 5 deg orbit. A
third burn followed at 1529 UTC as the AVUM passed over Kourou again, to
deorbit the stage after one trip around Earth; the AVUM reentered over
the Indian Ocean around 1600 to 1615 UTC.

By traditional NORAD rules, the AVUM stage should have received a launch
number of 2015-007 and a catalog number, but this appears not to have
happened. I have therefore added it to my supplementary catalog of
unnumbered objects, and given the launch a designation in my 'U' series,
2015-U01.   The last such case was 1995-U01, the Japanese launch of
Germany's EXPRESS, which made several orbits but was not cataloged. 

I am also interested in launches  which had orbital energy even if they
did not complete one orbit; these do not deserve launch numbers by the
old NORAD rules, but I assign U codes to them too. Recent examples are
2001-U01 (Taurus 6 launch failure); 2003-U01 (Chinese KT-1 launch
failure); 2004-U01 (Soyuz-2-1A suborbital test); 2013-U01 (Chinese
Kunpeng-7 high altitude probe). Reports that ASTRO E made it to a
postive-perigee orbit of 80 x 410 km led me to give it designation
2000-U01, but more recent information makes it more likely that the
perigee was negative,  perhaps -1200 km.


Fajr
----

Iran's Fajr satellite does not seem to have made any orbital maneuvers.
The orbit decayed from an initial 223 x 470 km to 196 x 293 km by Feb 22, and then 
after falling to 134 x 155 km early on Feb 26 it reentered. The Safir rocket stage
orbit decayed a bit more slowly, and was 203 x 325 km on Feb 26.

ABS/Eutelsat
------------

SpaceX launched the 16th Falcon 9 on Mar 2 carrying a dual
communications satellite payload to supersynchronous transfer orbit.
Falcon 9 reached a 174 x 953 km parking orbit 9 min after launch, and
then made a second burn over the equator to reach about 391 x 63452 km x 
24.8 deg. This orbit appears to be about 500 km lower in apogee
(corresponding to only 10 meters per second shortfall in velocity) than planned.

The two payloads were 2000 kg Boeing BSS-702SP models with
XIPS-25 ion thrusters as their main propulsion system. ABS-3A, for Asia
Broadcast Satellite of Hong Kong, was launched directly attached to the
lower satellite, Eutelsat 115 West B, until it separated from the stack
following stage 2 second cutoff. Eutelsat 115 West B is owned by
Eutelsat Americas (Mexico City), and was called Satmex 7. Satmex was
taken over by Europe's Eutelsat and renamed Eutelsat Americas in Mar
2014.

TigriSat
--------

Italy has registered the TigriSat satellite (see JSR 699) with the UN, noting that it is owned
by the Univ. Roma La Sapienza, despite the fact that earlier Iraqi media reports suggested
that the satellite was Iraqi-funded and -owned. The satellite was built by Iraqi students
studying at the Italian university.



DMSP F-13
---------

46 new debris objects have been cataloged associated with the DMSP F-13 satellite,
a US Air Force weather satellite which was launched in 1995 and has been semi-retired
since 2009. According to calculations by T.S. Kelso, the debris was released on Feb 3.
According to USAF sources quoted in the media the event was preceded by a temperature
spike and it seems likely that the spacecraft battery exploded.


UN Registration
----------------

I have updated my analysis of registration of satellites with the United
Nations at http://planet4589.org/space/un/un_paper1.html. For the period
1957-2013, 95 percent of satellite payloads have been registered with
the UN. That leaves 340 unregistered payloads.

Table of Recent (suborbital) Launches
----------------------------------

Bill Gertz (Washington Free Beacon) reports launch on Jan 23 of a new
North Korean missile, called KN-11 by the US government, from a submerged test pad.

Three rockets were launched from Wallops over a 30 second period on Feb
24 for the FTX-19 experiment in which several US Navy Aegis missile
defense ships tracked the rocket payloads. This was basically a software
test and no Aegis interceptor missiles were launched.

The MOSC 2 (Metal Oxide Space Cloud) experiment from the US Air Force Research Lab
was launched on Feb 25 on a NASA sounding rocket, flight 36.299DR.

The US Navy test-launched two Trident missiles on Feb 22 off the coast of California,
probably sending its reentry vehicles (RVs) towards Kwajalein.
The Pacific Ocean launches of Trident are treated with more secrecy than East Coast ones,
and it is not known which Ohio-class sub performed the launches.

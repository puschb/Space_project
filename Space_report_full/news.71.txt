Atlantis landed at 1355 UT on Apr 11, on lakebed runway 33
at Edwards AFB, after 143 hours and 32 minutes in space.
After 8 flights, Atlantis has flown 952 hr 15 min.
Activation of GRO is proceeding smoothly so far.
Launch of STS 39/Discovery is due for Apr 23 at 07:05 EST.

Viktor Afanas'ev and Musa Manarov continue in orbit aboard the
Mir/Kvant/Kvant-2/Kristall/Soyuz TM-11/Progress M-7 complex.  
Launch of Soyuz TM-12 remains due for May 12.

The Almaz radar satellite was launched by 3-stage Proton from
Baykonur on Mar 31. The satellite design is related to the
Salyut/Mir space stations, and was originally intended
as part of a piloted military space station project also
called Almaz. The original Almaz project was cancelled in
the late 1970s and the crews transferred to Soyuz and Buran
training. The current Almaz satellite was preceded by 
a simpler version, Kosmos-1870, in 1987. Data from the 
satellite will be commercially available.

A 4-stage Proton launched three GLONASS navigation satellites,
Kosmos-2139, Kosmos-2140, and Kosmos-2141, on Apr 4.

The ASC 2 television relay satellite was launched on Apr 12
by a Delta 7925. The ASC satellites were originally planned
by American Satellite Corp (Amersat). The company was bought
by Continental Telecommunications Inc (Contel) before the first one was
launched, and became Contel ASC. ASC 1 was launched 
on 27 Aug 1985 by a PAM-D rocket from the spaceship Discovery.
In Mar 1991, General Telephone and Electronics (GTE) merged with 
Contel, and Contel ASC is being merged with the GTE Spacenet Corp.
After on orbit checkout by Contel ASC, the new ASC 2 satellite
will be renamed Spacenet 4. GTE already has two fleets of satellites:
Gstar and Spacenet. Gstar was its original fleet; the Spacenet
satellites were built by Southern Pacific Communications (SPC).
SPC was bought up by GTE before the first Spacenet was launched.
The full GTE fleet is:

10 years ago:  21 Apr 1981. Kosmos-1266, the 19th Soviet
nuclear reactor satellite, was launched from Baykonur.
Its reactor powered a radar intended to track naval vessels.
However the spacecraft malfunctioned and on Apr 29 the 
reactor was separated and moved to a 950 km high orbit
where it will remain for several centuries. Its companion
satellite, Kosmos-1249, continued operating until Jun 1981.

20 years ago:  19 Apr 1971 The first Salyut space station was
launched on a 3-stage Proton rocket from Baykonur. Salyut
was a pressurised laboratory with a solar telescope and other
instruments. The Soyuz 11 crew later spent a month aboard it.

30 years ago:  Apr 1961. The week following the flight
of Vostok was rather quiet, with tests of Pershing,
Jupiter and Polaris ballistic missiles.

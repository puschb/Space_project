International Space Station
---------------------------

On Mar 11 at 2244 UTC Soyuz TMA-14M undocked from the Poisk module with
Expedition 42 crewmembers Aleksandr Samokutyaev, Barry Wilmore and Elena
Serova. Expedition 43 then began under the command of Terry Virts, with
FE-3 Anton Shkaplerov and FE-4 Samantha Cristoforetti also aboard. The
crew will be rounded out later this month with  Gennadiy Padalka,
Mikhail Kornienko and Scott Kelly who are preparing for launch on Soyuz
TMA-16M. Launch is currently scheduled for Mar 27.

Soyuz TMA-14M performed its deorbit burn at 0116 UTC Mar 12 and landed in 
Kazakhstan at around 0208 UTC.

Soyuz TMA-15M is docked at Rassvet; Progress M-25M is docked at Pirs and
Progress M-26M at Zvezda. 

DSCOVR
------

I inadvertently omitted coverage of the DSCOVR launch from the last JSR.

The Deep Space Climate Observatory, DSCOVR, was launched on Feb 11 after
many years of gestation. Originally a NASA mission called Triana and
centered around its Earth observation camera,  it had at  one point been
scheduled for launch on the fatal STS-107 flight of Columbia, but was
cancelled amid political controversy (it grew out of an idea by
Vice-President Gore for whole-Earth imaging to raise eco-awareness) and
placed in storage. The mission was reactivated as part of a NOAA (US
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) effort to monitor
`space weather', the flux of particles and radiation in the solar wind
and its interaction with the Earth's outer atmosphere. 

DSCOVR is a 425 kg vehicle with an additional 145 kg of hydrazine
propellant, and will be stationed at the Earth-Sun L1 point, 1.5 million
km noonward from Earth. It carries a Faraday cup instrument to measure
solar wind speed, an electron spectrometer and a magnetometer to measure
local plasma and fields, as well as a broad band (0.2 to 100 microns)
radiometer to measure the Earth's total energy output and the Earth
Polychomatic Imaging Camera to return images of the full Earth disk.

DSCOVR was launched on a Falcon 9 from Cape Canaveral into a 184 x 186
km x 37 deg parking orbit; 30 min after launch the Falcon 9 second stage
restarted to boost DSCOVR into a 187 x 1371156 km x 37 deg transfer
orbit. When the probe reaches the L1 point it will enter a Lissajous
orbit, tracing out a complex pattern  around the gravitationally stable
balance point. Radius of this pattern will initially be around 250000
km.

I haven't obtained any orbital ephemeris data yet for DSCOVR, but today a colleague
showed me some of the first science data to arrive. Congrats to the DSCOVR team.

MMS
---

NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission was launched on Mar 13. The
mission consists of four identical spacecraft, each with a mass of 1000
kg plus 400 kg of propellant. The spacecraft will fly in a tetrahedral
formation some tens of kilometres apart to disentangle spatial and
temporal fluctuations in the magnetospheric particle and field
environment. They will deploy wire booms with a span of 112 metres
to measure electric fields.

Use for formation-flying groups of spacecraft to study the magnetosphere
began with Penn State's suborbital 'Mother-Daughter' payload NASA 8.28UI
in Jan 1965. Early projects to use multiple widely separated satellite
platforms for simultaneous magnetosphere measurements included the USSR
2D project (Elektron 1/2 and 3/4) in 1964 and NASA's Interplanetary
Monitoring Platforms A to J in the 1960s and 1970s. The first close pair
of magnetosphere probes was the NASA ISEE-1 and ESA ISEE-2, launched on
the same rocket in Oct 1977. followed by the Interkosmos AUOS-Z/Czech
Magion pair launched in 1978. Further AUOS-Z/Magion pairs were succeeded
by the Interbol/Magion missions of 1995 and 1996. ESA's Cluster II
mission which began in 2000 and continues in operation today introduced
the 4-spacecraft tetrahedron approach that is being used by MMS. (Cluster I's
quartet ended up in the Kourou swamp as a result of the first Ariane 5's 
ill-advised attempt to fly sideways.). The NASA/UC Berkely Themis mission
used five spacecraft in disparate orbits; three remain operating around Earth while
two have been reassigned to the ARTEMIS mission and are orbiting the Moon.

Ekspress AM-7
-------------

A new Ekspress satellite for Russia's Kosmicheskaya Svyaz (Space Comms.
Co.) was launched on Mar 18. It is a Eurostar 3000 built by
AirbusDS/Toulouse and had a launch mass of 5700 kg.

Dawn
----

The Dawn probe flew past Ceres at 1900 UTC Feb 23 at an altitude of
38000 km; after several more days of ion engine thrust it was captured
into orbit around Ceres at 1239 UTC Mar 6, at a distance of 61000 km.
Dawn reached an apocereal height of 75000 km on Mar 18 and then began to
descend towards its initial science orbit; scheduled orbit for Mar 20
was around 13000 x 76000 km x 31 deg.

RRTV-SM
--------

China's Phase 3 Lunar Program's Reentry Return Test Vehicle Service Module 
continues operations in lunar orbit. From Mar 3 to Mar 7 it simulated rendezvous
and docking with an ascent vehicle, maneuvering in a 18 x 180 km orbit.

Zwicky's pellets
-----------------

On 1957 Oct 17 at 0505 UTC the US Air Force launched a sounding rocket,
Aerobee USAF-88, from Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico to an apogee of
114 km. 
The ejected rocket nose cap carried three explosive devices (loosely, 'grenades')
which were detonated at about 80 km altitude. Charge A, built by Thomas Poulter
of Stanford, was expected to accelerate about 0.1 gram of material to very
high velocities of order 14 km/s; Charge B, developed by John Rinehart of Smithsonian
Astrophysical Observatory (SAO) in collaboration with Poulter, was designed to 
accelerate a slightly higher mass of particles to somewhat lower speed; Charge C,
built by Fritz Zwicky of CalTech, used an iron oxide/aluminium thermite mixture
that was intended to accelerate self-luminous material to velocities above 11 km/s.
In the event two meteor trails were seen emanating from the explosion of the
nose cone. Zwicky claimed that his pellet had reached Earth escape velocity
and gone into orbit around the Sun (Engineering and Science, Jan 1958, p 20).
This claim is often repeated uncritically, most recently in a fun article by
Nick D'Alto in Smithsonian's Air and Space magazine:
http://www.airspacemag.com/daily-planet/1957-two-tiny-pellets-were-first-man-made-objects-escape-earths-gravity-180954622/
The article prompted me to look more deeply into the story, of which I've always been
a bit skeptical.

Zwicky was a genius. We revere him in astronomy because so many of his
crazy ideas - like dark matter - turned out to be right - but not all of
them. He is famous for many things, but from what I've heard, accepting
that he might be wrong about something wasn't one of them.

He never published a science paper on the pellet experiment. The only
serious analysis I've seen is by R. McCrosky of SAO (Observations of
Simulated Meteors, Smithsonian Contributions to Astrophysics, 5, 29
(1961) which can be found at
http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1961SCoA....5...29M indicates that the
observed meteor trails were from charges A and B, which were not
self-luminous and so would only glow as they reentered the atmosphere
heading down and burning up. A's speed was measured at 14.4 km/s
(Earth-relative) while B's was in the range of 5 to 9 km/s.  McCrosky
doesn't say so explicitly, but the implication is that Zwicky's grenade
didn't work. 

We may conclude that Poulter's Charge A pellet, with a mass around 0.1
grams, was (briefly) the first artifact to reach escape speed - but not
escape velocity (i.e. it was going in the wrong direction). I really
wanted the story of Zwicky's solar orbit pellets to be true, but it
doesn't look good. Maybe McCrosky's analysis was wrong - I'm going to
check if the relevant tracking plates are in the Harvard Plate Stacks
but I doubt it, the plates from the NMSU ballistic cameras would
probably have stayed in McCrosky's possession and I expect that they no longer
exist. Without being able to check the raw data, it is reasonable to
assume McCrosky's analysis is at least roughly correct.

I conclude that Zwicky's claim is unlikely to be true and, sadly, should not be
accepted as historical fact.

There were more artificial meteor experiments in the 1960s and 1970s, with pellets
smashed down into the atmosphere at super-escape-speeds. In the 1960s the use of grenades
to create shock waves used to measure upper atmosphere temperatures and wind speeds
was common, but I don't think they would have had the energy to accelerate material
to escape speeds.

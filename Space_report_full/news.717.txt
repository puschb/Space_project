International Space Station
---------------------------

Expedition 45 is underway under the command of Scott Kelly, with
flight engineers Mikhail Kornienko, Oleg Kononenko, Sergey
Volkov, Kimiya Yui, and Kjell Lindgren.

NanoRacks/PlanetLabs Flock-2b satellite deploys continued until Oct 7.
However,  two satellites (Flock 2b-11 and 12) were not released due to a
problem with the deployer. The NRCSD-6 deployer, with the two stuck
satellites, was removed from the Kibo airlock on Oct 26 and will be
returned to Earth on a future Dragon mission.

On Oct 28 Astronauts Kelly and Lindgren made a spacewalk in suits EMU
3003 and 3010. The Quest airlock was depressurized from abotu 1200 UTC
to 1919 UTC. They removed a thermal cover from a failed MBSU unit, added
thermal covers to the AMS-02 particle physics experiment, installed
cabling for the future IDA docking adapters, and lubricated part of the
LEE-B end of the Canadarm-2. Part of the LEE lubing and the IDA wiring,
as well as the installation of a vent on Node 3, were omitted due to
lack of time.

NROL-55
-------

United Launch Alliance flew Atlas mission AV-058 from Vandenberg on Oct
8 to place two NRO satellites and a cluster of cubesats in orbit.
Hobbyists quickly tracked USA 264 and "USA 264 debris", actually thought
to be a clandestine active payload, in a 1014 x 1201 km x 63.4 deg
orbit. The satellites are understood to be NRO/Navy signals intelligence
satellites, the latest successors to the GRAB/POPPY series and probably
codenamed INTRUDER.

Following deployment of the main payloads, AV-058 made two further burns
to a 496 x 800 km x 64.8 deg orbit and deployed the cubesats from 
GRACE, the fourth NPS Cubesat Launcher flown on an Atlas Aft Bulkhead Carrier.
The cubesats are:
   Aerocube-5c and 7 from Aerospace Corporation
   The AMSAT-OSCAR-85 (Fox-1A) amateur radio satellite from AMSAT-NA
   BisonSat from Salish Kootenai College in Montana
   Alaska Research Cubesat 1 from U. Alaska Fairbanks
   Three SMDC Nanosatellite Program (SNAP-3) communications satellites for
    the US Army Strategica Missile Defence Command, named ALICE, EDDIE and JIMI
   The Low Mass Radio Science Transponder experiment from JPL
   Two PropCube ionospheric-propagation-study satellites from 
    Tyvak Nanosystems and USN Postgrad.School, named Flora and Merryweather
   Two SINOD-D satellites with software-defined radio demonstrations from SRI International.


Apstar 9
---------

Apstar 9, for Hong Kong based APT Satellite, was launched on Oct 16 from
Xichang. The satellite uses a CAST/Beijing DFH-4 bus and has C- and
Ku-band communications payloads.


Tianhui-1 03
------------

The third Tianhui-1 cartography satellite was launched on Oct 26, into 
the same local-time orbital plane as its two siblings. This was the 12th
Chinese orbital launch this year and the 9th in the past 2 months.


Turksat
-------

The second Turksat-4 satellite for Turk Telecom was launched on a Proton on Oct 16.
The 4900-kg satellite is a Mitsubishi Electric-built DS-2000 model with C, Ku and Ka-band
communications payloads; it will be located at 50 E.

GPS 73
------

Space Vehicle No 73 was added to the GPS constellation on Oct 31 when ULA's Atlas AV-060
delivered it to a 12-hour circular orbit. The satellite, model IIF flight 11, is nicknamed
'Altair'.

Cassini
--------

Cassini flew a mere 49 km from the surface of Enceladus at 1524 UTC on
Oct 28. This E-21 encounter followed an 1839 km E-20 flyby of Enceladus
at 1043 UTC on Oct 14.

Dawn
----

Dawn began its descent from the High to Low Altitude Mapping Orbits on
Oct 23. The HAMO was 1470 km from Ceres; LAMO is expected to be at 380
km altitude above the mean Ceres radius, orbiting over the world's
poles. Unfortunately the detailed orbital data for Dawn on JPL Horizons
haven't been updated for some time.

WF1190F
-------

A small object perhaps only a metre or two in size, detected by optical
telescopes of the Catalina Sky Survey in translunar orbit, has been
identified with previous observations dating back to 2009. The object
may well be an object left over from 1960s lunar missions; its frequent
close approaches to the Moon make it challenging to work the orbit
backwards and identify it with a specific mission. Following a 47000 km
lunar encounter on Jul 13, WT1190F was left in an orbit with a 680000 km
apogee and a perigee which, due to continuing lunar and solar gravity
effects, is being forced down to negative values. WT1190F is now on its
final orbit of the Earth, falling inwards from lunar distance to a
predicted Nov 13 reentry over the Indian Ocean east of Sri Lanka.

There are about 25 lost objects of this small size in translunar orbits,
including Explorer 33, Prognoz 9, Luna 4, Surveyor D-2, the Apollo 15/16/17 SIM
Bay covers, at least six Molniya Blok-L final stages from lunar-related missions,
three other small rocket stages and half a dozen despin weights. In most of these
cases there's been no tracking data on these objects since they were launched
in the 1960s and 1970s.


Errata:
-------

In JSR 716 under 'Chinese Satellites 2', I omitted the description of
the Kaituo-1 satellite from Shenzen DFH Co., which is testing electric
propulsion Hall thrusters, and its DCBB subsatellite, a 2U cubesat which
has an amateur radio payload. Under the ISS section, the vehicle
docked at Zvezda is of course Progress M-29M.

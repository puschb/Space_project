----------------------------------------------------

The launch of STS-39/Discovery is scheduled for
April 28, pending repairs to a main
engine sensor which scrubbed the Apr 23 launch attempt.

Viktor Afanas'ev and Musa Manarov continue in orbit aboard the
Mir/Kvant/Kvant-2/Kristall/Soyuz TM-11/Progress M-7 complex.  
On Apr 12 and Apr 14 the engine of Progress M-7 was used
to raise the complex orbit from 360x377 km to 370x382 km.

The second commercial Atlas I Centaur launch on Apr 18
was a failure. This was particularly unfortunate as the
payload was the GE/NHK (General Electric/ Nippon Hoso Kyokai
Japanese Broadcasting Corp) BS-3H, a replacement for
the BS-2X spacecraft which fell in the Atlantic due
to an Ariane failure, and was in turn a replacement for
BS-2 spacecraft in orbit which have been suffering equipment
failures. The Atlas was successful, but one of the two
RL-10 engines on the upper Centaur AC-70 stage failed to ignite.
This is the first Centaur failure since AC-62 in Jun 1984.
The Centaur and payload were destroyed by the range safety
officer.

A navigation satellite, probably Kosmos-2142, was launched
by Kosmos R-14 rocket on Apr 16.

10 years ago: 25 Apr 1981.  The Kosmos-1267 spaceship was launched from
Baykonur.  Kosmos-1267 consisted of two spacecraft, a prototype Salyut
module of the Kvant-2/Kristall type now docked to Mir, and a prototype
piloted spaceship with room for two cosmonauts (it was cancelled before
being used with a crew); the reusable spaceship capsule was on its
second flight, the first flight being Kosmos-929 in 1977.  The capsule
separated and was recovered after 29 days in space; the next month the
Salyut module docked with the Salyut-6 space station.  It remained
attached to the station until their combined reentry in July 1982. 

20 years ago:  24 Apr 1971 The Soyuz-10 spaceship with three
crewmembers docked with the Salyut laboratory after launch
late on Apr 22. The cosmonauts were unable to attain a tight
docking seal and had to undock and return to Earth without
opening the hatch. 

30 years ago: 25 Apr 1961. The Mercury-Atlas-3 flight was intended
as the first unpiloted orbital test flight of the Mercury spacecraft.
The Atlas exploded at only 7 km altitude. On 27 Apr, the S-15
scientific satellite reached orbit and was renamed Explorer 11.
Explorer 11 was the first gamma ray astronomy satellite, the distant
ancestor of GRO; it was not sensitive enough to detect any sources.

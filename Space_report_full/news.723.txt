International Space Station
---------------------------

Expedition 46 transitioned to Expedition 47 on Mar 2.

The Canadarm-2 unberthed the Cygnus OA-4 cargo ship, SS Deke Slayton II,
from the Unity node on Feb 19 at 1040 UTC and released it into orbit at
about 1227 UTC. The Cygnus was deorbited over the S Pacific at about
1600 UTC Feb 20.

The University of Texas BEVO-2 cubesat was apparently prematurely
ejected from the TAMU AggieSat-4 payload shortly after the latter was
deployed from ISS.

On Mar 2 at 0102 UTC Volkov, Kornienko and Kelly, aboard Soyuz TMA-18M,
undocked from the Poisk module, concluding Expedition 46. 
Tim Kopra then became commander of Expedition 47, with flight engineers
Yuriy Malenchenko and Tim Peake.

Soyuz TMA-18M made the deorbit burn at 0332 UTC and landed in Kazakhstan
at 0426 UTC. Soyuz commander Volkov had spent six months in space,
while Kornienko and Kelly completed 340d 8h 21min in space,
or about 0.93 years.

ExoMars
-------

The first ESA ExoMars mission was launched on Mar 14 aboard a Proton
from Baykonur. The main spacecraft on this mission is the ExoMars Trace
Gas Orbiter (TGO), which is intended to enter Mars orbit and study its
atmosphere. Attached to it is the Schiaparelli EDM. The EDM is the EDL
Demonstrator Module, where EDL is "Entry, Descent and Landing". EDM
consists of an aeroshell containing the EDM Surface Platform (ESP, a
triply-nested three-letter-acronym proving that ESA can compete with
NASA  in the TLA race). EDM will attempt to land on the surface as a
technology demonstration, and carries a small meteorology payload. The
TGO carries a color and stereo camera, IR and UV spectrometers, a
neutron detector, and a communications relay package to support future
surface missions.  The combined spacecraft has a mass of 4332 kg. TGO
was built by Thales/Cannes (formerly GTC/Sud Aviation) and EDM by
Thales/Torino (formerly Fiat).

At 0931 UTC Mar 14, Proton-M No. 93560 was launched from area 200 at
Baykonur into a suborbital trajectory. The Briz-M upper stage, S/N
99560,  separated at 0941 UTC and fired for 6 minutes to enter a 185 x
185 km x 51.5 deg parking orbit at 0947 UTC. After completing one orbit,
a second burn at 1110 UTC raised the orbit to 250 x 5800 km. At the next
perigee, at 1324 UTC, the orbit was raised to 696 x 21086 km and the
Briz-M additional propellant tank was jettisoned. On completing this
orbit, the fourth burn began at 1948 UTC to propel the vehicle to escape
velocity. ExoMars TGO/EDM separated from the Briz-M at 2013 UTC in a
hyperbolic Earth escape orbit (C3 = 13.78 km**2/s**2). It is scheduled
to reach Mars on Oct 19. 

The EDM is scheduled to separate from TGO three days before Mars arrival
and should enter the Martian atmosphere on a hyperbolic trajectory
towards a landing site at 6.1W 1.9S in Meridiani Planum. After entry a
parachute slows the vehicle, the back cover and forward shield are
jettisoned, and thrusters slow the ESP further. The ESP underside
consists of a crushable structure to absorb impact with the surface.

Here is the mass breakdown of the ExoMars-2016 vehicle as best
I can guess it - separate figures for the front and back shell
don't seem to be publicly available.

  Schiaparelli
    EDM Surface Platform        280 kg
    SP hydrazine                 46 kg
    Front Shield                200 kg?

  -------------------------------------

  TGO spacecraft               1365 kg  (including 41 kg separation assembly)
  TGO propellant               2367 kg

  ExoMars-2016 launch total    4332 kg

As always, corrections from those with access to better data are welcome.


Cassini
-------

Cassini made the T-115, T-116 and T-117 Titan flybys at 0222 UTC Jan 16,
0101 UTC Feb 1, and 2350 UTC Feb 16 at altitudes of 3817, 1400 and 1018
km. The encounters changed Cassini's orbit around Saturn from 94500 x
1920000 km x 1.4 deg to 307900 x 2772000 km x 22.0 deg.

SES-9
------

Falcon 9 rocket F9-022 was launched from Space Launch Complex 40 on Mar
4. The first stage flew to an apogee of around 160 km and descended 660
km downrange to crash on the droneship "Of Course I Still Love You" at
about 73.8W 28.3N,  in a technology test to develop experience for
future landing attempts. The second stage accelerated to reach a 160 x
531 km x 28.5 deg parking orbit at 2344 UTC and then reignited at 0002
UTC Mar 5 to reach a 334 x 40648 km x 28.0 deg transfer orbit. 

The SES-9 payload separated at 0006 UTC. It is a Boeing 702HP satellite
with a mass of about 5270 kg and a Ku-band communications payload for
delivery of services to Asia and the Indian Ocean from 108.2E.
By Mar 14, SES-9 was in a 28569 x 41649 km x 0.5 deg orbit.

Eutelsat 65 West A
------------------

Arianespace launched Ariane 5 vehicle L582, mission VA229 to a low inclination
geotransfer with Eutelsat do Brasil's 65 West A payload, a Loral 1300 satellite.
By Mar 14, 65 West A was in a 35729 x 35759 km x 0.0 deg near-GEO over the
Atlantic.

Eutelsat keeps renaming its satellites every time they are moved; here is an

IRNSS
-----

The Indian Regional Navigation Satellite System was augmented by launch of the 1F satellite on Mar 10.
The initial insertion orbit was 270 x 20649 km x 17.9 deg; an initial perigee burn to raise apogee
was followed by several apogee burns towards circular inclined synchronous orbit.

Here are the current orbits of the 6 satellites in the fleet.

  IRNSS 1A  35695 x 35874 km x 28.1 deg  55E
  IRNSS 1B  35711 x 35860 km x 29.9 deg  55E
  IRNSS 1C  35697 x 35873 km x  3.9 deg  83E
  IRNSS 1D  35711 x 35866 km x 29.9 deg 111E
  IRNSS 1E  35696 x 35874 km x 28.1 deg 111E
  IRNSS 1F  33349 x 35750 km x  5.3 deg En route to synchronous

Resurs-P
--------

Russia launched the third Resurs-P civil remote sensing satellite on Mar 13. The first two satellites
in the series are still operating; Resurs-P No. 1 made an orbit adjust burn on Feb 22.
The Resurs-P No. 3 spacecraft, however, failed to deploy one of its solar panels.

International Space Station
---------------------------

Expedition 47 continues with  commander Tim Kopra and flight engineers
Yuriy Malenchenko and Tim Peake. On Mar 18 Soyuz TMA-20M was launched
carrying Alexey Ovchinin, Oleg Skripochka and Jeff Williams. This is the
last of the 11F732A47 Soyuz TMA-M series, which will be replaced by the
improved Soyuz-MS variant.

On Mar 23 Cygnus cargo ship OA-6, "SS Rick Husband", was launched aboard
Atlas V flight AV-064 from Cape Canaveral. A mixture ratio problem on
the Atlas caused an 5-seconds-early first stage cutoff, which required a
full extra minute's burn on the Centaur upper stage to make the correct
orbit. After deploying Cygnus, the Centaur's second burn was intended to
deorbit the stage south of Australia, but because of insufficient
remaining propellant the engine cutoff early, and reentry occurred
downrange south of New Zealand.

SS Rick Husband arrived at the ISS on schedule, and was grappled by
the Canadarm-2 at 1051 UTC Mar 26.

Progress M-29M undocked from the Zvezda module on Mar 30 at 1415 UTC and
is performing attitude control experiments in a 373 x 401 km orbit.

Progress MS-02 was launched from Baykonur on Mar 31 and docked with
Zvezda on Apr 2 at 1758 UTC.

Dragon CRS-8 was launched on Falcon 9 F9-023 from Cape Canaveral on
Apr 8. It carries the Bigelow BEAM inflatable module experiment in its
trunk. CRS-8 is scheduled to arrive at ISS on Apr 10.

The F9-023 first stage performed boostback and reentry burns to
successfully land on the ship "Of Course I Still Love You" at 78.50W
30.50N in the Atlantic. This was the second succesful reentry and
landing of a Falcon 9 first stage, following the Dec 2015 landing of
F9-021 at Cape Canaveral.

Bars-M
------

Russia launched a Bars-M cartography satellite on Mar 26, giving it the
codename Kosmos-2515. Bars-M No. 2 joins the No. 1 satellite (Kosmos-2503)
launched in 2015.

S509356
-------

Asteroid surveys have spotted an unknown Earth satellite, provisionally
designated S509356, in a 30000 x 152000 km x 48 deg orbit. Looking
at my historical lists, it might be an object associated with the Vela
launches, although it's surprising it's only being spotted now.
The region beyond GEO is poorly tracked by satellite surveillance
systems but in recent years coverage by asteroid searchers has been
fairly good.


Tiangong 1
----------

On Mar 21 China announced the end of "data service" with the Tiangong 1 space
laboratory. The 8500 kg lab is in a 377 x 394 km x 42.8 deg orbit; it
had made reboost manuevers about twice a year, the most recent on 2015
Dec 16. Scott Tilley reported on the SeeSat list that regular radio
transmissions from the spacecraft were not received during passes
on Mar 31.


If the spacecraft is now inactive, it will reenter the atmosphere
sometime in the next few years. 

ExoMars
--------

Optical observations of the ExoMars launch have revealed several debris
objects in the vicinity of the Briz-M final stage shortly after payload
separation. Roskosmos confirms that telemetry shows the separation burns
were performed on schedule, and the stage's trajectory as measured by
astronomers puts it on course to safely miss Mars by almost one million
km. Meanwhile, ESA reports that the ExoMars TGO spacecraft itself is in
good health and on course to Mars.

Hitomi/ASTRO-H
--------------

JAXA's Hitomi satellite (the ASTRO-H X-ray observatory, not to be
confused with Tokyo University's homonymic Hitomi satellite) suffered a
major anomaly on Mar 25 while observing the quasar Markarian 205.  At
1910 UTC the satellite started tumbling and then at 0140 UTC Mar 26 the
spacecraft partly disintegrated. US tracking found eleven debris objects
in orbit. During the next scheduled pass at 0740 UTC, JAXA received only
a short burst from the radio beacon and nothing more; three more such
beacon detections were obtained up to Mar 28, when the spacecraft fell
silent (A further radio signal on Mar 29 is now thought to be spurious).
 Ground-based optical observations showed that at least two of the
debris objects, 2016-012A and 012L, were bright and tumbling several
times a minute. 2016-012A is probably the main spacecraft bus. It's
possible that 2016-012L is the extensible optical bench with the HXI
cameras, or part of the solar panels.

JAXA hopes that as the tumbling eventually slows, the spacecraft
will regain power and communications would again be possible. If
the spacecraft attitude can be fixed, it's likely that at least the
SXI CCD imagers would be able to operate. I wish my colleagues at
JAXA the best of luck in this very difficult situation.

SJ-10
-----

China's SJ-10 microgravity experiment satellite was launched on Apr 5
into low orbit. SJ-10 is based on the old FSW recoverable film-based spy
satellites. The main experiment section will separate and return to
Earth at the end of the mission.

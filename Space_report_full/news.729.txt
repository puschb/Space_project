International Space Station
---------------------------

Expedition 48 continues.

SpaceX's Dragon CRS-9 cargo ship was launched on Jul 18, carrying the
IDA-2 docking adapter and spacesuit EMU 3006. The Falcon 9 first stage
returned to Cape Canaveral for a landing at Landing Complex 1. The
second stage was deorbited south of Australia.  CRS-9 arrived at the ISS
on Jul 20; it was grappled by the SSRMS at 1056 UTC and berthed at
Harmony nadir at 1403 UTC. The IDA-2 docking adapter will be installed
on the end of the old PMA-2 Shuttle docking port to convert it for use
with the planned upgraded, astronaut-carrying Dragon.

The Progress MS-03 cargo ship was launched Jul 16 and docked with the
Pirs module at 0020 UTC Jul 19. It carried 2405 kg of cargo (including
705 kg of ISS propellant) as well as 880 kg of its own onboard propellant.

On Aug 5 the NanoRacks External Payload Platform (NREP) was extracted
from the Kibo airlock by the JEM RMS arm and installed on position EFU4
on the Kibo Exposed Facility. NREP was launched in Aug 2015 and had been
stored inside ISS for a year; it supports small external payloads.


USA 269
--------

The NROL-61 mission was launched on Atlas AV-065 from Canaveral on Jul
28 and placed the USA 269 satellite in geostationary transfer orbit. 
The satellite is thought to be an NRO (National Reconnaissance Office)
data relay communications satellite in the QUASAR series, although there
is a chance that it instead has a signals intelligence payload. The
payload made orbital maneuvers to raise its perigee, and hobbyists have
now tracked the satellite in geostationary orbit at 92 deg E over the
Indian Ocean.

Tiantong-1
----------

China launched the first Tiantong-1 satellite on Aug 5. The satellite
was built by CAST and is operated by China Satcom; it supports a mobile
communications network operated by China Telecom. The satellite
has reached geostationary orbit and is drifting east over the Indian Ocean.

Gaofen 3
--------

China's Gaofen 3 satellite is a 1-meter-resolution C-band radar imaging
satellite placed in 750 km sun-synchronous orbit. Its primary user is
the National Satellite Oceanic Applications Center in Mudanjiang. 

JCSAT-16
--------

SpaceX launched a Falcon 9 on Aug 14 carrying the JCSAT-16 satellite for
Sky Perfect JSAT, a Japanese satellite broadcasting company. The second
stage put JCSAT-16 in geostationary transfer orbit, while the first
stage completed a ballistic trajectory and landed on the droneship 'Of
Course I Still Love You' in the Atlantic. After its first orbit
raising burn, JCSAT-16 is in a 5581 x 35905 km x 10.8 deg orbit.
The Falcon 9 second stage is in an 82 x 34111 km geotransfer orbit; the
low perigee will cause it to reenter rapidly, with the apogee
decreasing by several hundred km per day.

Mozi
----

The QUESS (Quantum Experiment Scientific Satellite, liangzi kexue shiyan
weixing) was launched on Aug 15 and named 'Mozi hao' after the Chinese
philosopher Mo Zi (470-390BC), who is credited with the first mention of
a camera obscura. The Mozi satellite will perform communications
experiments using quantum entanglement.

Two small satellites were launched on the same vehicle: Lixing-1 (Drag
Star 1, also referred to as Qibo Daqi Kexue Shiyan Weixing or Upper
atmosphere scientific experimental satellite), which will study
atmospheric density after lowering its orbit to 100 to 150 km; and the
3Cat-2, a 6U cubesat from the Universita Politecnica de Catalunya in
Spain. 3Cat-2 carries the PYCARO altimeter which uses GPS signal
reflection off the Earth to measure altitude.

Mozi and Lixing were both developed by the Shanghai Engineering Center
for Microsatellites.

Chang'e-3
----------

On the Moon, the Chang'e-3 lander is reported to be still operating
after over 2.5 years. The Yutu rover entered its 33rd lunar night on Jul
28; there were reports that it had failed at that time, but research by
Emily Lakdawalla of the Planetary Society has shown that this is not
correct, and Yutu is assumed to be still viable (although not mobile).

Cassini
-------

Cassini performed the T-121 flyby of Titan at 1000 UTC Jul 25, with a
closest approach of 976 km, and the T-122 flyby at 0832 UTC Aug 10, with
a closest approach of 1599 km. The next flyby will occur on Sep 27.

CZ-7
----

The second stage from the first Chang Zheng 7 launch reentered at 0440 UTC
on Jul 28. The entry was widely observed in the Western USA on a track
from southern California to Utah.

International Space Station
---------------------------

Expedition 49 began at 2151 UTC Sep 6.

On Aug 17 at about 2315 UTC the SPDM Dextre, on the end of the Canadarm-2,
grappled the IDA-2 docking unit stored in the Dragon cargo ship's trunk.
At about 0120UTC Aug 18 SPDM unberthed the IDA-2 and by 0645 had it
positioned around 1m from the old Shuttle docking port, PMA-2.

IDA-2 fits over the end of PMA-2 to convert it from a Shuttle port to
one that can acommodate Crew Dragon and Starliner. The first docking
with IDA-2 will be an uncrewed Dragon test mission, Demo Mission 1,
which is expected in mid 2017.

On Aug 19 at 1016 UTC SPDM moved IDA-2 inward until it was just touching
PMA-2. Jeff Williams and Kate Rubins, in spacesuits EMU 3003 and 3008, 
entered the Quest airlock for US EVA-36. Quest was depressurized by 1158
UTC and its hatch was open at 1203 UTC. Williams and Rubins attached
tethers to IDA-2 and connected it loosely to PMA-2; at 1316 UTC the SPDM
released IDA-2, which was firmly mated to PMA-2 by 1440 UTC. After
removing a soft cover and carrying out some cabling work, the astronauts
were ready for other tasks when at 1731 UTC further work was cancelled
due to a communications problem in Williams' suit. The astronauts
returned to Quest, closed the hatch at 1757 UTC and repressurized the
airlock at 1802 UTC. 

On Aug 25 at about 2100 UTC the SSRMS (Canadarm-2) unberthed Dragon
CRS-9 from the Harmony module. At 1011 UTC the Dragon was released into
orbit; at 1456 UTC Dragon fired its Draco thrusters in a deorbit burn
which sent it plunging into the atmosphere at about 1520 UTC. The empty
trunk was jettisoned at 1513 UTC. Dragon splashed down off the coast of
Baja at 1547 UTC. Spacesuit EMU 3005 was returned to Earth aboard CRS-9.

On Sep 1 Williams and Rubins made a second spacewalk, US EVA-37.
The trailing thermal control radiator (TTCR) on the P6 truss segment,
held in reserve as a spare, was retracted to protect it from space debris.
A new high definition camera was installed at camera position CP9
on the P1 truss. The Quest airlock was depressurized at 1146 UTC
and repressurized at 1841 UTC.

On Sep 6 at 2151 UTC Soyuz TMA-20M undocked from the Poisk module with
Ovchinin, Skripochka and Williams. The spacecraft laded in Kazakhstan at
0113 UTC on Sep 7. Astronauts Ivanishin (CDR), Onishi (FE-5) and Rubins
(FE-6) continue aboard ISS as Expedition 49.

On Sep 14 the Nanoracks NRCSD-9 deployer was pulled from the Kibo
airlock by the Japanese RMS arm, and at 1525 UTC two Flock 2E Prime
satellites were ejected into space, with six more to come from
the same deployer. These satellites have been aboard ISS since their
delivery aboard Cygnus OA-6 back in March.

Falcon 9
--------

On Sep 1 at 1307 UTC a Falcon 9 launch vehicle exploded during
preparations for static test at Cape Canaveral's Space Launch Complex
40. The rocket was intended to launch the Israeli communications satellite
Amos-6, which was also destroyed in the accident. The explosion originated
in the vicinity of the second stage oxygen tank, but it is not yet 
clear whether the stage or ground support equipment was at fault.

OSIRIS-REx
----------

The OSIRIS-REx asteroid sample return mission was launched from Cape
Canaveral on Sep 8 by a ULA Atlas V. The model 411 vehicle, serial
AV-067, injected O-REx on a hyperbolic trajectory; the probe entered
a 0.77 x 1.17 AU heliocentric orbit on Sep 12. OSIRIS-REx has a mass of
834 kg, and carries 1230 kg of propellant and a 46 kg sample return
capsule identical to the one used by the Stardust mission.

OSIRIS-REx will make an Earth flyby in Sep 2017 which will change its
orbit to 0.90 x 1.35 AU x 6.4 deg, allowing it to rendezvous with
asteroid (101955) Bennu in Aug 2018. The spacecraft will sample the
asteroid and return to Earth in 2023.

GaoFen 10
----------

China's GaoFen 10 high resolution imaging satellite was lost in a
launch failure on Aug 31. A rumour on nasaspaceflight.com suggests
a third stage restart failure, which would have left the vehicle
just short of a marginal orbit.

Lixing-1
--------

The Lixing-1 upper atmosphere study satellite lowered its orbit on Aug 16
from 488 x 504 km to only 124 x 140 km, the lowest ever orbit
for an active spacecraft. It reentered on Aug 19.

GSSAP
-----

The USAF GSSAP 3 and 4 satellites were launched on Aug 19. The
satellites will drift in the geostationary ring making observations of
the orbits of other satellites. The US government is not releasing
the orbital data for these satellites.

IS-33/IS-36
-----------

Arianespace launched two communications satellites for Intelsat on Aug
24. IS-33e is the second Epic high throughput broadband satellite, while
IS-36 is a smaller Ku/C-band satellite for video distribution. Both
satellites will be stationed over the Indian Ocean. By Sep 15, IS-36
was over 64E and drifting, while IS-33e was slowly raising its orbit
and was in a 15756 x 35804 km transfer orbit.

Insat-3DR
---------

India successfully launched the fourth GSLV Mk II rocket from Satish Dhawan Space
Centre on Sep 8, carrying the Insat-3DR weather satellite. The cryogenic upper
stage, serial CUS-07, performed nominally. The satellite made its first
orbit raising burn on Sep 9. As well as weather sensors and data relay
payloads, Insat-3DR carries a transponder to support search and rescue (SARSAT).

Ofeq-11
-------

Israel launched the Ofeq-11 spy satellite on a Shavit rocket on Sep 14.
No orbital data are available yet but the initial orbit is probably
similar to previous missions, at about 250 x 650 km x 141 deg. The high
orbital inclination - launched almost due west - is in contrast to the
launch strategies of other countries which launch east to take advantage
of the Earth's rotation (since for Israel to launch large rockets
in the direction of their eastern neighbours might cause unfortunate
misunderstandings). It has been reported that Israeli mission controllers
are working to correct unspecified technical problems with the payload.

Erratum: Last issue had the wrong date for ROTEX-T.

On Aug 23 N Korea launched its first successful submarine launched ballistic missile (SLBM),
on a lofted trajectory with an apogee around 500 km.

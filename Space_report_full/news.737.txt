missing files on the web site. The new IP address for the planet4589.org
domain name hasn't finished propagating everywhere yet, but its synonym

International Space Station
---------------------------

Expedition 51 began with the undocking of Soyuz MS-02 from Poisk. Soyuz MS-03 is
docked at Rassvet. Progress MS-05 is docked at Pirs. 

On Mar 24 Shane Kimbrough and Thomas Pesquet, in suits EMU 3008 and
3006, completed spacewalk US EVA-40 from the Quest airlock. The airlock
was depressurized below 50 mbar at 1116 UTC and repressurized at 1758
UTC. The astronauts replaced the EXT-2 MDM computer (old S/N: MDM-16E-0102;
new S/N not known) on the S0 truss,
lubricated the LEE end-effector on the Dextre robot arm, replaced
cameras on the Kibo Exposed Facility and a light on one of the CETA
carts, and disconnected cables joining the PMA-3 docking unit to the
Tranquility node. After the EVA, PMA-3 was removed from Node 3 and
reinstalled on Node 2.

PMA-3 (Pressurized Mating Adapter 3) is one of the most-relocated and
least-used major components of the ISS. PMA-1 joins Unity to Zarya;
PMA-2, originally at the other end of Unity, now is on the end of the
Harmony module and was used for almost all Shuttle dockings. PMA-3 was
used for only two dockings, STS-97 and STS-98 in 2000-2001. It was
installed at Unity nadir on 2000 Oct 16 and the Canadarm-2 used to move
it to new locations subsequently. In its new location it will be covered
with one of the new International Docking Adapters, IDA-3, and used for
Dragon-2 and Starliner dockings.

   2000 Oct 16   Installed at Unity nadir
   2001 Mar 11   Moved to Unity port
   2007 Aug 30   Moved to Unity nadir
   2009 Aug  7   Moved to Unity port
   2010 Jan 23   Moved to Harmony zenith
   2010 Feb 16   Moved to Tranquility aft (port)
   2017 Mar 26   Moved to Harmony zenith

On Mar 30, Kimbrough and Whitson carried out spacewalk EVA-41. The Quest
airlock was depressurized at 1122 UTC and repressurized at 1833 UTC. The
astronauts, again in suits 3008 and 3006, emerged between 1136 and 1144
UTC. The old EXT-1 MDM computer, MDM-16E-0103, was removed from S0 and
replaced by a new one. Whitson removed the fabric cover from the
relocated PMA-3  docking unit, but needed Kimbrough's help to stuff it
into the cover bag needed to take it back to the airlock, which was done
by 1319 UTC. The next tasks was to install debris shields on the newly
empty axial port on Node 3. Four shields were taken from near the
airlock to Node 3 bundled in pairs. Unfortunately shield 1, being
installed by Kimbrough, came loose and floated away at about 1357 UTC;
it was cataloged in orbit as 1998-067LF (SSN 42434). After the remaining
shields were installed, the astronauts retrieved the PMA-3 cover bag
once more, unpacked the cover and pinned it down to cover the empty
quadrant. Finally, additional shields were added to the base of PMA-3 in
its new location.

On Apr 3, the Zvezda main engines were used to reboost the ISS orbit,
increasing orbital period by 1.5 seconds.

On Apr 10, Soyuz MS-02 undocked from Poisk at 0757 UTC and landed in
Kazakhstan at 1120 UTC, returing Ryzhikov, Borisenko and Kimbrough to
Earth. Peggy Whitson became ISS commander of Expedition 51.

On Apr 20, Soyuz MS-03 was launched from Baykonur and docked with the
Poisk module 6hr 4min later. Soyuz commander was Fyodor Yurchikin
and flight engineer was Jack Fischer. This was the first two-person
Soyuz mission in 14 years (Soyuz TMA-2 in Apr 2003), as Russia scales
back its ISS crew pending completion of the delayed Nauka module.

On Apr 18, Cygnus mission OA-7, the S.S. John Glenn, was launched
on ULA Atlas AV-070 from Cape Canaveral. The 7221 kg cargo ship
carries about 140 kg of small satellites for later deployment
and about 3250 kg of other cargo. OA-7 is expected to arrive
at ISS on Apr 22.


SES-10 and Falcon 9 reuse
--------------------------

On Mar 30 SpaceX launched the 5300 kg SES-10 communications satellite
into a 246 x 35673 km x 26.2 deg geotransfer orbit. After several orbit
raising burns SES-10 reached a 35775 x 35796 km x 0.1 deg geostationary
orbit at 68.5W on Apr 11. The Falcon 9 F9-033 second stage reduced its
apogee slightly, ending up in a 235 x 33407 km orbit. The first stage
was Falcon 9 core B1021, which had previously flown on the F9-023/CRS-8
mission in Apr 2016. The reused stage performed successfully and landed
for a second time  on the ASDS drone ship 'Of Course I Still Love You'
in the Atlantic.

Tianzhou
---------

China's first space station cargo resupply ship was launched on Apr 20.
Tianzhou-1 has a mass of 12910 kg. It flew on the second Chang Zheng 7
rocket, launched from Wenchang space centre on Hainan island. Tianzhou-1
will rendezvous and dock with the Tiangong-2 space lab, currently
unoccupied. This mission is mainly for technology development; the
Tianzhou frieghters will be user operationally to resupply China's
future large space station.

Tianzhou 1 was inserted into a 198 x 372 km x 42.8 deg initial orbit,
which was then raised to 311 x 369 km. The second stage ejected the
usual four motor separation covers into 200 x 550 km orbits.

SJ-13
-----

China's Shi Jian 13 was launched on Apr 12 into geotransfer orbit. The satellite is for Ka-band
high bandwidth communications experiments. After its experimental phase it will be transferred
to China Satcom which will operate it as Zhongxing-16.

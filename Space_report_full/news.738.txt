Because the original version of this issue had some Unicode characters in it,
it got processed by mail as an attachment which got stripped off by some receiving mailers.
That'll teach me to be too clever. I am therefore resending without the offending accents and 
taking the opportunity to fix one error in the launch table. For those of you who already got this twice,
my profound apologies and please discard earlier versions. - Jonathan

International Space Station
---------------------------

During May, Expedition 51 continued with Soyuz MS-03 (vehicle No. 733)
and MS-04 (vehicle No. 735)  docked at the Station. On Jun 2 with the
undocking of Soyuz MS-03 carrying Novitskiy and Pesquet, Expedition 52
began under the command of Fyodor Yurchikin, with Peggy Whitson and Jack
Fischer as flight engineers.

The SS John Glenn (Cygnus OA-7) arrived at ISS on Apr 22, with grapple
by Canadarm-2 at 1005 UTC and berthing on the Unity module at 1239 UTC.

On May 4 to 6 the SSRMS and SPDM robot arms were used to exchange the
MBSU  (Main Bus Switching Unit) No. 2 on the S0 truss with a spare
stored on ESP-2. The old MBSU was launched with S0 in 2002; the spare
was launched with ESP-2 in 2005.

On May 12 astronauts Whitson and Fischer performed spacewalk US EVA-42.
One of the two SCU (Service and Cooling Umbilicals) in the Quest airlock
developed a leak. The SCUs provide power and oxygen during spacewalk preps;
the astronauts took turns using the one working one, but that meant
less battery power was available during the actual EVA. Whitson
went onto battery power at 1222 UTC; airlock depressurizatin
began about 1230 UTC and reached 50 mbar at 1303 UTC. At 1306 UTC
the hatch was opened, and at 1308 UTC Fischer went on to battery power.
This latter event seems to be what NASA is recording as the start time of
the spacewalk. 

The astronauts went to Express Logistics Carrier 4 (ELC-4) on the S3
truss. ELC-4 was launched in Feb 2011; its ExPCA (Express Pallet
Controller Assembly, basically the pallet's computer) has failed. The
astronauts replaced it with a new ExPCA launched on OA-7 and brought the
old one back to the airlock. Also launched on OA-7 was the PMA-3 forward
shield, which they installed at the base of PMA-3. The astronauts
entered Quest and closed the hatch at 1714 UTC; Quest was repressurized
starting at 1721 UTC.

On May 23 Whitson and Fischer headed out again on EVA-43, two days after
the new MDM EXT-1 computer on the S0 truss, installed Mar 30, unexpectedly failed. The
astronauts brought out a spare computer and swapped it with the failed one.
They also installed new wireless antennas on the Destiny module.

Between May 16 and May 18, 17 cubesats were deployed from the Nanoracks
NRCSD-11 dispenser attached to the JEM RMS robot arm on Kibo. On May 24
the dispensers were swapped out in the Kibo airlock and bet ween May 25
and May 26 a further 17 cubesats were deployed from NRCSD-12.
Twenty-eight of these cubesats were part of the QB50 mission led by
Belgium's Von Karman Institute (VKI), and carry sensors (mass
spectrometer, flux probe, Langmuir probe) to study the upper atmosphere.
The cubesats deployed were:

 In addition, the US DoD/Australian DoD technology cubesat Biarri Point is reported to have been carried to the ISS
 on OA-7; it is not clear whether or not the satellite is still on ISS or was deployed clandestinely.

On Jun 2 astronauts Novitskiy and Pesquet transferred to Soyuz MS-03 and
undocked from the Rassvet module at 1047 UTC. After a deorbit burn at
1317 UTC they landed in Kazakhstan at 1410 UTC.

Launch of the Dragon CRS-11 cargo ship is currently scheduled for Jun 3.

NROL-76
-------

SpaceX carried out its first launch of an NRO payload on May 1. The
launch was codenamed NROL-76. Falcon 9 core stage B1032 took off from
Kennedy Space center's LC39A and landed at nearby Cape Canaveral's
Landing Zone 1. The second stage entered a low Earth orbit with a 51
degree inclination and deployed the USA 276 payload. The stage then
carried out a long duration coast as a technology test before being
deorbited. USA 276, which was reportedly built by Ball Aerospace, is
apparently an experimental NRO technology demonstration satellite,
possibly a followon to USA 193 whch failed a decade ago.

Hobbyist observers soon located USA 276 in a 389 x 409 km x 50.0 deg
orbit; Marco Langbroeck notes that it will pass relatively close to the ISS
in early June.


Ariane 5
--------

After delays due to social unrest in French Guiana, Arianespace on May 4
resumed launches with flight VA236 on launcher L589, placing the
Brazilian military communications satellite 'Satelite Geoestacionario
de Defesa e Comunicacoes Estrategicas 1 (SGDC) 1 (SGDC) and the Korea Telecom
satellite Koreasat-7 in geotransfer orbit. On Jun 2 SGDC was on station
at 74.4W and Koreasat 7 was on station at 114.5E.

On Jun 1 Ariane 5 vehicle 590 (flight VA237) placed Viasat-2 and
Eutelsat 172B in geotransfer orbit. Eutelsat 172B is the first
Airbus/Toulouse Eurostar 3000e satellite, using electric propulsion for
orbit raising. It carries 600 kg of xenon, saving 2500 kg of mass
compared to the earlier bipropellant chemical-propulsion model.


South Asia Satellite
--------------------

India launched a GSLV Mk II rocket on May 5 placing the GSAT-9
Ku-band communications satellite and the CUS-08 cryogenic upper stage in
geotransfer orbit. GSAT-9 has been named South Asia Satellite; India has
donated the use of one transponder each to neighbouring countries in
SAARC (South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation): Afghanistan,
Bangladesh, Bhutan, Maldives, Nepal and Sri Lanka. The remaining SAARC
country, Pakistan, refused to participate.
By May 22 GSAT-9 was on station at 97.3E.

RocketLabs
----------

RocketLabs, a California-based company with a New Zealand subsidiary,
made its first orbital launch attempt on May 25. The Electron rocket
took off from Rocket Labs Launch Complex 1 on Mahia Peninsula on North
Island, New Zealand carrying a non-separable launch vehicle
instrumentation payload. The first stage, with 9 Rutherford LOX/kero
engines, completed its burn and separated from the second stage which
ignited its single Rutherford vac engine and propelled the rocket above
the atmosphere; however, orbit was not achieved. Further details are not
yet available.

Inmarsat
--------

SpaceX launched another Falcon 9 on May 15, placing Inmarsat's broadband
communications satellite 5F4 in a supersynchronous geotransfer orbit of
385 x 70134 km x 24.5 deg. No attempt was made to recover the first
stage. By Jun 1 Inmarsat 5F4 was in a  28061 x 43518 km x 0.2 deg
elliptical synchronous orbit while the Falcon 9 second stage remained
in a 388 x 69831 km x 24.6 deg orbit.


SES-15
------

The SES-15 communications satellite was launched from French Guiana on
May 18 aboard an Arianespace Soyuz-ST-A with a Fregat-M upper stage into
geotransfer orbit. SES-15 is the fifth Boeing 702SP electric-propulsion
satellite and has a launch mass of 2302 kg. The satellite began orbit
raising on May 24 and as of Jun 2 was in a 3017 x 32594 km x 5.3 deg
orbit.

Kosmos-2518
-----------

The second EKS missile early warning satellite was launched by Russia on May 25.
It was given the cover name Kosmos-2518. The satellite is in an elliptical
Molniya orbit with a period of 12 hours; reports that the system uses
the 24-hour Tundra orbit are incorrect and apparently reflect an early
design option for the system that was not adopted.

QZSS
----

Japan's second Quasi Zenith Satellite System navigation satellite, Michibiki-2,
was launched on Jun 1. As well as a navigation signal, the payload
has a space weather monitor.


Tianzhou 1
-----------

The Tianzhou cargo ship docked with the Tiangong-2 lab at 0416 UTC Apr 22.
It carried out a refuelling test on Apr 27; another is expected in late June.

Table of Recent Suborbital Launches
-----------------------------------

North Korea launched the Hwasong-12, a one (or possibly two)-stage IRBM
(intermediate range ballistic missile), on May 13 on a high apogee
trajectory. The US claimed that the reentry vehicle fell into the sea
only 100 km from Vladivostok after a 30 minute flight, but Russia
reported it fell 500 km from Russian territory in the central part of
the Sea of Japan, after a 23 minute flight. A picture of Kim Jong Un
looking at the trajectory shows that the target was actually about 260
km from Vladivostok and 150 km from the Russian coastline.
The missile is thought to be the smaller derivative of the KN-08 (US
designation) seen in this year's North Korean military parade.

On May 30 the US Missile Defense Agency launched an ICBM-T2 target
missile from Kwajalein. The Orbital ATK missile has a new 2-meter
diameter first stage, possibly a recycled Trident C-4 first stage; the
upper stages are thought to be the Orion 50SXLT and the Orion 50. A
GBI-OBV missile with a CE-II `kill vehicle' was launched from Vandenberg
to intercept it. The MDA claims that the intercept was successful.

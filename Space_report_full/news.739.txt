International Space Station
---------------------------

Expedition 52 continues with commander Fyodor Yurchikin and flight
engineers Peggy Whitson and Jack Fischer.

The Dragon CRS-11 cargo ship was launched on Jun 3 and arrived at the
ISS on Jun 5. It was grappled by the Canadarm-2 at 1352 UTC and berthed
on the Harmony module at about 1610 UTC.

In the CRS-11 trunk there are three experiments: the NICER X-ray
astronomy payload, the ROSA flexible solar array, and a facility to
support future Earth observing experiments called MUSES. Inside the
Dragon are supplies, experiments, and the J-SSOD#7 cubesat deployer with
five 1U cubesats.

The Cygnus OA-7 cargo ship, SS John Glenn, was unberthed from the Unity
module at 1105 UTC Jun 4 and released at 1310 UTC into orbit.
On Jun 8 four SpireGlobal Lemur-2 satellites were ejected from the Nanoracks
NRCSD-E deployer on the service module; the ejections were at 1753 UTC and
2103 UTC. OA-7 was deorbited on Jun 11, entering the atmosphere over
the South Pacific at 1702 UTC.

Australian sources have reported that the AFRL/DSTO Biarri Point cubesat
was clandestinely deployed from the ISS on May 18. If this is true, it
has not been assigned a public catalog number in the US satellite
catalog.

On Jun 3 the classified USA-276 spacecraft (launched by Falcon 9 on May
1) passed within 10 kilometers of the ISS. No public announcement of
this close encounter was made, and it is unclear whether or not the US
government alerted the other ISS partners of the close pass.

On Jun 7-8 MUSES was moved from the Dragon trunk to ELC-4.
The transfer of NICER from the Dragon trunk to ELC-2 Site 7 began on Jun
11, and took several days with stops to restore NICER power to prevent
it getting too cold. By Jun 14 it was at ELC-2. 

Progress MS-06 was launched on Jun 14 carrying 2400 kg of supplies
and four small satellites for later EVA deployment. It docked with
the Zvezda module on Jun 16 at 1137 UTC.

The ROSA solar array was unberthed from Dragon's trunk on Jun 17
and was deployed on the end of the SPDM/SSRMS. It remained deployed
until Jun 26, and was extended and retracted several times. The
final retraction was unsuccessful and ROSA was jettisoned into orbit
at 2115 UTC Jun 26.

Dragon was unberthed from the ISS at about 1800 UTC Jul 2 and is
scheduled to be released early on Jul 3.

SJ-18
-----

The 7600 kg Shi Jian 18 communications satellite was lost on Jul 2 when
the second Chang Zheng 5 rocket failed to reach orbit. Problems during
first stage burn made the rocket lose altitude from an apogee of around
170 km, and an apparently successful but truncated second stage burn was
unable to prevent the vehicle falling back into the atmosphere.


GSLV-3
------

The first orbital launch of ISRO's GSLV Mk 3 launch vehicle was a success.
GSLV Mk 3-D1 took off from Satish Dhawan Space Centre on Sriharikota Island
on Jun 5. The design of the rocket is broadly similar to the Ariane 5, with
two strapon boosters, a core stage, and an upper stage wich performs
direct insertion to geotransfer orbit without first entering a parking orbit.
The payload was the 3136 kg GSAT-19 communications satellite.

Proton
------

After a year's gap, the Proton rocket is flying again. Echostar 21 was launched
on Jun 8. The 6900 kg Loral LS-1300 satellite, with an 18-metre deployable
dish antenna, provides S-band mobile communications for Echostar Mobile.

HXMT
----

The long-awaited first Chinese astronomical satellite flew on Jun 15. The Hard
X-ray Modulation Telescope, named Huiyan after launch, was placed in orbit
with three small satellites. Milanesat is the third Nusat/Aleph-1 imaging
payload from the Uruguayan/Argentine firm Satellogic. OVS-1A and OVS-1B
are 50 kg imaging satellites from Zhuhai Orbital Control Engineering Ltd.

ZX-9A 
----- 

The China Satcom ZX-9A (Zhongxing-9A, Chinasat-9A, also known as
Xinnuo-4, Chinastar-4) broadcasting satellite payload was launched on
Jun 18 according to chinaspaceflight.com. The CZ-3B third stage reached
parking orbit on its first burn and reignited as it crossed the equator
to put the vehicle in geotransfer; however the second burn was
incomplete and left the payload in an elliptical orbit with much lower
apogee than planned. For statistical purposes (see JSR669) I score this
launch with a weight of 0.40 (reached an orbit but not a usable one);
however, the payload probably does have enough fuel to reach GEO, albeit
with a much reduced operational lifetime. At of Jul 2, there had been
no new orbital data for ZX-9A since Jun 19; probably it has raised its
orbit but not yet been re-identified by US sensors.

PSLV-C38
--------

The Cartosat 2E satellite was orbited by India's PSLV on Jun 23,
together with 31 small secondary payloads. These included cubesat
payloads for Finland, Slovakia and Austria and a small Latvian payload,
Venta-1. The Italian amateur X-ray astronomy satellite Max Valier
carries the MPE/Garching MicroROSI X-ray telescope. The VZLUSat cubesat
from the Czech Republic also carries an X-ray astronomy experiment with
a `lobster-eye' hard X-ray optic. Mike Rupprecht (DK3WN) at dk3wn.info
is doing great work identifying which cubesat has which catalog number.

The PSLV-C38 fourth stage (PS4) made a series of test burns in
preparation for future launches to deploy secondary payloads in multiple
orbits. After reaching an initial 510 x 518 km x 97.5 deg orbit at 0414
UTC and deploying the payloads, PS4 made a second burn at about 0457 UTC
to 350 x 505  km x 97.5 deg; a third burn at about 0543 UTC to 334 x 348
km x 96.9 deg; and a fourth burn to change inclination at about 1830 UTC
to 336 x 370 km x 94.6 deg.


Napryazhenie
------------

On Jun 23 Russia launched a Defense Ministry satellite codenamed
Kosmos-2519 into a 650 km polar orbit. It is believed that 
the satellite's real name is Napryazhenie No. 1,  and is probably built by the
Lavochkin company. It may be carrying a geodetic payload and a space
surveillance (space debris monitoring) payload.

Bulgariasat and Iridium
-----------------------

East and West coast Falcon 9 launches on Jun 23 and 25 successfully
put their payloads in orbit and saw the landing of their first stages
on droneships. On Jun 23 Bulgariasat went to supersynchronous transfer
orbit, and first stage B1029, on its second flight, landed on
the Of Course I Still Love You. On Jun 25 ten Iridium communications
satellites entered 625 km parking orbits and first stage B1036,
on its first flight, landed on Just Read The Instructions.
On Jul 2 launch of a further Falcon 9, with the Intelsat IS-35e satellite,
was called off 10 seconds before ignition.


AMC-9
-----

The AMC-9 satellite has failed in geostationary orbit. AMC 9, a Thales
Alenia Spacebus 3000B3 model with a launch mass of 4100 kg, belongs to
SES World Skies (formerly to SES Americom; AMC 9 is short for
Americom-9). At about 0727 UTC on 2017 Jun 17, an event occurred to the
satellite which made a significant change to its orbit. I estimate the
prograde component of the velocity change was about 0.45m/s, causing its
orbital period to increase and the satellite to drift off its 83.0W station at
about 0.17 degree/day west. A larger in-plane nadir velocity change of
about 13m/s increased the satellite's orbital eccentricity. On Jul 1,
with AMC 9 drifting over 84.6W, SES reestablished contact with the satellite.
On Jul 2, it was revealed that several debris objects had been observed
in the vicinity of the satellite, suggesting partial disintegration of
the spacecraft.

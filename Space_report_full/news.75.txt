----------------------------------------------------

Launch of STS-40/Columbia occurred on June 5 at 13:24:51 UT approximately.
Crew are Bryan O'Connor, Sid Gutierrez, Dr. Rhea Seddon, Dr. Jim Bagian,
Dr. Tamara Jernigan, Dr. Mille Hughes-Fulford, Dr Andrew Gaffney, several
rats, and  many jellyfish.

Soyuz TM-11 undocked from the Mir complex and landed on May 26.  Aboard
were the long stay crew Viktor Afanas'ev and Musa Manarov, and Soyuz
TM-12 researcher Helen Sharman of England.  The
Mir/Kvant/Kvant-2/Kristall/Soyuz TM-12 complex is now crewed by Anatoliy
Artsebarksiy and Sergey Krikalyov.  The Progress M-8 cargo craft
carrying supplies and fuel for the station was launched from Baykonur on
May 30.  Musa Manarov landed with 540 days 22 hours and 31 minutes
spaceflight time accrued over two missions to Mir, beating Yuriy
Romanenko's record for cumulative spaceflight time by over 100 days, and
the US record by over a factor of six. 

The 10th Resurs-F remote sensing satellite was launched on May 21 from
Plesetsk. It carries an MK4 multispectral camera, and is based on the 
Vostok spacecraft.

Kosmos-2149 was launched on May 24 from Plesetsk. It is an imaging recon
satellite and will remain in orbit for 2 months. It replaced Kosmos-2138
which was deorbited on May 24 after 59 days in space.

Aurora 2, a communications satellite for GE Alascom, was launched
by a Delta 7925 on May 29. The GE 3000 class C-band comsat will replace
the Aurora 1 which was launched in 1982.

TIP 2, a US Navy experimental navigation satellite, reentered on May 26.
It was launched in 1975. Kosmos-151, an electronic intelligence
satellite launched in 1967, reentered on May 6.

Delta 111, the second stage of the launch vehicle which orbited Nimbus 6
in 1975, exploded into hundreds of fragments about May 14. The Delta
stages of that era had a habit of exploding years after launch, due
to the detonation of left over propellants. More recent Delta launches
have burned up all their propellants to avoid this problem.

-----------------------------------


10 years ago: 31 May 1981. The Indian Space Research Organization launched
Rohini RS-D-1, a remote sensing satellite. Problems with the launch vehicle
left the satellite in a low orbit from which it reentered in one week.

20 years ago: 30 May 1971. Mariner 9 was launched on its way to orbit Mars
and map its surface. Mariner 8 failed earlier in the month.

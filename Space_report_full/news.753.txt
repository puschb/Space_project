International Space Station
---------------------------

Expedition 56 continues with astronauts Feustel, Artem'ev, Arnold, Prokop'ev,
Aunon-Chancellor and Gerst.

The Progress MS-08 cargo ship undocked from the Zvezda module at 0216 UTC on Aug 23.
It carried out experiments independently for a week. At about 0530 UTC Aug 23
it lowered its orbit to 346 x 402 km; it was deorbited over the South Pacific 
at 0207 UTC Aug 30.

On Aug 28 the Canadarm-2/Dextre robot arms moved the DESIS atmospheric
research instrument from the Kibo airlock and installed it on the MUSES
Earth-observing platform on the JEM Exposed Facility. DESIS was launched
on Dragon CRS-15.

At 2300 UTC Aug 29 a drop in ISS air pressure was detected. By 1400 UTC
Aug 30 the crew had located the leak coming from a hole in the BO
(`orbital module') of the Soyuz MS-09 ferry ship. The 2mm hole was
hidden behind a panel in the module. Photos of the hole suggest that it
is not an orbital debris strike - it appears to have been drilled into
the BO's pressure shell. Presumably the hole was drilled during
manufacture, either in error or to hold an internal or external fixture
that has since come free. In this hypothesis the hole may have been
plugged with something that prevented the leak appearing after launch on
June 6, but that something since came free creating a leak path to the
outside. (These ideas are based on discussion on nasaspaceflight.com
and elsewhere; we'll have to wait for an official analysis from
Roskosmos - probably months from now - to get the full story.) By 1630
UTC the Russian crew had plugged the leak with sealant and Kapton tape.

On Sep 6 at 0050 UTC the Zvezda module fired its engines to reboost
the station's orbit slightly, increasing its velocity by 0.2m/s.

On Sep 6 to Sep 14 the Japanese HDTV-EF2 camera, launched on HTV-6 and
installed in Feb 2017, was removed from the Exposed Facility and swapped
out with a new HDTV-EF2. Unfortunately the  replacement package did not
activate correctly. I don't know which cargo mission brought up the new
HDTV-EF2 - let me know if you do.


Aeolus
------

The European Space Agency's Aeolus satellite was launched to
sun-synchronous orbit by Vega flight VV12 on Aug 22. Aeolus carries an
1-metre telescope with an ultraviolet laser radar (lidar) to study wind
velocities at different altitudes in the atmosphere.

Beidou 35/36
------------

China launched two more Beidou-3 navigation satellites on Aug 24. The
satellites, built by the Shanghai microsatellite center, are vehicles
M11 and M12 for medium Earth orbit.

HY-1C
-----

HY-1C, launched by China on Sep 7, is an oceanographic satellite. It
carries an ocean color imager, a multispectral imager for study of
coastal zones, an ultraviolet imager, and a ship-tracking AIS payload.

Telstar 18 Vantage
------------------

Telesat Canada has another massive (7070 kg launch mass) C/Ku-band
Maxar/SSL-1300 communications satellite in orbit: Telstar 18 Vantage.
Much of the mass is propellant which will be used to reach GEO following
is launch to an 18000 km apogee subsynchronous transfer orbit by a Block
5 Falcon 9, repeating the mission profile of Telstar 19 Vantage in July.

APT (Asia Pacific Telecom) has leased some of the capacity on the
satellite, and refers to the satellite as Apstar 5C. Since APT doesn't
actually own the satellite, I regard this as a marketing name only.

The Falcon 9 first stage, B1049, landed safely on the droneship 'Of
Course I Still Love You'. The second stage remains in transfer orbit.
Telstar 18V made its first apogee raising burn at 0800 UTC Sep 11, to
292 x 20475 km x 27 deg. By Sep 18 the orbit was 12083 x 35752 km x 7.3 deg.

ICESAT-2
--------

NASA-Goddard's long-delayed ICESAT-2 was launched in September aboard
the final Delta 2 rocket, flight Delta 381. ICESAT-2 carries the ATLAS
instrument, a visible-light laser with a 0.8m aperture telescope. The
spacecraft is an Orbital (now Northrop Grumman) Leostar-3. ICESAT-2 wll
measure the thickness of the polar ice sheets.

The Delta second stage delivered ICESAT-2 to a 92 degree orbit and then
made a small burn to change inclination to 93 degrees before ejecting
four university-developed cubesats. ELFIN and ELFIN-STAR (or ELFIN-B)
from UCLA are studying relativistic electrons in the radiation belts.
DAVE (CP7) from Cal Poly is studying a new damper technology for deploying
booms gently. A final cubesat from the University of Central Florida 
studies surface charging; unfortunately its name, Surfsat, is identical
to that of a small 1995 satellite which is still in orbit.

The Delta 381 second stage performed a deorbit burn and impacted the 
ocean around 1512 UTC.

Delta 381 was the 724th and last launch of a rocket using a first stage
based on the 1957-era Thor missile. 155 of these were Delta II vehicles,
with the Extra Extended Long Tank Thor first stage - the Delta II class
had a remarkable 99.1% launch success rate by my scoring criteria.


Surrey Imaging Satellites
--------------------------

India launched a PSLV Core-Alone variant on Sep 16 carrying two
commercial payloads built by Surrey Satellite Technology. NovaSar-S is a
445 kg experimental imaging radar satellite; it carries a 3m x 1m S-band
(3 GHz) radar and a xenon ion propulsion system. The S1-4 satellite uses
the same design as the earlier DMC3 imaging constellation and will
supplement it; they operate in almost the same orbital plane. The data
from the constellation is used by the Beijing-based company 21AT.


RemoveDebris
------------

It's been a busy time at Surrey Satellite and Surrey Space. Surrey's
RemoveDebris satellite began active operations in September. On Sep 16
at 2306 UTC the satellite ejected a 2U cubesat, DebrisSat-1.
RemoveDebris then fired a net at the tumbling satellite; the net wrapped
around DebrisSat, increasing its drag coefficient - which will
accelerate its reentry.


Kosmos-2519/2521/2523: Addendum
---------------------

I forgot to include in last issue's analysis the total manuever
capability demonstrated by the three satellites:

 Kosmos-2519  125 m/s
 Kosmos-2521  204 m/s
 Kosmos-2523   27 m/s

I should also have noted that Phillip Clark has presented his own
excellent analysis of the mission in an article in Spaceflight magazine
(vol 60, p 30, June 2018) and I understand that a sequel is in the
works.   


Helios Wire
------------

Two Astro Digital-built 6U cubesats lost in the Nov 2017 Soyuz launch
failure referred to in JSR 743 as Corvus BC 3 and 4 were actually Corvus
BC-C and Helios Wire BIU. Helios Wire BIU was a payload intended for
Vancouver-based Helios Wire, which plans to deploy a constellation of
data relay satellites.

Hayabusa-2
----------

Hayabusa-2 made its first `touchdown rehearsal', TD1-R1 on Sep 11-12,
approaching the asteroid to within 0.6 km before retreating, rather than
the planned 0.04 km. Release of the MINERVA-II-1 lander was planned for
Sep 21, but I'm guessing this will be delayed while the team work out
how to operate more reliably close to Ryugu's surface.

Table of Recent Suborbital Launches
-----------------------------------

The suborbital launches table includes known flights above 80 km.
The Chinese private company iSpace flew a modified short range missile to about 100 km on Sep 5,
releasing three 1U cubesats on its suborbital trajectory. Despite being `cubesats' by design,
they are not `satellites' since they did not, and were not intended to, reach orbit.

----------------------------------------------------

Columbia landed at 1539UT on Jun 14, on runway 22 at Edwards AFB.
This completed the STS-40 Spacelab Life Sciences
1 mission.  Atlantis is being processed for the STS-43 mission which
will deploy another Tracking and Data Relay Satellite; this will be
followed by Discovery's STS-48 mission to launch the Upper Atmosphere
Research Satellite.  After the current mission, Columbia will undergo
modification for extended duration flights, its next mission being
another Spacelab flight about a year from now. This week Columbia
recaptured the 'Orbiter with most flight hours' record from Discovery,
with a total of 1804 hours 23 minutes in its 11 flights.

Anatoliy Artsebarksiy and Sergey Krikalyov continue in orbit
aboard the Mir/Kvant/Kvant-2/Kristall/Soyuz TM-12/Progress M-8 complex.

An Okean oceanographic remote sensing satellite built by NPO Yuzhnoye was
launched on Jun 4 by Tsiklon from Plesetsk.

Correction: the date of the Delta 111 explosion was May 1,
according to calculations by Mike McCants. Also, the deployment
of the classified USA-70 satellite, international designation
1991-31C, from the STS-39 mission is now confirmed.

10 years ago: 4 Jun 1981. The Kosmos-1275 navigation satellite was launched.
On 1981 Jul 24 it disintegrated into many pieces, possibly as a result of colliding 
with another space object.

20 years ago: 6 Jun 1971. The first space station mission, with cosmonauts
Georgiy Dobrovol'skiy, Vladislav Volkov and Viktor Patsaev launched in
Soyuz-11 to dock with the Salyut space lab and spend 22 days aboard.
Just prior to reentry on 29 June, a valve on the Soyuz-11 accidentally failed
open venting the cabin air and causing the deaths of all three crew members.

20 years ago: 15 Jun 1971. The first KH-9 HEXAGON ("Big Bird") spy satellite
was launched. The Big Bird has now been superseded by the Advanced Crystal
and Lacrosse recon satellites.

30 years ago: 8 Jun 1961. The Discoverer 24 spy satellite failed to reach orbit 
when its Agena engine did not ignite. Discoverer 25 completed a succesful mission
Jun 16-19.

International Space Station
---------------------------

Soyuz MS-12 was launched on Mar 14 carrying Aleksey Ovchinin, Nick Hague and Christina
Koch. It docked with the Rassvet module at 0101:43 UTC Mar 15, beginning ISS Expedition 59.

Progress MS-10 made a 0.7m/s burn to adjust the ISS orbit at 1422 UTC Mar 23.

The new Li-ion batteries delivered by HTV-7 last September on the External Pallet EP7 are finally being installed
in a mixture of robotic (SSRMS/Dextre SPDM) operations and manual work on spacewalks.
EP7 is stored on the POA location on the Mobile Base System.

Here is the chronology of activities (most of you will want to skip this bit!)
  Mar 19       SPDM move NiH battery 0070 from P4 truss IEA 4A slot 3 to Dextre's EOTP3 stowage point.
               SPDM move NiH battery 0073 from P4 4A slot 1 to EP7 slot X for disposal
               SPDM move Li-ion battery 0006 from EP7 slot C to P4 4A slot 3
                      Unfortunately this battery failed on Mar 22.
  Mar 20       SPDM move NiH battery 0074 from P4 4A slot 5 to EP7 slot Z for disposal
               SPDM move NiH battery 0069 from P4 4A slot 6 to EP7 slot Y for disposal
               SPDM move Li-ion battery 0010 from EP7 slot B to P4 4A slot 5
               SPDM move Li-ion battery 0008 from EP7 slot A to P4 4A slot 1

                SPDM move NiH battery 0068 from SPDM arm 2? to EP7 slot E?
   I believe NiH battery 0070 is still on the SPDM EOTP.
   But I haven't seen any confirmation of this.

   On Apr 2, the spare BCDU (Battery Charge/Discharge Unit) which was
   launched as part of ELC-1's initial cargo in 2009
   was moved from ELC-1 to replace P4 IEA's 4A3 BCDU which is thought to have failed.
   On Apr 3, the new-but-failed Li-Ion battery 0006 was removed from P4 4A3 and returned
   to the EP7, possibly on slot F?

 With these changes, and a few more still to come, the 2A and 4A solar arrays on the
P4 truss are back in action using the new batteries.

The Progress MS-11 cargo ship was launched on Apr 4 and docked with the Pirs module
only 3h20 min after launch.


S5
--

The US Air Force Research Lab's S5 satellite appears to have separated from its
Nusantara Satu host satellite at about 1800 UTC on Mar 4. Part of the Beresheet probe's
adapter structure was jettisoned in the `GEO graveyard' first to allow S5 to emerge.

Orbits of the three GEO objects on Mar 8 were:
 44048  Nusantara Satu             35779 x 35791 km x 0.1 deg  GEO 145.9E
 44065  S5                         36053 x 36055 km x 0.1 deg  GEO 139.3E+3.3deg W/day
 44066  Beresheet adapter          36131 x 36170 km x 0.1 deg  GEO 133.2E+4.6deg W/day

ZX-6C
------

China launched the Zhongxing-6C satellite from Xichang on Mar 9. ZX-6C is a C-band
communications satellite using the DFH-4 bus. By Mar 19 the satellite was
on station in GEO at 129.9E.

WGS-10
------

The US Air Force communications satellite Wideband Global Satcom 10 was launched
on Mar 16 by a Delta 4 Medium from Cape Canaveral into a supersynchronous transfer
orbit. The Boeing-built spacecraft carries X- and Ka-band communications payloads
and has both bipropellant and electric propulsion systems. 
  The orbital data for WGS satellites were declassified last year; it's nice to
see public TLE data flowing for the new satellite. By Mar 22 it was in
a 13246 x 45069 km x 5.3 deg orbit.

PRISMA
------

The Italian Space Agency's PRISMA imaging satellite was launched by an
Arianespace Vega on Mar 22. Its 0.21m aperture telescope has a
hyperspectral detector with high spectral resolution near infrared and
visible imaging.

Beresheet
---------

The SpaceIL Beresheet probe (I'm told "B'reshit" is a better
transliteration from the Hebrew) has made a further orbit raising burn
for translunar injection. The 60 second perigee burn at 1230 UTC Mar 19
raised apogee beyond the Moon to 405 000 km. It entered  an estimated
400 x 10000 km lunar orbit on Apr 4, with a 324m/s burn starting at 1418
UTC and lasting 350s.

Kicksat-2
---------

The Kicksat-2 cubesat, developed by Zac Manchester (Stanford U.) and
funded on Kickstarter, deployed at least some of its circa 104 Sprite
chipsats on Mar 19 at 0340 UTC, as the satellite orbited over the
eastern Pacific southwest of California. Cees Bassa detected radio
signals from some of the Sprites. There are no US satellite catalog
entries for them. Their area-to-mass ratio is rather high, so they are
strongly affected by drag, and Manchester reports that they are expected
to have reentered within a few days.


Microsat-R
----------

On Mar 27 India's Defense Research Development Organization (DRDO) launched the first PDV Mk II
antisatellite interceptor from Kalam Island. After a three minute flight the missile collided
with the 740 kg Microsat-R satellite in LEO. Microsat-R was in a 260 x 282 km x 96.6 deg orbit
at the time, travelling north over the Bay of Bengal; PDV-II flew south from Orissa to intercept
it. PDV-II is reported to be a three stage vehicle - two solid boost stages and a kill vehicle
with liquid-propellant terminal guidance thrusters.

As of Mar 31 US authorities were reporting over 250 debris pieces detected. On Apr 5, 57 of them
were publicly cataloged, 13 showing apogees over 1000 km.

PSLV-C45
--------

India launched PSLV-C45 from Sriharikota on Apr 1. This was the first launch of
the PSLV-QL variant which has 4 strapon boosters, and the first time the PS4
upper stage carried solar panels to support long-term in-orbit attached payloads.

The main payload was EMISAT, a signals intelligence satellite for the Indian
defense research agency DRDO. 

Cubesats on PSLV-C45 include: BlueWalker 1, a test IoT data relay
satellite for Avellan Space Technology and Science of Midland, Texas
built by NanoAvionics of Vilnius, whose own test satellite, M6P, is also
aboard; Astrocast 0.2 is another IoT test satellite for Astrocast of
Lausanne.  Danu Pathfinder 1 is the third in the AISTECHSAT series of
ship tracking  satellites from AistechSpace of Barcelona. Four Lemur-2
satellites for SpireGlobal are aboard, and twenty Planet cubesats
in the improved Flock 4 series.

Preliminary data suggest that (1) the final burn of the PS4 stage
may have been retrograde instead of posigrade, leading to an elliptical
rather than circular final orbit and (2) two of the satellite deployments
inadvertently occured only after this burn, leaving them in the PS4's
orbit rather than the higher target one. 


R3D2
----

RocketLab launched the fifth Electron on Mar 28, carrying the DARPA R3D2
 (Radio-frequency Risk Reduction Deployment Demonstration) satellite.
R3D2 is a  150 kg Northrop Grumman satellite with a 2.3m diameter
deployable lightweight antenna.

TL2-01
------

China launched the first of its second-generation tracking and data relay satellites on Mar 31.
Tianlian-2 sat 01  (Tianlian erhao 01 xing) is a CAST DFH-4. The TL2 series will replace the four
TL1 sats already in orbit:

    Satellite             Launch date    Current GEO Location           Location History
    Tianlian-1 01 xing    2008 Apr 25    Indian O. Backup   80E          77E (2008-2013); 80E (2013-2019)

                                                                        171E (2016) 177E (2016-Jan 2019) 167E (2019)
    Tianlian-1 03 xing    2012 Jul 25    Africa             17E          17E (2012-2016); 20E (2016); 10.5E (2016-Jan 2019); 17E (2019)
    Tianlian-1 04 xing    2016 Nov 22    Indian Ocean       77E          77E (2016-2019)
    Tianlian-2 01 xing    2019 Mar 31     TBD

As of Apr 6, geotransfer orbit TLEs for TL2-01 had stopped on Apr 1; this suggests it made an
apogee maneuver on that date but has not yet been located by US tracking in GEO. TL2-01's
apogee at 0800 UTC Apr 1 was at around 114E. 


O3B
----

The final four satellites in the first-generation SES O3b constellation were launched
from French Guiana on Apr 4 on a Soyuz/Fregat to medium equatorial Earth orbit. The O3b satellites
provide broadband internet to developing countries.

Hayabusa-2
-----------

At 0400 UTC on Apr 4 Haybusa 2 began another descent from its 20 km home
point towards the surface of Ryugu. At an altitude of 500m, at 0156 UTC
Apr 5, it ejected the SCI (Small Carry-On Impactor), a 14 kg vehicle
with a 5 kg explosive shaped charge and a 2 kg copper mass. Hayabusa-2
then performed an avoidance burn to head off several km to the side of
the asteroid, over the horizon from the SCI location. Early in this
retreat, at 0214 UTC, it ejected the DCAM-3 camera package. At 0236 UTC
the SCI detonated, propelling the copper payload into the asteroid with
the intention of creating a new crater. DCAM-3 imaged this operation and
relayed the data to the main spacecraft. Hayabusa-2 will image Ryugu
from a safe distance and search for the resulting crater, before
returning to its 20 km home point on around Apr 20. The plan is to then
make a further descent to sample the freshly exposed material in the new
crater.


Erratum
-------
In JSR 760 I said that Progress MS-10 did a reboost on Dec 2; this should have read Dec 27
(with further reboosts Jan 18 and Feb 26).

International Space Station
---------------------------

Correction to previous description of battery work: the new-but-failed battery
that was removed on Apr 3 was the one in channel 4A3 slot 5, not the one in slot 3.
On Apr 5 the SPDM moved NiH battery 0072 from AP005 on P4 IEA 4A slot 6 to slot 5.

On Apr 8 McClain and St-Jacques performed spacewalk EVA 54. The airlock was
depressurized by about 1125 UTC with hatch open at 1126 and the suits on battery
power at 1131. At  1229 the adapter plate removed from 4A slot 6 and placed on
top of the plate in slot 2 at 1240 UTC. This opens up slot 6 for one of the old
batteries. 

The spacewalkers then carried out cabling to provide external wireless support and
backup power to Canadarm-2. The airlock was repressurized at 1800 UTC.

On Apr 11 the SPDM moved NiH battery 0069 from EP7 slot Y to the newly empty
slot 6 on P4 4A. Then, battery 0070 was moved from the Dextre EOTP to slot Y.

So the 4A side has the following right now:
     Slot 1  Li-ion 15?        Slot 2  Adapter 07 + Adapter 05
     Slot 3  Li-ion 17?        Slot 4  Adapter 06 + NiH 0071
     Slot 5  NiH 0072          Slot 6  NiH 0069

On Apr 17 the 10th Antares rocket took off from the Mid-Atlantic
Regional Spaceport at Wallops Island, placing Cygnus NG-11 (the S.S.
Roger Chaffee) in low orbit at 2053 UTC and separating from the payload
at 2055 UTC. The Chaffee reached the ISS on Apr 19, with SSRMS
grapple at 0928 UTC and berthing on Unity nadir at about 1130 UTC.

The NG-11 mission carries a large number of nanosatellites hosted on a
variety of dispenser systems.

Four Planetary Systems Corp. CSD 3U deployers were attached to the
Antares second stage, and ejected their payloads, SASSI2 and 12
ThinSats, at 2059 UTC Apr 17.  Unusually, the payloads were not
cataloged by US space tracking, and were expected to have reentered by
around Apr 24.


SASSI-2 (Student Aerothermal Spectrometer Satellite of Illinois and Indiana,
correctly written as SASSI-superscript-2) is a 3U cubesat from the University
of Illinois to study the diffuse bow shock of a satellite in low orbit.

The ThinSats are a new design from NearSpaceLaunch for the Virginia Commercial
Space Flight Authority and carry student experiments. Twelve Thinsats were
deployed. Each is made of a number of Thinsat cases 0.01 x 0.11 x 0.11m in size
connected by solar panel ribbons 0.30m long 0.05m wide. The satellites are
launched folded up and deploy after ejection in an accordion-like fashion.
The twelve satellites include:
 Three Thinsat 3T (1B,1G,1K), consisting of three Thinsat cases connected by two ribbons.
 Overall mass 1 kg, size 0.01 x 0.1 x 1.3m.  

 Six Thinsat 6T (1C,1D,1F,1H,1J,1L), consisting of six Thinsat cases connect by five ribbons.
 Overall mass 2 kg, size 0.01 x 0.1 x 2.7m

 Three Thinsat D+4T (1A, 1E, 1I), consisting of five Thinsat cases (one of them a double-width
 0.03 x 0.11 x 0.11m case) connected by 4 ribbons. Overall mass 2 kg, size (0.01-0.03) x 0.1 x 2.2m.  

The JAXA J-SSOD No. 11 dispenser will be delivered to the Kibo module for later deployment.
It contains three 1U cubesats developed by Kyushu Tech students:
 Uguisu, for Kyushu Tech
 Raavana-1, for the Arthur C. Clarke Institute for Modern Technologies, Moratuwa, Sri Lanka;
 Nepalisat-1, for the Nepal Academy of Space Technology, Kathmandu.

The Nanoracks NRCSD-16 payload will also be delivered to the Kibo module for later deployment.
It includes:
  Aeternitas (1U, Old Dominion University, Virginia);
  Libertas (1U, University of Virginia);
  Ceres  (1U, Virginia Polytechnic);
  KRAKsat (1U, Kraksat team and Akademia Gorniczo-Hutnicza, Krakow, Poland) with
   a ferrofluid attitude control system experiment.
  Swiatowid (2U, SatRevolution, Wroclaw, Poland), with a 4m res Earth imager.
  IOD-1 GEMS, Orbital Microsystems (Boulder, Colorado and Harwell, UK; 3U from ClydeSpace),
   with a passive microwave weather sensor.
  EntrySat (2U from Institut superieur de l'aeronautique et de l'espace, Toulouse), to study
   the atmospheric reentry environment.

The Nanoracks NRCSD-E mission 7 is attached to the Chaffee's service module.
Its payloads are:
  Aerocube-10a, a 1.5U cubesat from the Aerospace Corp containing
  29 small subsatellites (AC-10a Probe 01 to 29), each 0.016 kg and 0.1m in diameter,
  which will be ejected to serve as radar targets to study atmospheric density.
  AC-10a also has an optical beacon to serve as a target for AC-10b.
 
  Aerocube-10b, a 1.5U cubesat with a steam thruster, to carry out proximity
  manuevering near AC-10a.

  Seeker, a 3U cubesat from NASA JSC to serve as an inspector satellite maneuvering
  in the vicinity of the Chaffee.

  Kenobi, a 3U cubesat from NASA JSC which will remain attached to the NRCSD-E and
  will relay data from Seeker.

Finally, the SEOPS LLC Slingshot system will be attached to the Chaffee before it 
departs ISS, and will deploy further cubesats whose identities have not yet been
revealed. These cubesats will be delivered to ISS on the next Dragon.


PSLV
-----

It has now been confirmed that the two NanoAvionics cubesats M6P and
BlueWalker-1 were ejected into the wrong orbit (435 x 514 km instead of
493 x 510 km), probably due to a deployment hang-up delaying the
ejection until after the final PSLV-PS4 burn.

Arabsat 6A
-----------

The Arabsat 6A communications satellite was launched by the first operational
Falcon Heavy on Apr 11. The two side cores landed back at Cape Canaveral
and the center core landed downrange on the OCISLY droneship. The second
stage carried on to parking orbit and then after a second burn
to highly elliptical supersynchronous transfer orbit of 324 x 90078 km x 23.0 deg
By Apr 26 the satellite was in a 36074 x 89938 km x 1.3 deg, ready to lower 
apogee to GEO.

During the voyage back to port the core stage toppled over onto the deck
of the OCISLY and was partly destroyed.



B'reshit
--------

The SpaceIL lunar lander made several orbit circularization burns from Apr 4 to Apr 10.
On Apr 6 apogee was lowered from 10000 km to 750 km; on Apr 8 at 0548 UTC
the orbit was reduced to 211 x 467 km, and on Apr 10 about 1700 UTC to 16 x 200 km.
On Apr 11 at 1912 UTC B'reshit began its landing burn, but after failure
of an IMU the main engine cut off. It was restarted too late to save the landing,
with impact (possibly near 18E 32N) at 1923 UTC Apr 11.

Beidou
------

China launched a new Beidou 3 satellite on Apr 20 to geostationary transfer orbit.
It reportedly was planned to enter an inclined GEO at 55 degrees, with apogee
burn apparently on Apr 21, but as of Apr 30 the satellite had not been tracked
in its new orbit.

Tianhui-2 Group 1
-----------------

On Apr 29 China launched two new mapping satellites,  Tianhui-2 01 zu 01
xing and Tianhui-2 01 zu 02 xing, into a 0600 local time descending node
sun-synchronous orbit. The vehicle was launched at 2252 UTC and entered
orbit around 2305 UTC; After payload separation the third stage made a
perigee-lowering burn at 2311 UTC.

Hammaguir
---------

From 1952 to 1967, France's main space launch site was the CIEES (Centre
Interarmees d'Essais d'Engins Speciaux) B2 site at Hammaguir, Algeria. 
(The older CIEES B0 and CIEES B1 were at Colomb-Bechar to the northeast,
and were used for small military missile tests). Until 2015, as far as I
can tell, no map of the CIEES B2 had been publicly available. The French
space agency CNES then released a 1965 map for the 2015 celebrations of
the anniversary of the first French satellite launch. Thanks to this,
which I just became aware of (courtesy of @syncloss on twitter),  it is
now possible to identify the locations of the launch pads at CIEES B2.

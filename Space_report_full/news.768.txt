International Space Station
---------------------------

Expedition 60 continues.

On Aug 6, the Canadarm-2 unberthed the S.S. Roger Chaffee (Cygnus NG-11)
from the Unity module at 1330 UTC and released it into orbit at 1615
UTC.

On Aug 7 at 1300 UTC, cubesats Aerocube-10a and Aerocube-10b were
deployed from the Nanoracks NRCSD-E deployer on Cygnus. The satellites
are nicknamed JimSat and DougSat respectively.

Sometime probably on Aug 7 the Hypergiant
SEOPS/Spaceflight Inc Slingshot deployer was also used to deploy four
cubesats: RTFSat (3U), from Northwest Nazarene University, NARSScube-2
(1U) from Egypt,  Quantum Radar 3 (3U) from Hypergiant, and the
DARPA/Hypergiant ORCA  6U cubesat to test an intersatellite radio link.
Unfortunately the deployment time has not been made public.

On Aug 19 the Dextre arm unberthed the IDA-3 docking adapter from Dragon
CRS-18's trunk. On Aug 21 at about 1100 UTC Dextre soft docked IDA-3 to
the PMA-3 docking port. Then, at 1219 UTC, the Quest airlock was
depressurised and astronauts Hague and Morgan began spacewalk ISS
EVA-55, with spacesuits 3006 and 3008 and SAFER backpack units 18 and 13
respectively. The hatch was open at 1226 UTC and the astronauts went to
battery power a minute later. They connected cables to IDA-3 and
activated it; IDA-3 was firmlymated to PMA3 between 1443 and 1500 UTC.
At 1614 UTC Dextre released the IDA and at 1641 UTC the astronauts
removed its thermal cover (which was stuffed in a bag and returned to
the airlock). Two `hemi reflectors' were installed and after some final
connections the astronauts returned to the Quest airlock, with hatch
close at 1855 UTC and repressurization at 1859 UTC.

The PMA-3 port with its APAS adapter was designed for Shuttle dockings;
the IDA-3 converts it to be suitable for Crew Dragon and Starliner dockings.


On Aug 22 Roskosmos launched Soyuz MS-14 on a Soyuz-2-1a rocket. This
was the first launch of the comnbination and tested the interaction of
the modern rocket's digital control system with the old-fashioned Soyuz
spaceship's abort system. Soyuz MS-14 was launched without a crew,
but a humanoid robot Skybot F-850 'Fyodor' takes up one of the seats.
Soyuz MS-14 also carries 658 kg of cargo for ISS.


Blagovest
----------

On Aug 5 Russia launched a Proton-M with the Blagovest No. 14L military communications
satellite. The Briz-M upper stage delivered it to geosynchronous orbit. On Aug 20
it was drifting west over the Indian Ocean.

Ariane
------

Arianespace flew an Ariane 5 on Aug 6 placing the EDRS-C and Intelsat
IS-39 comms satellites in geotransfer orbit. By Aug 20 both satellites
were in near-GEO drift orbits.  EDRS-C (European Data Relay Satellite),
to be located at 31E, has a laser communications payload. It also
carries a secondary Ka-band payload, Hylas 3, for Avanti Communications.
IS-39 will replace Intelsat 901 over the Indian Ocean.

Amos 17
-------

SpaceX launched a Falcon 9 on Aug 6. No attempt was made to recover the
B1047 first stage, which was on its third flight. The second stage
placed the AMOS 17 communications satellite in geotransfer orbit. AMOS
17 is a Boeing 702MP satellite for Israel's Spacecom. By Aug 19 it was
on station in GEO at 13.8E.

AEHF-5
------

ULA's Atlas V flight AV-083, using the powerful 551 model, was launched
on Aug 8. Centaur AV-083 made three burns to a high perigee GTO to drop
off the strategic US military communications satellite AEHF 5. After the
second burn, a 12U cubesat called TDO was ejected into geotransfer
orbit. TDO, for the USAF Space and Missile Command, tests satellite and
space debris tracking technologies.

By Aug 21, AEHF 5 was in a 24870 x 35300 km orbit.

Jielong-1
---------

The Changzheng Houjian YG (China Long March Rocket Co), a
commercialization subsidiary of the government CALT launch vehicle
manufacturer, carried out its first orbital launch on Aug 17. The
Jielong-1 (Smart Dragon 1) four-stage solid rocket put three satellites
in sun-synchronous orbit.

Qiancheng-1 01 xing is an imaging satellite for Qiancheng Exploration Tech Co (Beijing).
Xingshidai-5 is a test satellite for Guoxing Aerospace (Chengdu), using a Weina MN10 bus.
Tianqi-2 is a satellite for Guodian Gaokeji (Beijing) for IoT data relay.


Zhongxing-18
------------

The Zhongxing-18 (Chinasat-18) C/Ku/Ka-band communications sat, using
the enhanced DFH-4E bus, was launched by CZ-3B S/N Y58 on Aug 19 to
geotransfer orbit. However, it was announced that the payload was
malfunctioning following its separation from the upper stage.

Electron 8
----------

The 8th Rocket Lab Electron launch from New Zealand placed the BlackSky Global 4
imaging satellite in orbit together with three 6U cubesats: the signals
intelligence (spectrum monitoring) BRO-ONE for the Breton company Unseen
Labs and two Pearl White technology cubesats for USAF Space Command.
On this flight, the kick stage does not appear to have been cataloged
and may have been deorbited. Although RocketLab videos describing Electron
tout its ability to deorbit and not leave junk around, most and possibly
all of the previous Electron flights have actually left their kick stages up.

    Electron 8       Deorbited?  Number of unid tracked objects same as number of payloads


GPS
---

The second GPS Block III satellite, nicknamed Magellan, was launched on
Aug 22 aboard a Delta 4 from Cape Canaveral. The Delta 4 second stage
deorbited itself south of South Africa at the end of its first orbit.

Chandrayaan-2
-------------

Chandrayaan-2 made its translunar injection burn  at 2051 UTC Aug 13,
raising apogee to 408,000 km. Lunar orbit insertion occurred around 0330
UTC Aug 20 into a 114 x 18072 km x 87.8 deg orbit.

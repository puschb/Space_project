International Space Station
---------------------------

Expedition 63 continues.

The DARPA REDEYE-2 satellite was deployed at 1750:00 Jun 17. Deployment was by the Dextre SPDM, not the JRMS.
The SPDM extracted the Nanoracks Kaber deployer from the Kibo airlock slide table, and the satellite
was ejected from the Kaber. REDEYE-3 was deployed around 2110 UTC on Jun 23, using the same system.
REDEYE-1, 2 and 3 have the alternate nicknames PINOT, MERLOT and CABERNET. (You should not confuse
these with the 1961-1962 USAF/SAFSP sigint payloads GRAPE JUICE 1, 2 and 3.)

On Jun 26 Chris Cassidy and Bob Behnken made spacewalk US EVA-65 to replace batteries supporting the 1B solar array
channel, in the Integrated Equipment Assembly (IEA) on the S6 truss segment.
Cassidy used suit EMU 3006 and SAFER 15; Behnken used EMU 3004 and SAFER 18.
The airlock was depressurized at 1128 UTC with hatch open at 1131 UTC. At 1138 UTC, just after
Cassidy emerged from the airlock, his left wrist mirror (0.04 kg, 0.1 x 0.1 x 0.02m) floated off and
was lost. It's pretty small, so it may not get a catalog number.

The Canadarm-2 removed the EP9 external pallet (delivered by HTV-9) from the MBS POA and
positioned it near S6. The astronauts then moved batteries and adapter plates between S6 and EP9:
 at 1246 UTC, NiH battery 0075 was removed from S6/1B slot 1, and installed in EP9 slot X at 1300 UTC.
 at 1314 UTC, Li-ion battery 0025 was removed from EP9 slot A and installed in S6/1B slot 1 at 1329 UTC.
 at 1343 UTC, NiH battery 0076 was removed from S6/1B slot 2 and installed in EP9 slot A at 1415 UTC.
 at 1406 UTC, Adapter plate (unknown serial) was removed from EP9 slot A, and put in S6/1B slot 2 at 1417 UTC.
 at 1435 UTC, NiH battery 0091 was removed from S6/1B slot 3 and installed on the AP in slot 2 at 1442 UTC
 at 1500 UTC, Li-ion battery 0024 was removed from EP9 slot B and installed in S6/1B slot 3 at 1517 UTC.
 at 1535 UTC, NiH battery 0092 was removed from S6/1B slot 4 and installed in EP9 slot B at 1558 UTC.
 at 1553 UTC, Adapter plate (unknown serial) was removed from EP9 slot B and installed in S6/1B slot 4 at 1605 UTC.
 at 1645 UTC, NiH battery 0090 was removed from S1/1B slot 6 and installed on the AP on slot 4 at 1648 UTC.

The hatch was closed at 1736 UTC and the airlock repressurization began at 1739 UTC after 6h 11 min.

On Jul 1 Cassidy and Behnken made spacewalk US EVA-66, completing the 1B battery work.
Airlock depress 1108 UTC, hatch open 1112 UTC.
 At 1156 UTC, Li-ion battery 0026 was removed from EP9 slot D and installed in S6/1B slot 6 at 1207 UTC.
 At 1224 UTC, NiH battery 0089 was removed from S6/1B slot 5 and installed in EP9 slot D at 1245 UTC.
 At 1240 UTC, Adapter plate (unknown serial) was removed from EP9 slot D and installed in S6/1B slot 5 at 1248 UTC.
The astronauts then prepared the 3B worksite for the next spacewalk, routed some cables, and
attempted but failed to remove an old fixture from one of the solar array masts.
They closed the airlock hatch at 1711 UTC and repressurized the airlock at 1714 UTC after  6hr 6min.

On Jul 3 at 1553 UTC Progress MS-14 fired its engines to raise the ISS orbit 1 km for
debris collision avoidance (COLA). This was the first COLA burn for ISS since 2015.
The debris object 27923 (1987-079AG) was predicted to pass within 1 km of the station at 1828 UTC Jul 3
over the South Atlantic near the Falkland Islands. The object was one of 42 cataloged from the 1996 breakup
of a SOZ motor from a Sep 1987 Proton launch that put three Glonass satellites in orbit.

On Jul 8 at 1822 UTC the older Progress MS-13 cargo ship undocked from the Pirs module to complete
its mission. It fired its engines at 2131 UTC to deorbit over the South Pacific, with reentry at 2205 UTC.


GaoFen 9-03
-----------

The GaoFen 9 03 satellite was launched on Jun 17. It is a high resolution imaging satellite.
Two small satellites were also aboard: Zheda Pixing 3A from Zhejiang U., and HEAD-5
from HEAD Aerospace.

Beidou DW55
----------

The final Beidou-3 satellite was launched on Jun 23, completing China's flagship navigation
satellite system. Beidou DW55 is the third of the geostationary Beidou-3 satellites.
Beidou DW55 probably made its apogee burn on Jun 24; it was tracked on Jul 6 in
a 35764 x 35809 km x 3.1 deg GEO over 110.5 deg East.


GPS III SV03
------------

The third of the third generation GPS satellites was launched on Jun 30. A SpaceX Falcon 9
took off from Cape Canaveral at 2010 UTC with the first stage landing on the droneship Just Read The Instructions
at 2019 UTC. The second stage reached a 168 x 434 km parking orbit at 2018 UTC. A second burn
of the second stage boosted the payload to a 402 x 20197 km x  55 deg deployment orbit at 2115 UTC; the 4311 kg GPS
satellite separated from the stage at 2140 UTC and the stage fired for a third time a few minutes later
to lower its perigee into the atmosphere; it reentered south of S Africa at about 0230 UTC Jul 1.

As of Jul 9 no TLEs had been released for the payload since Jul 1, so it cannot yet be confirmed
whether the apogee burn was successful.


GaoFen DuoMo
-------------

On Jul 3 China's SAST launched a CZ-4B from Taiyuan with CAST's GaoFen DuoMo Weixing (High Resolution MultiMode
Satellite), carrying a 1 metre aperture imager, into a 1026 LTDN sun-synchronous orbit.
The BY70-2 (Baiyu-02) amateur radio cubesat was a secondary payload.

Electron Flight 13
------------------

Rocket Lab's Electron Flight 13, nicknamed 'Pics or it Didn't Happen', was launched on Jul 4 from New Zealand
but failed during second stage burn. It carried the Canon Electronics CE-SAT-1B, In-Space Missions' Faraday 1
6U cubesat, and five Planet imaging satellites, Flock 4e-1 to 5. The vehicle probably impacted 700 km S of Wellington.

Shiyan 6-02
-----------

China's SAST launched a CZ-2D from Jiuquan on Jul 4 with the Shiyan weixing 6 02 xing payload.
The satellite entered a 686 x 706 km x 98.2 deg sun-sync orbit with 0600 LTDN.

Ofeq' 16
--------

Israel launched the Ofeq'-16 spy satellite at 0100 UTC Jul 6. The satellite was soon located
by observers in a 331 x 604 km x 140.9 deg orbit.

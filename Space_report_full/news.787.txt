International Space Station
---------------------------

Expedition 64 continues under the command of Sergey Ryzhikov.

On Dec 6, SpaceX launched Dragon CRS-21 from Kennedy Space Center. The Falcon 9 first
stage landed on the OCISLY droneship. CRS-21 is the first cargo mission for Dragon 2.
As for Crew Dragon, and unlike the orginal cargo Dragon, Cargo Dragon 2 has no deployable
solar arrays, does not jettison its nose cap during launch, and once reaching ISS docks with an IDA
docking port (IDA-3) instead of being captured by Canadarm-2.  CRS-21 indeed docked with IDA-3
on Node 2 Zenith at 1840 UTC Dec 7. 

In the Dragon trunk is the Nanoracks Bishop Airlock. The 1090 kg airlock will be installed
on ISS Node 3. In use it will be unberthed from Node 3 by Canadarm-2  and satellites will
be ejected from it in that unberthed configuration; it will then be reinstalled on Node 3.
Among the pressurized cargo was a refurbished spacesuit, EMU 3015. It will replace
EMU 3008, which will be returned to Earth aboard CRS-21 when it lands.


Chang'e-5
----------

China's CALT launched a Chang Zheng 5 (serial Y5) from Wenchang at 2030
UTC on Nov 23. The second stage reached parking orbit at 2042 UTC and
reignited at 2058 UTC for a 7 minute burn to enter a high apogee orbit.
At 2106 UTC the payload, the Chang'e-5 moon probe, separated from the
second stage. 

The 8200 kg Chang'e-5, devloped by CAST/Beijing and the Chinese Lunar
Exploration Program, is a robotic sample return mission - the first such
to the Moon since Luna-24 in 1976. The mission successfully landed on
the Moon and returned its samples to Earth after a 23 day mission.
It included the first automatic rendezvous, docking and sample transfer in 
deep space.

Chang'e-5 consists of a number of components ( abbreviations are mine):

 - SM, Service module, which will perform lunar orbit insertion and transearth insertion burns.
       Chinese name: Guidao Qi (orbiter vehicle)
 - DS, descent stage (Lander), which will separate in lunar orbit, land near Mons Rumker, and obtain a surface sample.
       Chinese name: Zhuolu Qi (lander vehicle)
 - AS, Ascent stage, which will take off from the lunar surface carrying the sample and dock with
    the service module's docking adapter in lunar orbit. 
       Chinese name: Shangsheng Qi (ascent vehicle)
 - AD, Adapter, which joins the service module to the lander at launch and contains the return capsule
    and docking adapter.  Chinese name: Lianje Zhijia (connecting frame, adapter). Left in lunar orbit.
 - DA, Docking adapter, mounted on top of the return capsule. Contains a mechanism to transfer the sample
    from the ascent stage to the return capsule.  Chinese name: Jiaohui duijie jigou (rendezvous/docking mechanism)
 - RV, Return capsule, which separates from the service module and lands in China.
       Chinese name: Fanhui Qi (return vehicle)

I have updated GCAT to include the Chang'e-5 ascent stage (`Shangsheng Qi') launch as follows:
 - The engine is for now designated as SSQ Engine until we get a real desigation for it.
 - The launch vehicle is designated CE-5 SSQ (short for Chang'e-5 Shangsheng Qi)
 - The launch vehicle is part of the new launch family CE5SSQ             
 - I am calling the launch site Louville Omega North, and giving it the site code LOMN.
   The launch `pad' is CE-5 ZQ (short for Chang'e 5 Zhoulu Qi, CE-5 lander). 
 - The launch from the lunar surface is given the launch designation 2020-U02
 - The ascent stage is GCAT deep space catalog number D01048.
     It has launch code 2020-087 until lunar landing, and 2020-U02 afterwards.
     The entries for its launch and lunar orbit may be found in the LPRCAT event catalog.

Starlink
--------

The 16th Starlink launch (15th of the V1.0 series) on Nov 25 was also the 100th launch of a Falcon 9.
The single-burn deployment released 60 satellites in low orbit. The first stage landed on the droneship
OCISLY.


JDRS-1
------

Mitsubishi Heavy Industries launched H-2A number F43 from Tanegashima on Nov 29. The rocket carried
JAXA's `Hikari deta chukei shistemu' (Optical Data Relay System), also known as JDRS-1 (Japanese Data
Relay Satellite 1). The JAXA satellite will support civilian and intelligence users, and the launch
was carried out with more secrecy than usual. The satellite reached GEO by Dec 8 and is now on
station at 90.8E.

FalconEye-2
-----------

FalconEye-2, a French-built imaging satellite for the armed forces of the United Arab Emirates,
was launched from the Guiana Space Centre by a Soyuz ST-A on Dec 2. The satellite replaces
FalconEye-1 which was lost in the Vega VV15 failure in 2019.

Gonets-M
--------

Three more Gonets-M low orbit messaging satellites were launched on a
Soyuz from Plesetsk on Dec 3. A test nanosatellite for the Ministry of
Defense, ERA-1, was also carried and given the name Kosmos-2548.

Gaofen 14
---------

China's CAST/Beijing built the Gaofen 14 satellite for  3D surveying and
mapping  to produce topographic maps and digital elevation models. Its
launch on Dec 6 was the first from Xichang to sun-sync orbit, using a
CZ-3B/G5. This was also the first launch of the G5 variant of the Chang
Zheng 3B rocket. 


GECAM 
------

China launched two GECAM satellites on Dec 9. The satellites, built by
the Shangai Engineering Center for Microsatellites, carry all-sky gamma
ray burst detectors. The aim is to detect GRBs that are associated with
gravitational wave events detected by LIGO and VIRGO. The two satellites
(GECAM A and B) have been nicknamed Xiaoji and Xiaomu.

NROL-44
-------

On Dec 9 ULA launched a Delta 4 Heavy from Cape Canaveral Space Force
Station (newly renamed as of that day) carrying a payload for the US
National Reconnaissance Office. The launch was codenamed NROL-44. The
rocket's second stage made a three-burn ascent to deliver its payload
directly to geosynchronous orbit. The payload, codenamed USA 311, is
probably an ORION signals intelligence satellite.

SXM-7
-----

On Dec 13 SpaceX launched the SXM-7 satellite on a Falcon 9. The B1051
first stage landed on the droneship Just Read The Instructions. The
second stage delivered the 7000 kg payload to a subsynchronous transfer
orbit. SXM-7, owned by Sirius XM, is a digital radio broadcasting
satellite and will use its onboard propellant to reach geostationary
orbit. The satellite is an LS-1300 type built by Maxar.

Angara
-------

After a six year gap the second Angara-A5 test flight took off from
Plesetsk on Dec 14 carrying a dummy payload. The Briz-M upper stage made
several burns to geosynchronous orbit, jettisoning its DTB propellant
tank into a 379 x 36851 km x 60.0 deg orbit. It then  carried out a
simulated payload-deployment test, followed by a manuever to a 36923 x
37595 km x 0.1 deg graveyard orbit. The dummy payload was left attached
to it.  


Electron 17
-----------

RocketLab launched Electron mission 17 on Dec 15, placing a small 150 kg radar satellite (Strix-Alpha) in orbit
for the Japanese company Synspective.

Astra Rocket 3.2
----------------

Astra launched Rocket 3.2 from Kodiak on Dec 15 on another orbital
attempt with only diagnostic instrumentation and no separable payload.
For the first time the Astra rocket completed successfuly first stage
flight, first stage separation, fairing separation, and second stage
ignition. The second stage burn was about 0.5 km/s short of orbital
velocity and the vehicle fell in the Pacific after reaching an apogee of
380 km.


SpaceBEE
--------

Six of the SpaceBEE satellites launched on Electron 16 belong to SwarmNZ, the New Zealand subsdiary
of Swarm Technologies, and will be registered as New Zealand rather than US satellites.


Hayabusa-2
------------

Japan's Hayabusa-2 asteroid mining mission has successfully returned its
quarried asteroid rock to Earth. The spacecraft entered the Earth's
gravitational sphere at 2254 UTC Dec 1 on an impact trajectory. 220,000
km from Earth at  0530 UTC Dec 5, it ejected its sample return capsule
and then in three burns at 0630, 0700 and 0730 UTC raised its perigee to
about 300 km, allowing a flyby to send it back out to solar orbit.

The sample return capsule entered the atmosphere at 1728 UTC Dec 5,
travelling at 11.6 km/s with an entry angle of -12 degrees. After entry
the backshell and aeroshell were ejected and the capsule deployed its
parachute, floating down to a safe landing at 136.15E 30.43S in the
Woomera Prohibited Area in South Australia.

The parent spacecraft will make a flyby of minor planet 2001 CC21 in 2026, and following Earth
flybys in 2027 and 2028, will rendezvous with minor planet 1998 JY26 in 2031.

Erratum
--------

 Obviously, I forgot to delete the line 'spacewalk underway..' in the last issue.

Table of Recent Suborbital Launches
-----------------------------------

The US DoD reports a Russian direct-ascent antisatellite (ASAT) test on Dec 16. I understand
the missile was not tested against a target satellite; at most just a `point in space' target.
NOTAMs suggest launch was between 0100 and 0600 UTC. Unclear what the apogee was, but possibly
a few hundred km.

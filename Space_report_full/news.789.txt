International Space Station
---------------------------

Expedition 64 continues under the command of Sergey Ryzhikov.

Cygnus NG-14, the S.S. Kalpana Chawla, was deorbited on Jan 26 with
entry over the S Pacific at 2023 UTC. It departed ISS on Jan 6 and spent
20 days in a 475 x 490 km orbit.

On Jan 27 astronauts Hopkins and Glover performed spacewalk US EVA-69
using spacesuits EMU 3006 and 3009. SAFER backpacks 13 and 18 were also
used. The Quest airlock was depressurized by about 1118 UTC and the
hatch was opened at 1126 UTC, with the astronauts putting the suits on
battery power 2 min later. The first major task was to install the ColKa
antenna on the outside of ESA's Columbus module. ColKa, built by
MDA/Harwell in England, provides high bandwidth Ka-band science data
download. The ColKa package was launched on the Cygnus NG-13 mission in
Feb 2020 and has been stored inside ISS since then. The package has a
mass of 105 kg plus a 15 kg removable cover. Glover mounted the
Canadarm-2 at ESP-2 and carried ColKa to Columbus, installing it at 1242
UTC and completing bolting it down by 1316 UTC. Next the astronauts
routed cables to ColKa and to the Bartomoleo platform. (Unfortunately,
two Bartomoleo cables could not be connected and were left tied down for
a future EVA.) The ColKA cover was removed at 1529 UTC and jettisoned
into space by Glover at 1600 UTC. The cover was cataloged as S47513,
1998-067RY in a 417 x 421 km orbit. The astronauts then retrieved
equipment from the airlock and moved to the P6 truss to remove two
H-fixture bolts from the solar array mast there. The astronauts returned
to the airlock, ingressing at 1813 UTC and closing the hatch at 1820
UTC. Quest was repressurized at 1824 UTC.

On Jan 29 the Dextre arm removed a spare LiIon battery, attached to a
FRAM adapter plate, from the ESP-3 stowage platform. The battery was
launched to ISS in the Dragon CRS-19 trunk. Dextre then removed old NiH
batteries 72 and 69 from P4 IEA slot 5 and 6. The new battery was then
removed from its FRAM and placed in slot 5. One of the old batteries was
stowed on the HTV-9 EP-9 external pallet, and the other was attached to
the FRAM, which then was put back on ESP-3.

If any of my readers know the LiIon battery serial number, please let me know.

EVA-70 on Feb 1 completed the battery work. Hopkins and Glover,  using the same suits,
depressurized Quest by 1248 UTC, opened the hatch at 1255 UTC, and went to battery
power at 1256 UTC. They went to the P4 IEA. In slot 2 were two adapter plates, one
on top of the other. They removed the top one, AP0009, and installed it
in the empty slot 6, and connected it to the battery in slot 5. This marks
the near completion of 3 years of battery replacement work at ISS; all that
remains is to dispose of the EP-9 pallet with its old batteries.

The astronauts then removed two more H-fixtures from solar array masts,
replaced a EVTCG camera group on the CP3 boom at S1 lower outboard,
added a new HD camera to the camera group on the Destiny module's CP13 boom,
and installed a new WVEB  (Wrist Vision Equipment Box) camera at the base of the
Japanese JRMS robot arm. They returned to airlock with hatch closure at 1812 UTC
and repressurization at 1815 UTC.


The Progress MS-15 cargo ship undocked from Pirs at 0521:30 UTC Feb 9.
It fired its engine for the 3.5-minute deorbit burn at 0830:11 UTC with
debris impact in the S Pacific at 0913 UTC. Progress MS-16 was launched
on Feb 15 and docked with the Pirs module at 0626  UTC Feb 16.

On Feb 20 Northrop Grumman launched the Cygnus NG-15 cargo ship, S.S.
Katherine Johnson, on an Antares 230+ rocket from the Mid-Atlantic
Regional Spaceport at Wallops Island, Virginia. NG-15 will rendezvous
with the ISS; the 8050 kg spacecraft includes 3734 kg of pressurized
cargo. Aboard Cygnus for later deployment is a JAXA J-SSOD (#16) with
seven cubesats: Paraguay's first satellite, GuaraniSat; a Filipino
satellite, Maya-2; Kyushu Tech's Tsuru; Tel Aviv University's TAU-SAT;
Moldova's first satellite, the Technical University of Moldova's
TUMnanosat; Osaka OPU's Hirogari; and RymanSat's RSP-01. The S.S. Katherine
Johnson was captured by Candarm-2 at 0938 UTC Feb 22 and berthed on the
Unity module at 1216 UTC.

J-SSOD-16 will be transferred to Kibo for later
deployment. Nanoracks NRCSD-E and SEOPS-LLC Slingshot deployers are also
attached to Cygnus and will deploy their payloads after NG-15 leaves
ISS. Slingshot will deploy Gunsmoke-J and two other military cubesats
(maybe LANL/SOCOM Prometheus 2 sats?). NRCSD-E carries the UAE's
DhabiSat and the IT-SPINS satellite from Montana State U.

Also aboard the Antares were nine ThinSat `strings' (each a set of small
payload boxes connected by cables), ejected from the Antares second
stage 13 min after launch. The satellites are expected to reenter
in a matter of days. Each ThinSat string is 1 to 2 kg in mass and
up to 2 metres long, but they have not been added to the US satellite catalog
despite meeting the traditional criteria for being counted as satellites.
I have added them to the GCAT auxiliary catalog as objects A09696 to A09704.

Transporter-1
-------------

On Jan 24 SpaceX launched the Transporter-1 mission, placing a record
number of satellites in orbit on a single launch. 110 satellites were
deployed, plus a dispenser structure and 4 support rods. Two of the
satellites are dispenser craft containing a total of 33 further
satellites to be deployed in the coming weeks, so the total number of
payloads associated with the launch will be 143. The second stage
entered parking orbit at 1508 UTC, and circularized its orbit at 1554
UTC. Deployments occurred from 1558 to 1631 UTC. The Sherpa-FX satellite
then deployed subsatellites from about 1800 to 2000 UTC.

The second stage was deorbited in the south Pacific west of Chile at
about 1658 UTC and the first stage landed on the OCISLY droneship.

Transporter-1 is a complex mission. The second stage carried a stack of
10 Starlink satellites. Above the Starlinks was a payload adapter with
three ESPA rings above it. The ESPA rings are designated A, B and C with
C being the topmost one. The various rideshare payloads were attached to
dispensers on the four large ports around each ESPA ring. In addition,
an extra dispenser location was present on the top ring, and the Falcon
9 second stage had a cubesat dispenser attached to its aft end next to
the rocket engine.

The mission is a good illustration of the importance of new layer of
intermediary space companies that bundle satellite deployments, sitting
between the launch vehicle providers and the satellite owners. In my
opinion, this extra `service industry' layer is a sign of the existence
of a mature commerical space economy. 

The Transporter 1 payloads, excluding Starlink, are listed below.
The satellites are mostly from the USA except where noted. The 143 satellites
have 24 different owner/operators from 11 countries.

The first two of these, Flock 4s-48 and 45, were deployed on Feb 8 and 10; deployments continue.



YG-31
-----

The second YG-31 group, Yaogan 31 group 2 (YG-31 hao 02 zu 01,02,03 xing) was launched from Jiuquan
on Jan 29. The satellites are suspected to be ocean surveillance signals intelligence satellites
similar to the US Navy/NRO NOSS-PARCAE satellites launched since the 1970s.

SQ-1
----

The second Shang Quxian 1 (Hyperbola-1) orbital rocket from iSpace
(Interstellary Glory Space Tech) was launched from Jiuquan on Feb 1, but
failed to reach orbit. There are some indications that the failure
occurred during first stage burn. Payload currently unknown; initial reports that the Fangzhou2
cubesat was aboard were incorrect.


This launch, SQ-1 Y2, used a modified version of the rocket with 1.4 m diameter second
and third stages (Y1 used 1.2m diamaeter for these stages). In GCAT this version will
be labelled as variant 2.

Lotos-S
-------

Russia launched a Soyuz-2-1b from Plesetsk on Feb 2 carrying the fifth Lotos-S electronic
intelligence satellite. As normal for these satellites, it entered a 245 x 899 km x 67.1 deg
orbit and then circularized to 901 x 910 km on Feb  8.
The satellite will probably get the cover name Kosmos-2549.

TJS 6
-----

China's CALT launched a CZ-3B on Feb 4 with the TJS 6 satellite. TJS 6 is thought to be a cover name
for the Huoyan-3 early warning satellite. By Feb 19 the satellite reached geostationary orbit
at 178.5E.

Mars
----

The UAE's Misabar Al'amal (Hope Probe) spacecraft entered  Mars'
gravitational sphere of influence at 0236 UTC Feb 5 and went into orbit
around Mars at 1737 UTC Feb 9 with the completion of its orbit insertion
burn.  Orbit was expected to be about 1000 x 49380 km x 19.6 deg.
China's Tianwen-1 entered the sphere of influence at 1435 UTC Feb 5 and
completed Mars orbit insertion at 1208 UTC Feb 10.  Orbit was 445 x
180011 km x 10.4 deg; on Feb 15 it changed its orbit to 278 x 181532 km
x 87.3 deg and on Feb 20 to 278 x 84591 km x 87.7 deg.

The Mars 2020 spacecraft, with the Perseverance rover, entered Mars' gravitational sphere at 0200 UTC
Feb 14, on a -85 x -19810 km x 23.0 deg hyperbolic impact trajectory.
It arrived on Mars on Feb 18:
  At 2026:46 UTC, the cruise stage was jettisoned at 1600 km altitude 
  At 2028:48 UTC, two 70 kg cruse mass balance devices were jettisoned at 1258 km altitude.
  At 2036:52 UTC, the vehicle aeroshell reached entry interface at 5.4 km/s velocity, 125 km altitude.
  At 2040:39 UTC, six smaller balance masses (about 25 kg each) were ejected at 21 km altitude.
  At 2040:55 UTC the main parachute was deployed, 11 km up.
  At 2041:17 UTC the aeroshell (heat shield) was ejected at 10 km.
  At 2042:42 UTC the backshell and its attached parachute were ejected at 2.2 km.
  At 2043:26 UTC the descent stage (skycrane) separated from the rover, lowering it on cables. 
  At 2043:42 UTC the descent stage performed a flyaway maneuver and the rover landed on the surface.
  At 2043:49 UTC the descent stage shut off its engines and crashed nearby shortly theareafter
The rover and helicopter are reported to be healthy, and the rover continues to return images
from the surface. By my estimates,
  Rover landing location was around 77.4508E 18.4446N in Jezero Crater on the edge of Isidis Planitia
  Heat shield:                      77.4741E 18.4553N
  Backshell:                        77.7418E 18.4516N
  Descent stage:                    77.4419E 18.4522N


Starlink
--------

Starlink launches on 2021 Feb 4 and Feb 16 each placed 60 more Starlink satellites in orbit.

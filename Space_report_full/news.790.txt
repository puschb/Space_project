International Space Station
---------------------------

Expedition 64 continues under the command of Sergey Ryzhikov.

On Feb 28 astronauts Rubins and Glover carried out spacewalk EVA-71 to begin
installing solar array modification kits. They used EMUs 3015 and 3009, with
SAFER 13 and 18.  The first mod kit was installed
on solar array mast canister 2B, on the P6 truss segment. Each 150 kg kit consists
of a truss consisting of three lower struts (left, middle, right) and 
an `upper triangle' with a mounting bracket. The new IROSA solar arrays,
to be launched later this year, will be installed on the brackets.
 
The work went more slowly than expected. The 2B kit was completed but with
some issues with the bolts. The upper triangle for the 4B kit was assembled but
not installed; it was tied to the 4B IEA and the work is expected to be completed
during the next spacewalk. Airlock depressurization was at 1101 UTC with
hatch open at 1111 UTC; hatch was closed at 1811 UTC and the airlock began
repressurization at 1816 UTC. Rubins reported she had an ear blockage, so
the repress was slower than usual and passed the 50 mbar level I use to mark
EVA at 1818 UTC.

On Mar 5 Rubins and Noguchi completed the work with EVA-72, installing
the 4B mod kit on the 4B mast canister and tightening the bolts on the
2B kit. The airlock was depressurized from 1133 to 1836 UTC; the hatch
was open from 1336 to 1828 UTC.

External Pallet 9 (EP9) was launched on the Japanese HTV 9 cargo ship in May 2020
and was installed on ISS on Jun 1. It now has nine old NiH batteries stowed on it.
Canadarm-2 unberthed the pallet from the MBS POA LEE mounting point on the mobile
transporter on the station truss on Mar 11 around 0200 UTC, and released EP9 into
space at 1330 UTC. EP9 with the nine batteries has a mass of around 2600
kg. It will remain in orbit for several years.

On Mar 13 Glover (EMU 3009) and Hopkins (EMU 3006) left the Quest airlock on
EVA-73. The airlock was depressurized at 1309 UTC and repressurized at 2003 UTC;
the hatch was open from 1314 to 1959 UTC. First the astronauts went to P6
and vented two old ammonia jumper cables that were used for the Early Ammonia Servicer
system prior to its 2007 jettison. One was moved to the Quest airlock. The astronauts
also installed a stiffener on the airlock thermal cover, and worked on the Bartolomeo
connectors that gave trouble on an earlier spacewalk. Cable routing to the CP9
camera position was completed and cable routing to the CP8 position was partially done.

On Mar 14 the JRMS arm extracted J-SSOD-16 from the Kibo airlock for
cubesat deployements. At 1120 UTC J-SSOD-16 ejected OPUSAT-II (Osaka
Prefectural University), GuaraniSat-1  (Paraguay), Maya-2 (Phillipines),
Tsuru (Kyushu Tech), RSP-01 (RymanSat club). Later the same day it
ejected Nichirin (WARP-01) for WarpSpace Co. Ltd, Tsukuba; TAU-SAT-1 for
Tel-Aviv University; and Sanko (STARS-EC) for Shizuoka Univ.

On Mar 19 Ryzhikov, Kud-Sverchkov and Rubins entered Soyuz MS-17 and flew it from the Rassvet
docking port to the Poisk docking port. Undocking was at 1638 UTC and redocking at 1712 UTC.

On Mar 22 around 0830 UTC the 50-kg-class Lawkanat-1 (MMSAT-1) satellite
was quietly ejected from the J-SSOD-M2 deployer, with no announcement
from JAXA. Lawkanat-1 is a joint Hokkaido-Myanmar Earth imaging
satellite whose deployment became controversial following the coup in
Myanmar. This satellite was launched to ISS on NG-15 and is similar to
the Diwata satellites. The satellite is owned by Myanmar, and the
Myanmar Aerospace Engineering University (MAEU) in Meiktila was involved
in the project. However, the Hokkaido University group issued a
statement making excessively clear that only they controlled the
satellite and that they would only give Myanmar data under very limited
circumstances.

As of Mar 25 the ISS visiting vehicle list was:
 Zvezda aft:    Progress MS-14
 Pirs:          Progress MS-16
 Poisk:         Soyuz MS-17
 Rassvet:       -
 IDA-2/PMA-2:   Dragon C207 (Resilience)
 IDA-3/PMA-3:   -
 Unity nadir:   Cygnus NG-15 (S.S. Katherine Johnson)
 Harmony nadir: -


YG-31
-----

The Yaogan 31 hao 03 zu (YG-31 Group 03) cluster of three signals
intelligence satellites was launched on Feb 24; 04 zu (Group 04) was 
launched on Mar 13.  YG-31 Group 01 was launched in Apr 2018 and Group   
02 was launched on Jan 29 this year.


PSLV-C51
--------

ISRO and New Space India Ltd launched a PSLV-DL from Satish Dhawan Space Centre
on Feb 28. The PS4 upper stage placed INPE/Brazil's 637 kg Amazonia-1 imaging satellite
in a 750 km orbit, and then made two burns to lower orbit to 500 km where
it deployed a set of small satellites:

  Sindhu Netra is a 10 kg AIS (ship tracking) satellite built by PES University, Bengaluru for DRDO
  SDsat (Satish Dhawan Sat) is a 4 kg satellite from Space Kidz India
  Three 0.25U university cubesats which together comprise the UnitySat mission:
   JITSat (Jeppiaar Inst of Technology, Sriperumbudur);
   GHRCEsat (G.H. Raisoni College of Engineering, Nagpur);
   Sri Shakthi Sat (Sri Shakthi Inst. of Engineering and Technology, Coimbatore).
  SAI-1 Nanoconnect-2 is a 2U cubesat from UNAM (Mexico City); it will test a software-defined-radio
    unit from Space AI Inc (San Francisco).
  Spacebee 76 to 87, 0.25U IoT comms satellites for Swarm Tech (US).

Arktika-M
----------

On Feb 28 Russia launched a Soyuz-2-1B from Baykonur with the first
Arktika-M weather satellite. The satellite will be placed in Molniya
orbit. In addition to weather imagers the 2200 kg satellite, using the
Lavochkin Navigator bus, also carries a search and rescue communications
relay payload.

Starlink
---------

Starlink launches were carried out on Mar 4 (mission V1.0-L17, KSC LC39A), Mar 11 (V1.0-L20, Canaveral LC40),
Mar 14 (V1.0-L21, KSC LC39A) and Mar 24 (V1.0-L22, Canaveral LC40). Each launch placed 60
Starlinks in orbit. The first stages landed successfuly on the droneships; the Mar 11 launch used
the JRTI and the others used the OCISLY. The second stages were deorbited except for the Mar 4
launch where the stage remained in orbit.

Soyuz cluster launch
--------------------

On Mar 22 GK Launch Services carried out a Soyuz-2-1a launch from Baykonur with the South Korean
CAS500-1 imaging satellite and a cluster of small satellites. The satellites were placed 
in 2300 LTDN sun-synch orbit. The Fregat upper stage went to a 494 x 509 km orbit to deploy CAS500-1,
then made two further burns to go to a 579 x 604 km orbit to deploy four GRUS weather satellites
for Japan's AXELSPACE, and then two further burns to a lower 535 x 560 km orbit for deployment
of the remaining satellites:
  ELSA-d, the Astroscale experiment which will release a target satellite and recapture it using
    a magnetic plate;
  Najm-1, an imaging satellite for King Abdul Aziz City of Sci and Tech built by LinaSpace of Virginia;
  Unisat-7, a satellite from Rome's Gauss srl which will release a set of picosatellites;
  DMSat-1, a UTIAS_SFL Nemo-V1 class small imaging satellite for MBRSC in the UAE;
and a set of cubesats in deployers from Aerospace Capital (Moscow) and ISILaunch (Delft).

The first Aerospace Capital 4 x 3U deployer has ChallengeOne for Telnet
Holding (Tunis), Lacunasat-2b for Lacuna Space (Harwell, UK), 3B5GSat
for Sateliot (Barcelona) and three 1U sats: GRB-Alpha (TU Kosice),
WildTrackCube (Roma-Sapienza), and KSU-Cubesat (King Saud U.)

The second Aerospace Capital deployer has the 6U OrbiKraft-Zorkiy for
Sputniks (Moscow), and the 3U NIU VsHE-DZZ for the VsHE economics
college (Moscow) and Sirius-DZZ for OTs Sirius (Sochi)

ISILaunch has four 12U deployers. The first one has Kepler-6 and 7
(@KeplerComms, Toronto); 2nd has ADELIS-SAMSON 1 and 2 (Technion U,
Haifa); 3rd has ADELIS-SAMSON-3 and a mass dummy. All these are 6U.
The final ISILaunch deployer has NanoSatC-Br-2 (INPE-CRS, Santa Maria,
2U); KMSL (Chosun U, Gwangju, 3U); Hiber-3 (Hiber, Delft); Beesat
5,6,7,8 (TU Berlin, 4 x 0.25U); & CANYVAL-C (Yonsei U, Seoul) which is a
2U+1U formation flying expt; the 2U is called Pumbaa and the 1U Timon.

Unisat-7 from GAUSS srl (Rome) will deploy several small subsatellites:
BCCSAT-1 (Bangkok Christian Coll, 1U); FEES (GPAP, Gussago, Italy,
0.3U); DIY-1 (DIYSat, Buenos Aires, 1P); SMOG-1 (BUTE Budapest, 1P); and
STECCO (Roma Sapienza, 6P). A 1P sat is a 0.05m cube.

OSIRIS-REX
----------

The OSIRIS-REX asteroid probe left asteroid Bennu's Hill sphere on Oct 22, and at
the time it was planned to send it straight back to Earth. It's now been decided
to do a final flyby to inspect the asteroid's state following the sampling and departure.
On Jan 14, at a distance from Bennu of 2194 km, O-REX fired its engines to return
towards Bennu and at about 0200 UTC Mar 25 it returned to the Hill sphere (gravitational
sphere of influence). The flyby will be on Apr 6 at a distance of 4 km.
The departure burn to head back to Earth is now scheduled for May 10.

Errata
-------

In the previous issue I reported 36 SpaceBEE on Transporter 1 ESPA-port B2; there were only 24.
The other 12 SpaceBEEs on the launch were on ION-SVC, as noted further down in the list.
Those SpaceBEEs had apparently not yet been deployed from ION-SVC as of Mar 24.
Also, the Dove satellites on port C1 are Flock 4s, not Flock 4c - sorry about that typo.

Progress MS-16 docked with Pirs on Feb 17, not Feb 16.

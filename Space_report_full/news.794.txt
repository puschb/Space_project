International Space Station
---------------------------

The Dragon CRS-22 cargo ship docked at IDA-3 at 0909 UTC Jun 5.

On Jun 10 at 2249 UTC the Canadarm-2 extracted the IROSA solar array package from CRS-22's trunk.
At 0343 UTC Jun 11 the package was stowed on the POA (`Payload ORU Accommodation') on the station
truss' Mobile Base System. The MBS was later moved to worksite 8 at the end of the truss railway
to put the IROSA package nearer the P6 truss where the new arrays are to be installed.

CRS-22 delivered the Nanoracks NRCSD-20 package to ISS; the crew moved it to the Kibo module airlock and
on Jun 14 the Japanese RMS arm extracted NRCSD-20 from the airlock. Two cubesats, RamSat and SOAR,
were ejected from it at 0505 UTC Jun 14. NRCSD-20 was then placed back in the airlock. CRS-22
also delivered J-SSOD-17, as noted below.

RamSat is a 2U student satellite from Robertsville Middle School, Oak
Ridge, Tennessee. SOAR is a 3U cubesat from the University of Manchester
to study materials coatings and aerodynamics in lower LEO.

On Jun 16 astronauts Pesquet and Kimbrough made a spacewalk in suits
3009 and 3006 to attempt installation of IROSA array 2B, as US EVA-74.
The crew lost some time due to problems with Kimbrough's spacesuit, but
eventually removed array 2B from the IROSA launch package and attached
it to the support bracket at the base of the 2B array mast on truss
segment P6. However, they were unable to unfold the two halves of the
array cylinder and returned to the airlock with the array still in a
packed configuration.
 Quest was depressurized from 1204 to 1926 UTC and the hatch was open from 1210 to 1923 UTC.

On Jun 20 US EVA-75 saw the completion of 2B IROSA deployment. EVA-75
used spacesuits 3009 (Pesquet) and 3015 (Kimbrough) with SAFER units 13
and 15. The airlock was depressuized at 1135 UTC and repressurized at
1810 UTC (50 mbar level). The hatch was open from 1141 to 1807 UTC. EV1
was outside 1147 to 1755, EV2 from 1154 to 1745. The astronauts went on
to battery power at 1142 UTC and back to station power around 1805 UTC?.
The IROSA 2B array was unfolded at 1300 UTC and deployed from 1524 to
1535 UTC. The 2nd IROSA array, 4B, remained attached to the carrier on
the MBS POA until EVA-76.

On Jun 22 the Japanese RMS robot arm extracted the J-SSOD-17 deployer from the
Kibo airlock. J-SSOD-17 was delivered to ISS on CRS-22. At 1055 UTC the deployer
ejected MIR-SAT1, a 1U cubesat from the Mauritius Research and Innovation Council
sponsored by the UN KiboCube program. 

A second satellite was deployed a few hours later (actual time unknown).
It was described only as a 'business satellite'. We don't know the owner
or even which country licences the satellite. In the Space-Track
database it is called 'BD-28', which I suspect is a designation from
JAXA's commercial cubesat integrator SpaceBD, which probably managed the
integration and flight, and not the name that the owner gave the
satellite. SpaceTrack marks the satellite as being a US one, but it's not clear
where they get that information.

On Jun 25 Pesquet and Kimbrough carried out US EVA-76 to install the 4B IROSA
array on the 4B mod kit at P6. The airlock was depressurized at 1145 UTC and
repressurized at 1837 UTC. Hatch open/close was 1151 to 1833 UTC; astronauts
went on battery pwer at 1152 UTC. The 4B IROSA was removed from the carrier
at 1410 UTC and soft docked to the mod kit on P6 at 1550 UTC. Array deployment
was complete at 1755 UTC.

On Jun 29 the Canadarm-2 unberthed the S.S.Katherine Johnson (Cygnus NG-15) from
the Unity module and at 1632 UTC released it into orbit. At 2250 UTC the IT-SPINS and MySat-2
cubesats were deployed from the Nanoracks NRCSD-E deployer on NG-15.

On Jun 29 the Progress MS-17 cargo ship (spacecraft 7K-TGM No. 446) was launched from Baykonur.
It is scheduled to dock with the Poisk module.

SXM-8
-----

On Jun 6 SpaceX launched the SXM-8 digital radio broadcasting satellite
for Sirius XM. Launch mass of the satellite is approximately 7000 kg.
The F9 first stage landed on the droneship JRTI. SXM-8 and the F9 second
stage were placed in a 235 x 19384 km transfer orbit. SXM-8 was on station
in geostationary orbit at 120.5W by Jun 22.


CZ-2D
-----

The first of the Beijing-3 series of imaging satellites was launched from Taiyuan by a SAST CZ-2D
on Jun 11. The satellite is operated by 21st Century Aerospace Technology of Beijing.
The Beijing-1 satellite was built for them by Surrey Satellite and launched in 2005.
21AT also leased the capacity of the DMC-3 satellites from Surrey, launched in 2015, and branded
the data as Beijing-2.

TacRL-2
-------

The first US Space Force Tactical Responsive Launch, TacRL-2, flew successfully on Jun 13, placing 
the Odyssey satellite in orbit. The Northrop Grumman L-1011 Stargazer aircraft took off
from runway 30/12 at Vandenberg Space Force Base at about 0710 UTC and headed out over the California
coast. At 0811 UTC the airplane dropped its Pegasus XL launch vehicle at about 123.5W 35.3N.
The Pegasus first stage ignited 5 seconds later and after about 8 minutes stage 3 burnout left
the third stage and the Odyssey satellite in sun-synchronous orbit with a 23:43 local time descending node. 

Odyssey is a satellite dedicated to `space domain awareness', which is US military jargon for 
tracking other satellites and space debris.

NROL-111
---------

On Jun 15 Northrop Grumman launched a Minotaur 1 rocket from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport
at Wallops Island, Virginia on the NROL-111 launch mission for the US National Reconnaissance Office.
Three small satellites were placed in low Earth orbit. Their mission is not known; I am labelling them
as communications for now but that's a very low confidence guess.

Shenzhou 12
-----------

China's first human spaceflight launch in over 4 years took off on Jun 17. The CZ-2F placed Shenzhou 12
in orbit on its way to a rendezvous with the Tianhe/Tianzhou-2 complex.

Crew of Shenzhou 12 are Nie Haipeng, Liu Boming and Tang Honbo. The spaceship docked with the forward
port of the Tianhe module at 0754 UTC. The mission is scheduled to last three months.

GPS
----

The fifth GPS Block III navigation satellite was launched on Jun 17. The
first stage of the Falcon 9 launch vehicle landed on the droneship JRTI;
the second stage made two burns to  place the GPS satellite in transfer
orbit and then made a third burn to deorbit the stage southeast of South
Africa. By Jun 25 GPS III SV05 was in a 21068 x 21098 km x 55.0 deg orbit.

Yaogan 30 Group 09
-------------------

The 9th triplet of Yaogan 30 (also called Chuangxin-5) satellites was
launched from Xichang on Jun 18. There are now 27 Yaogan-30 satellites
in orbit; they are thought to be a signals intelligence constellation
although a communications role also seems possible.

A secondary payload, the Tianqi-14 commercial IoT data relay satellite
for Guodian Gaokeji, was also deployed.  The CZ-2C second stage carried
out propellant depletion venting while tumbling, resulting in one of the
notorious spiral clouds being observed under its ground track in New Caledonia
and Vanuatu.

Iranian launch failure
----------------------

US government sources have confirmed that Iran attempted an orbital
launch of the Simorgh rocket from the Khomeini launch complex at the
Semnan spaceport on Jun 12, but the launch failed in some way. This is
the 4th failed orbital attempt of the rocket (there was also a 2016 test
launch that may not have been intended to reach orbit).

There are some indications there may have been a second failed launch
on Jun 23.

Pion-NKS
--------

The Russian Defense Ministry launched its first Pion NKS naval
electronic intelligence satellite, Pion-NKS No. 901, on Jun 25. The
6.5-tonne spacecraft was developed by KB Arsenal (St-Peterburg) and
TsSKB-Progress (Samara). It will probably raise perigee and circularize
orbit on Jun 26.


Erratum
-------

In the text of JSR793 the May 15 Starlink launch was misstated as being on May 9.

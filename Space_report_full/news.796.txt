International Space Station
---------------------------

Expedition 65 continues.

The Nauka module made a 15m/s orbit raising burn on Jul 22. Further
orbit raising burns left it in a 334 x 406 km orbit by Jul 25, with the
initial propulsion system problems resolved.

On Jul 26 at 1055 UTC the docked Progress MS-16/Pirs complex undocked
from the nadir port of the Zvezda module. Pirs had been attached to
Zvezda since 2001. At 1401 UTC Progress MS-16 performed a 120 m/s
deorbit burn and the 9-tonne Progress MS-16/Pirs reentered the
atmosphere over the South Pacific at 1442 UTC, with debris reaching the
ocean surface at 1452 UTC.

Nauka successfully docked with the Zvezda nadir port at 1329 UTC Jul 29.
Oleg Novitskiy was within seconds of taking over manual TORU remote
control for the final 10 metres of the approach, as the automatic system
was experiencing some oscillations in alignment, but according to a
report by Anatoliy Zak the issue straightened itself out just in time
and automatic docking was allowed to run to completion. 

Nauka's adventures were not over At 1645 UTC the Nauka thrusters began
unexpectedly firing, threatening loss of attitude control for the ISS.
The Zvezda and Progress MS-17 thrusters tried to counteract the unwanted
torque, but ISS tumbled until Nauka's propellant was depleted and the
other modules could restore attitude. Note that initial reports of a
mere 45 degree attitude deviation were superseded; one flight controller
commented `we [i.e. ISS] proceeded to do headstands and cartwheels.
Olympic judges would be proud' and reported that the station made 1.5
full rotations in pitch before being brought under control. However, by
around 1800 UTC the situation on ISS was stable. Hatches to Nauka were
opened on Jul 30.

On Aug 10 Northrop Grumman launched the Cygnus NG-16 cargo ship S.S.
Ellison Onizuka. The Onizuka arrived at ISS on Aug 12, with Canadarm-2
grappling it at 1007 UTC and berthing it on the nadir Unity CBM at 1342
UTC. NG-16 carries another IROSA mod kit for installation on the truss.
PIRPL, an infrared sensor payload from the US  military Space
Development Agency and Missile Defense Agency, is attached externally to
the Cygnus PCM and will be operated after Cygnus leaves the ISS.

Language Change and Civilian Astronauts: A Rant
------------------------------------------------

In general, language change is inevitable. Specific changes,
however, are not - especially when those changes are instigated
by one individual or group with an agenda. Sometimes it's
a good thing: in my lifetime I have seen widespread adoption
of deliberate changes to make English less sexist. I applaud,
endorse and adopt those changes. However, "language changes
are inevitable" is not a good reason to roll over and accept
bad changes without a fight.

  In that sprit, I oppose the proposed change to the dictionary meaning
of the word 'civilian', and the phrase 'civilian astronaut' proposed by
SpaceX and the Inspiration Four team. 'Civilian astronaut' means
'not active military'; the first all-civilian orbital space crew was
that of Soyuz TMA-3 in 2003, with Aleksandr Kaleri, Mike Foale and Pedro
Duque. The first civilian in space was NASA's Joe Walker (on the X-15,
1963); the first in orbit was Dr. Konstantin Feoktistov (Voskhod 1,
1964); and the first American civilian in orbit was Neil Armstrong
(Gemini 8, 1966). At the time of Apollo 11 the US press made a big deal
of the fact that the first lunar mission was commanded by a civilian, so
the term 'civilian astronaut' has an important history in the politics
of astronautics.
 
  A correct term for a space traveller who is not a government employee
is `private astronaut'. Other terms, e.g. private-citizen astronaut, are
also correct. 'Civilian astronaut' is not correct when used as a term
meant to exclude NASA astronauts or other government astronauts.
Non-military government employees are also civilians, and attempting to
change the language to say that they aren't is pernicious and stupid. I
call on journalists, editors, keepers of style guides, and all users of
the English language to consider this proposed new usage incorrect and
to rigorously avoid using it themselves.

The Inspiration Four crew, if they launch as planned, will be the first
all-private-citizen orbital space crew. It will also be an all-civilian, 
but NOT the first all-civilian, orbital space crew.


Yunhai 1-02 collision
---------------------

At 0741 UTC on Mar 18 an event happened on China's Yunhai 1-02 satellite
that resulted in the generation of a cloud of orbital debris, although
the satellite continued to operate after the event. It has now become
clear that the source of the event was a collision with a small Russian
debris object. Object 48078, 1996-051Q, is associated with the Zenit
second stage from the 1996 Kosmos-2333 launch. The object was cataloged
on around Mar 25 and only a single orbital solution, with epoch Mar 16,
is associated with it. Using this orbit and the TLEs for Yunhai 1-02, I
infer that the two objects were within 1 km of each other at 0741:19 UTC
over 19.4E 70.9N, 780 km above Tromso, Norway, travelling at a relative
velocity of 13.26 km/s. In August Space-Track added a comment to the 
object 48078 catalog entry: "Collided with satellite", implicitly confirming
that the Yunhai debris event was a collision. SpaceForce has since
confirmed this interpretation.


Rocket Lab
----------

Electron mission 21 was launched from New Zealand on Jul 29, placing the
US Air Force Research Lab's Monolith (STP-27RM) satellite in orbit.
Monolith will test the ability of a cubesat to stably deploy an external
sensor whose size is comparable to the satellite.

Tianhui 1-04
------------

China's SAST launched a CZ-2D on Jul 29 placing the TH1-04 mapping
satellite in orbit.

Ariane VA254
-------------

Following a redesign of the nose fairing, Ariane 5 returned to flight on Jul 30 with the
launch of flight VA254 (probably vehicle 5113?) carrying the Star One D2 and Eutelsat Quantum
satellites to geotransfer orbit.

KLEO
----

Two Ka-band communications test satellites for the German company KLEO
Connect, KL-Beta A and B, were launched by CZ-6 from Taiyuan on Aug 4.


Transporter-2
--------------

The D-Orbit ION SVC-03 'Dauntless David' released two more of its passengers on
Jul 21 and Jul 22:  Reaktor's W-Cube to test W-band propagation and Endurosat's SPARTAN
with a variety of experiments. The final payload, Neptuno, was released on Jul 24.

Most of the Transporter-2 objects have now been identified; PACE-1, PAINANI-2 and Faraday
Phoenix are still unclaimed.

The 11 kg Echostar EG-3 cubesat, built by Tyvak and owned by Echostar
Australia, raised its orbit from 523 x 537 km to 642 x 655 km on Jul
16-17. This is the largest orbit change performed by a cubesat, using a
new propulsion system from the California-based company Stellar
Exploration with 6.5 kg of hydrazine and eight 0.25N hydrazine thrusters
(four axial and four attitude, so 1N total nominal axial thrust). The
company reports a 65 m/s delta-V, which is consistent with my own
estimate of the delta-V required for this orbit change.

SQX-1
-----

China's Xingji Rongyao Kongjian Keji YG (iSpace, or Interstellar Glory
Space Tech Ltd) launched the third Shuang Quxian 1 (Hyperbola-1) orbital
vehicle from Jiuquan on Aug 3, but it apparently failed to reach its
target 500 km, 1400 LTDN sun-synchronous orbit due to the failure of the payload fairing to
separate. A final velocity of 7400 m/s has been reported which would
imply impact in Antarctica.

Payload on the vehicle is suspected to have been the 18 kg Jilin-1 Mofang-01A
imaging satellite for Changguang Satellite Tech but this is not yet
confirmed.

ZX-2E
-----

China's CALT launched a CZ-3B to geotransfer orbit on Aug 5, carrying the Shentong 2-05
military communications satellite, which has the cover name Zhongxing-2E (ZX-2E).

EOS-03
------

EOS-03, a 2268 kg I2K-class satellite with a hyperspectral imaging payload, was lost on Aug 12 when the cryogenic
third stage of India's GSLV Mk II rocket tumbled out of control shortly after ignition. The vehicle fell
in the Andaman Sea near 96E 9N.

Vega VV19
---------

The Arianespace Vega rocket carried out a successful flight VV19 on Aug 17, deploying the Airbus imaging
satellite Pleiades Neo 4 to a 623 km orbit and then four cubesats to a 560 km orbit:
BRO-4 for Unseen Labs, LEDSAT for U. Roma La Sapienza, Sunstorm for Reaktor Space, and Radcube
for Hungarian company C3S. 

Tianhui 2
---------

On Aug 18 China's SAST launched a CZ-4B with two radar mapping satellites, Tianhui 2 hao 02 zu 01 and 02 zing
(Tianhui Type 2 Group 02 Sats 01 and 02). The satellites carry X-band SAR radars with 3 metre resolution.


Tiangong space station
----------------------

Astronauts Nie and Liu made a spacewalk on Aug 20, deploying a camera, installing an
external pump, and carrying out further tests of the robot arm. The hatch was open
from 0038 to 0633 UTC.

OneWeb
------

34 more OneWeb satellites were launched from Baykonur on Aug 21.

Note: I have added a new set of lists on my website covering various aspects of
human spaceflight. See http://planet4589.org/space/astro/web/index.html

International Space Station
---------------------------

Expedition 65 continues under the command of Thomas Pesquet (ESA). Flight engineers are
Shane Kimbrough (NASA), Megan McArthur (NASA), Akihiko Hoshide (JAXA), Oleg Novitsky (Roskosmos),
Pyotr Dubrov (Roskosmos), Mark Vande Hei (NASA) and Anton Shkaplerov (Roskomos). These eight
are currently accompanied by the visiting film crew Shipenko and Peresild for a total of 10 people
on ISS. For a couple of minutes during the NS-18 suborbital flight there were a total of 14 people
in space. This equalled the record set during Inspiration 4, when its four crew were supplemented
by three on Shenzhou 12 and seven on ISS.

Soyuz MS-18 undocked from the Rassvet module at 1221:36 UTC Sep 28 and redocked with Nauka at 1304:15 UTC,
inaugurating Nauka's SSVP docking adatper.

Cargo ship Dragon CRS-23 undocked from the IDA-2 port at 1312 UTC Sep 30. It lowered
its orbit at about 1708 UTC to 253 x 406 km, and made its deorbit
burn at 0207 UTC Oct 1, landing off the coast of Florida at about 80.6W 29.8N at roughly 0257 UTC.
The trunk was ejected a few minutes before deorbit and remains in the 253 x 406 km orbit.

Soyuz MS-19 was launched on Oct 5 at 0855 UTC, carrying commander Anton Shkaplerov
and two passengers, movie director Klim Shipenko and actor Yulia
Peresild. The ship docked at the Rassvet module at 1222 UTC the same day.

On Oct 6 the Japanese RMS removed the J-SSOD-19 deployer from the Kibo airlock,
and J-SSOD-19 ejected two Australian and two Phillipine cubesats.

Oct Oct 12 the Japanese RMS removed the Nanoracks NRCSD-21 deployer from the Kibo
Airlock. NRCSD-21 deployed the cubesats CAPSAT, SPACE HAUC and PR-CUNAR2.

Chinese Space Station
-----------------------

The Tianzhou 2 cargo ship undocked from the aft port of the Tianhe
module at 0225 UTC Sep 18, and redocked with the forward port, vacated
by Shenzhou 12 two days earlier. China reported the process lasted
`about 4 hours', which I assume means redocking sometime prior to 0630
UTC.

The Tianzhou 3 cargo ship was launched at 0710 UTC Sep 20 and docked with the aft port
of Tianhe at 1408 UTC the same day. 

Inspiration4
------------

The Dragon trunk ejected from Inspiration4 is being tracked in a 360 x 369 km x 51.7 deg orbit.

Jilin-1 GF02D
-------------

EXPACE launched a Kuaizhou-1A rocket from Jiuquan on Sep 27 with Changuang Weixing Jishu's Jilin-1 Gaofen 02D
high resolution imaging satellite. This is a return to flight of the KZ-1A following its Sep 2020 launch failure
with Jilin-1 Gaofen 02C.

Shiyan 10
---------

CALT launched a Chang Zheng 3B from Xichang on Sep 27 with the Shiyan 10
test satellite Two objects were cataloged in a 51 degree inclination
geotransfer orbit. After a long delay, China announced that although the
rocket had followed the correct trajectory, the Shiyan 10 payload itself
had failed during the ascent.

Landsat 9
-----------

The Landsat 9 imaging satellite was launched on Sep 27. The satellite is
similar to Landsat 8 and is built by Northrop Grumman (former Spectrum
Astro/Gilbert). It has optical, near and mid infrared imagers.

The Centaur also carried the ESPA Flight System  (EFS), an ESPA ring fixed between the Centaur
and Landsat carrying several cubesat dispensers. EFS ejected four 6U cubesats:
  Cesium Astro's CS1 and CS2, for intersatellite communication experiments in partnership with the US Defense
   Department's Defense Innovation Unit.
  The University of Colorado's CUTE (Cubesat UV Transit Experiment) to study exoplanet atmospheres
  Boston University's CUPID with a soft X-ray telescope to study charge exchange emission from the
   interaction of the solar wind with the Earth's exosphere. This emission is a frequent annoyance
   to X-ray astronomers likeme as it is a hard-to-predict contribution to the background noise in our images
   in telescopes like Chandra.


Chang'e-5
---------

The Chang'e-5 orbiter, which made a 16500 km lunar flyby on Sep 12 after returning from
Sun-Earth L1, looks likely to make a further lunar encounter on Nov 17.

Rant on Registration
---------------------


The US government needs to improve its procedure for  generating the
list of its satellites that it registers with the UN.
This will be a long, ranty, thread.

Since the start of the space age it has been standard practice
that all Earth satellite launches, even `secret' ones, have been
publicly announced.

In 1962, around the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis,  the US was
alarmed when it discovered the USSR had launched several unannounced
satellites into low orbit. Were they, perhaps, orbital nukes? No, it
turned out, they were failed interplanetary probes. Nevertheless this
reinforced the idea that unannounced launches were a bad idea.

Relatedly, a UN register of space objects was established;
UN Resolution 1721B and, later, the UN Registration Convention
came into force. The US has mostly, but not perfectly, complied
with the requirements of the convention.


Recently there's been a new problem in the US registrations. The
registration documents are clearly generated from the US satellite
catalog maintained by SpaceForce 18SPCS. This is not good enough. Why?

Let's look at an example - the Electron 4 mission of Dec 2018, launch
2018-104. This placed 11 United States payloads in orbit, and two New Zealand
rocket stages. All 13 objects are being tracked by Space Force,
and we know which 2 objects are the rocket stages. 
So, we have 11 tracked objects that we know are the 11 US payloads.

But, for 5 of these payloads we don't know which object is which.
Tracked objects E, F, K, L and P are the satellites
Ceres, RSat, Cubesail, Albus and NMTSat in some order, but we don't
know which order. In the US satellite catalog, catalog numbers
corresponds to objects being tracked, and they only get a name associated
with them if Space Force knows what the tracked object is.
So, if you search for the NASA 'Albus' satellite or the New Mexico Tech 'NMTSat'
in the satellite catalog you won't
find anything. If you count the number of US payloads launched in 2018,
these won't be included and you'll get too low an answer.

More recently, there are the V-R3X payloads from launch 2021-006
which aren't even identified as US objects in the catalog, even though
we know they are objects BC, BG and DQ in some order. So, they are not
included in US registration document ST/SG/SER.E/977 - but they should be.

This is (arguably) not Space Force's fault. It's their catalog and  this
is what works for them, I guess. BUT:  the requirement on the State
Dept. for UN registration is NOT 'tell me which of your satellites you
are tracking'. It's 'tell me which satellites you have put in orbit'. So
it is NOT OK for them to use the satcat as a complete list for this
purpose - because it is not OK for them to leave out satellites like
Albus just because we don't know
which catalog number it is. We know the US launched Albus and it is in orbit,
so it should be registered with the UN. I would argue the same is true of the Thinsats
deployed from Cygnus even though SpaceForce decided they weren't going to bother
cataloging them at all because they reentered after a few days. They met the usual
criterion for registration with the UN and should be registered.

This used not to be a big problem because very few launched US payloads were
not identified with a catalog number. But now with all these cluster cubesat
launches, it's much more common. I estimate there are 28 unregistered US satellites
in 2018, and 9 in 2019, although only 1 in 2020. There look to be a bunch in 2021
but not all the reg documents are in yet.

One possibility is that Space-Track could maintain a separate public table of
object information versus launch number for objects known to be in orbit
but not associated with a catalog number.

It shouldn't be too hard to do better. I keep a list of the unregistered
satellites on my website (objects marked [US] in square parentheses in
https://planet4589.org/space/gcat/data/cat/psatcat.html If one person
can do this in his spare time, it seems like the US government should be
able to manage it. Do better, America!  End of rant.

-----------

The ESA/JAXA BepiColombo probe flew past Mercury on Oct 1. It entered Mercury's
gravitational sphere at 1427 UTC Oct 1, made closest approach of 196 km altitude
at 2336 UTC, and departed the gravitational sphere at 0845 UTC Oct 2.


Errata
------
  
- FPMU is the Floating Potential Measurement Unit
- Initial inclination of Inspiration 4 is 51.6 deg (not km!)
- Correct spelling of the Inspiration 4 medical officer's surname is Arceneaux.
These have been amended in the archival version of the report.

Note: I have added a new set of lists on my website covering various aspects of
human spaceflight. See http://planet4589.org/space/astro/web/index.html

International Space Station
---------------------------

Expedition 65 concluded on Oct 17 with the undocking of Soyuz MS-18 and the beginning
of Expedtion 66.

Soyuz MS-18 undocked fromm Nauka at 0114:00 UTC Oct 17 with Novitskiy,
Shipenko and Peresild; the ship landed in Kazakhstan at 0435:44 UTC
according to Roskosmos.

The Progress MS-17 cargo ship undocked from Poisk at 2342 UTC Oct 20, retreated over
100 km, and performed a re-rendezvous to redock with Nauka at 0421 UTC Oct 22.

Progress MS-18 was launched on Oct 28. It docked with the aft port on
Zvezda at 0131:19 UTC Oct 30.

On Nov 6 Anton Shkaplerov took command of ISS from Thomas Pesquet, prior
to the latter's return to Earth on Crew-2.

Dragon Crew-2 'Endeavour' undocked from IDA-3 at 1905 UTC Nov 8 with
astronauts Kimbrough, McArthur, Hoshide and Pesquet. It jettisoned its
trunk at 0235 UTC Nov 9 into a 406 x 412 km orbit and performed a
deorbit burn at 0239 UTC, landing  off the coast of Pensacola, Florida
at 0333 UTC Nov 9, at about 87.5W 29.8N.

Dragon Crew-3 'Endurance' (capsule C210) was launched on Nov 11 carrying
Raj Chari (Cdr), Tom Marshburn (Pilot), Matthais Maurer (Mission
Specialist 1) and Kayla Barron (Mission Specialist 2). During the launch
Maurer became the 600th person in space (as usual, I use 80 km as the
defining boundary and assign numbers in the `crew rank' order as given
in this paragraph). Endurance docked with the Station's IDA-2 port at
2332 UTC Nov 11.



Chinese Space Station
----------------------

Shenzhou 13 was launched on Oct 15, carrying Zhai Zhigang, Wang Yaping and Yu Guangfe.
It docked with the nadir docking port on Tianhe at 2248 UTC the same day, beginning
the second expedition aboard the Chinese space station.

On Nov 7 from about 1051 to about 1701 UTC astronauts Zhai and Wang made a spacewalk,
testing out the robot arm and installing a grapple fixture on it.

Chinese orbital weapon test
---------------------------

The Financial Times quotes unnamed US government sources as revealing
that China launched a missile sometime in August that placed a reentry
vehicle (RV) in Earth orbit. The RV completed slightly less than one
orbit and was deorbited for impact at an unspecified location (probably
in China). This is a technique tested by the USSR in the 1960s and
called `Fractional Orbital Bombardment System' (FOBS) by the US defense
community.

Space Force did not catalog any objects from the mission and it did not receive an 
international designation. I am assigning it the `uncataloged' designation 2021-U01
in my system in GCAT (https://planet4589.org/space/gcat/).

A denial from China implied that the Chinese think what is being referred to is
the spaceplane test on Jul 16. At the time we thought it was a short range test,
but as Marco Langbroek points out it might have been an one-orbit test where the
landing was geographically not far from the takeoff. However, Chinese statements
at the time described the test as suborbital, and a more recent FT statement
specifies that the alleged FOBS launch was on Jul 27. (A second `hypersonic'
test the new FT story mentions, on Aug 13, was not specified to be orbital.)

The launch vehicle is suspected to have been a CZ-2C, and Chinese
statements indicate that the Jul 19 and Aug 24 CZ-2C launches were the
76th and 78th of the kind respectively, implying a launch between those
two dates, consistent with the Jul 27 date. The earlier FT report also
cites the US sources as saying the missile missed its target by 'two
dozen miles', No upper stage was left in orbit, so the perigee was probably
within the atmosphere or not much above it.

Properties of the mission:  
   Launch date: 2021 Jul 27
   Launch vehicle; CZ-2C?
   Launch site: Taiyuan?
   Impact site: Unknown
   Orbit: Unknown: possibly around 60-100 x 200 km?
   Inclination: Unknown - probably 97 deg?

Lucy
----

The Lucy asteroid probe was launched on Oct 16. Lucy is a NASA Discovery
program mission built by Lockheed Martin/Denver and the mission is
operated by NASA-Goddard with the science team headed by Hal Levison of
SwRI.  The spacecraft has a mass of 1550 kg wet, 821 kg dry and its large circular
solar panels give it a span of 15.8 metres. It has a Nammo-Westcott (UK) Leros-1c
bipropellant MON/hydrazine main engine with a 458N thruster. Lucy carries
the L'LORRI imager, the L'Ralph-LEISA imaging IR spectrometer, the L'Ralpha-MVIC
high resolution camera and the L'TES thermal infrared spectrometer.

Lucy left the Sun-Earth Hill sphere at 1250 UTC Oct 19 to enter a 0.84 x
1.16 AU x 0.2 deg solar orbit. It will reach aphelion on Jan 26 and
return to Earth for a 300 km flyby a year after launch, on 2022 Oct 16.
This will put Lucy in a 0.85 x 2.24 AU x 0.0 deg solar orbit which sets
it up for a second Earth flyby on 2024 Dec 13. That flyby will boost the
probe to a 0.96 x 5.75 AU x 4.4 deg solar orbit with a 2027 aphelion at
the Sun-Jupiter L4 (SJL4) Lagrange point, where Lucy will fly past
several of the Jupiter L4 Trojan asteroids. Returning to the vicinity of
Earth at perihelion on 2030 Dec 27, a further Earth gravity assist will
target it to a 0.95 x 5.63 AU x 10.7 deg orbit on track for Sun-Jupiter
L5 and a 2033 visit to the region of the L5 Trojans.

Lucy's planned asteroid flybys, mostly at a nominal distance of about
1000 km, are:

Nuri
----

South Korea's KSLV-2 (Nuri) satellite launch vehicle made its first
flight on Oct 21 from Naro Space Center.  Nuri is a three-stage
LOX/kerosene rocket and for this flight carried a dummy satellite with a
mass of 1500 kg, targeting a 700 km circular sun-synchronous orbit. The
third stage fired to depletion but had an underspeed of 800 m/s, and
failed to reach orbit. After passing through a roughly 740 km apogee the
third stage and the  successfully-separated payload fell back to reenter
south of Australia about 30 minutes after launch. The mission
demonstrated successful operation of the first, second, and (to some
extent) third stages as well as all separation systems (including
fairing and payload), so although a failure this flight was a very good
first attempt.

South Korea's previous KSLV-1 launch vehicle used a Russian first stage,
so Nuri is its first truly domestically produced orbital launch vehicle.

Ariane 5
--------

Arianespace launched an Ariane 5 on Oct 24 placing two communications satellites
in geotransfer orbit. SES-17 is a 6411 kg Thales Alenia Spacebus Neo200 for SES
with Ka-band service to the Americas and the Atlantic. Syracuse 4A is
a 3852 kg Thales Alenia Spacebus Neo100 for DGA, the French defense agency,
with X-band and Ka-band communications payloads. Both satellites have
electric (ion) propulsion systems; SES-17 with SPT-140 and Syracuse 4A with PPS-5000 thrusters.

Shi Jian 21
-----------

A SAST/Shanghai satellite reported to be studying orbital debris remediation technology
was launched on a CALT/Beijing CZ-3B rocket from Xichang on Oct 24. The satellite was
given the code name Shi Jian 21. The satellite reached geosynchronous orbit and
released a second object, which the US Space Force have labelled as an apogee kick motor
and I call a subsatellite.
As of Nov 4, the two objects were drifting at 1 degree west per day over the Pacific.
On Nov 13 SJ-21 braked slightly, reducing drift rate from 1.05 to 1.01 degrees a day.

Yaogan 32
----------

The Group 2 (02 zu) Yaogan-32 satellites were launched on Nov 3. The pair of presumed signals
intelligence satellites were placed in the 14:00 local time plane, joining the Group 1 satellites
launched in Oct 2018 to the 09:00 plane.


QZS-1R
------

QZS-1R, the fifth Quasi-Zenith Satellite (Michibiki) GPS regional
augmentation satellite, was launched on Oct 26 by a Mitsubishi Heavy
Industries H-IIA from Tanegashima. The satellite, built by Mitsubishi
Electric, is owned by the Japanese government and will be operated in
inclined synchronous orbit. The orbit was circularized on Oct 28
and as of Nov 13 the satellite was in a 32653 x 38947 km x 34.0 deg
orbit.


After launch the satellite was given the name `Michibiki Shogoki
Kokei-Ki'  (Michibiki Vehicle 1 Successor).

SDGSAT
------

On Nov 3 China launched a satellite it calls Guangmu Diqiu Kexue
Weixing (Wide-Eye Earth Science Satellite) for the Chinese Academy
of Sciences. In English it refers to the satellite as SDGSAT-1
(Sustainable Development Goals Satellite). The satellite carries
Earth remote sensing imagers.

Yaogan 35
---------

On Nov 6 China's SAST launched a CZ-2D with three Yaogan-35 satellites to
a 500 km, 35 degree inclination orbit.
Yaogan 35 A and B are built by DFH Satellite (Beijing) and 35C was built
by SAST (Shanghai). Mission of the satellites is not yet clear; it is possible
that A and B are imaging satellites and C is a radar satellite.

Starlink
---------

53 more Starlinks were launched on Nov 13 as Group 4-1. The Group 4 satellites are targeted
to a 540 km, 53.2 deg operational orbit.


Shiyan 10
---------

Reports of the Shiyan-10 satellite's death appear to have been
premature. A series of small orbit raising burns occurred between Oct 15
and Oct 18. The satellite is now in a 1090 x 40107 km x 51.1 deg orbit.

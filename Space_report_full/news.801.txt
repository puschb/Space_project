International Space Station
---------------------------

Expedition 66 continues.

On Dec 2 astronauts Marshburn and Barron carried out spacewalk US EVA-78, to replace the SASA
antenna on the P1 truss. The airlock was depressurized from 1108 to 1747 UTC; the hatch
was open from 1114 to 1743 UTC. The SASA (S-band Antenna SubAssembly) units are about 116 kg each;
there are three installed on S1, P1 and Z1 and a further two spares on the ELC-3 carrier.
During the spacewalk, the astronauts removed the P1 SASA unit and swapped it with one of the
spares on ELC-3.

On Dec 8 Roskosmos launched Soyuz MS-20 with commander Aleksandr Misurkin and spaceflight
participants (tourists) Maezawa Yusaku and Hirano Yozo. Soyuz MS-20 docked with Poisk
at 1340 UTC Dec 8. The three visitors returned on the same ship, undocking at 2350 UTC
Dec 19 and landing in Kazakhstan at 0313 UTC Dec 20.

On Dec 21 SpaceX launched the Dragon CRS-24 cargo ship  (also called mission SpX-24).
This mission uses capsule C209 on its second flight.
In the Dragon trunk are two Space Force payloads in the Space Test Program, STP-H7 and
STP-H8. STP-H7 will be installed on an external platform on the Columbus module
and STP-H8 will go to the Kibo Exposed Facility (I don't know which EFU). Combined mass
of STP-H7 and STP-H8 is 908 kg.

Inside the Dragon capsule are two cubesat deployer payloads:
 NRCSD-22, from Nanoracks, contains
   DAILI - Aerospace Corp, 1x6U cubesat for ionospheric research
   FEES 2 - GP Advanced Projects (Brescia), 0.3U cubesat
   GASPACS - Utah State U. 1U cubsat to test a deployable boom for attitude control
   PATCOOL - KSC/U Florida 3U cubesat to test thermal coatings and a drag device
   TARGIT - a 3U cubesat from Georgia Tech with a lidar (laser ranger) and a target subsatellite.
      The 4.5 kg cubesat will deploy the 1.5 kg subsatellite on a 6 m tether; the subsatellite
      has a 1-meter-sized inflatable Mylar tetrahedral balloon. The lidar will be used to
      image the subsatellite. The tether will be deployed after TARGIT's altitude decays below that
      of the Chinese space station.
 J-SSOD-20 (serial number to be confirmed), from Mitsui Bussan Aerospace, carries
   GT-1, a 1U amateur radio satellite from Georgia Tech, 
   Light-1, a 3U satellite to study terrestrial gamma-ray lightning flashes from NYU Abu Dhabi and Khalifa U.,
   and one further so-far-unidentified 1U cubesats, likely from Japanese companies.

CRS-24 is thought to also be carrying a new EMU spacesuit, but I haven't been able to find
out the serial number.

Dragon CRS-24 docked to IDA-2 on the Harmony module at 0841 UTC Dec 22.

At 2303 UTC on Dec 22 the Progress M-UM tug undocked from the Prichal
module (which it delivered to the ISS on Nov 26). Progress M-UM was then
deorbited with reentry over the South Pacific at 0430 UTC Dec 23.

Chinese Space Station
----------------------

On Dec 26 astronauts Ye and Zhai made a spacewalk to deploy an external camera platform.
The Tianhe airlock hatch was open from 1044 to 1655 UTC.

Starlink
--------

48 Starlink satellites were launched from Cape Canaveral on Dec 2 as
Group 4-3. The launch also deployed two BlackSky Global imaging
satellites.

52 Starlinks were launched on Dec 18 as Group 4-4. The launch southeast from Vandenberg
to 53 degrees was the lowest-inclination ever from the site.

Galileo
-------

Two more European Union navigation satellites in the Galileo series were launched on Dec 5.
GalileoSat-27/28 are FOC flight models 23/24.

Gushenxing-1
------------

The second launch of the Gushenxing-1 (Ceres-1) rocket placed five satellites in orbit:
  - Tianjun Daxue 1 built by Changguang Satellite for Tianjin University, with an IR imager;
  - Lize-1 and Baoyun  from Tianyi Research
  - Jin Zijing 5, an imaging satellite built by Zhongke Xingrui for Hong Kong Aerospace Tech
  - Jin Zijing 1-03, an imaging satellite built by Lingzhong Kongjian (Zero Gravity Lab) for Hong Kong Aerospace Tech.
Gushenxing-1 is a commercial launch vehicle developed by Xinghe Dongli Kongkian Keji YG (Galactic Energy) of 
Beijing.

STP-3
-----

The US Space Force's Space Test Program 3 mission was launched on a ULA Atlas V on Dec 7 to
near-synchronous orbit. The main payload was the STPSAT-6 satellite. A modified ESPA ring,
the LDPE-1 (Rooster 1) satellite, was also put in orbit; it will deploy a number of smaller
satellites including the 12U ASCENT cubesat from AFRL. 

An additional object (50214 / 2021-118D ) from the launch was cataloged on Dec 20; Space-Track records it as 
'Atlas Centaur 5 Debris' but it's possible it is the first of these subsatellites.

Electron 23
-----------

Another two BlackSky Global imaging satellites were launched on the 23rd Electron flight on Dec 9.
The flight was nicknamed 'Data with Destiny'.

IXPE
----

The IXPE (Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer) satellite was launched from Kennedy Space Center
on Dec 9 aboard a Falcon 9.

IXPE has three 0.27m-diameter grazing incidence X-ray telescopes with special detectors
that can measure X-ray polarization.  Satellite mass is about 330 kg.

SJ6
----

11 years after the previous launch in the series, the Shi Jian 6 Group
05 Sats A and B  (Shi Jian 6 hao 05 zu A/B xing) were launched from
Jiuquan on Dec 10. 

The earlier SJ6 satellites operate in a 590 km sun-synchronous orbits. 
They are thought to be signals intelligence
satellites. One of the satellites in each pair was a large SAST/Shanghai maneuverable
satellite possibly based on the FY-1 bus, and the other was a smaller
satellite that does not have orbit adjust capability. I am guessing
that the SAST satellite is the B xing, which (confusingly) is usually
assigned to object A for the launch in the US satellite catalog.  The A object
(putative B xing) carries out occasional orbit adjustments; based on the TLEs
it appears all the A objects from the earlier launches were still active
as recently as 2019.

The new Group 05 satellites, in contrast, are both built by SAST and are
in a lower orbit.

The orbital planes
(characterized by the LTDN, the local time of the orbit descending node) 
and heights are listed in the table below.

Proton
------

Roskosmos launched a Proton on Dec 13 with two Ekspress communications satellites. A slight underburn
of the Briz-M stage left the satellites in a somewhat lower than planned orbit; the satellites
have electric propulsion systems and will take somewhat longer than expected to reach their
final orbits. In accordance with the scheme for rocket statistics described in my General Catalog, I am rating this
Proton launch's success rate score as 0.80 (reached usuable but not nominal orbit).

TL2-02
------

CALT launched a CZ-3B on Dec 13 with the second of the Tian Lian 2 data relay satellites.
On around Dec 15 it began orbit raising and as of Dec 21 in was on station in GEO at 171E.

GeeSat
------

EXPACE launched a Kuaizhou-1A with two GeeSat satellites on Dec 15, but it failed to reach orbit.
Reports indicate the third stage failed and debris impacted about 1000 km downrange.
GeeSpace's 130 kg GeeSat satellites are intended to provide commercial navigation services.
GeeSpace (Shanghai) is a subsidiary of the Geely Holding Group (Hangzhou). The satellites were built
by another Geely subsidiary, Xingkong Zhilian Keji (Taizhou).

Turksat
-------

The Turksat-5B communications satellite, an Airbus Eurostar electric-propulsion vehicle with a
launch mass of 4500 kg, was placed in geotransfer orbit by a Falcon 9 on Dec 19. A small perigee
raising burn occurred on Dec 22.

Inmarsat 6
----------

The first Inmarsat 6 satellite for maritime and aviation communications was launched to supersynchronous
transfer orbit on Dec 22 by a Mitsubishi Heavy Industries H-IIA from Tanegashima. The 5740 kg Airbus 
Eurostar 3000EOR satellite carries Ka-band and L-band communications payloads.

SY-12
-----

On Dec 23, the third test flight of the Chang Zheng 7A placed two 3-tonne CAST-built Shiyan 12 satellites
in geotransfer orbit.


JWST
----

The James Webb Space Telescope was launched on Dec 25. Ariane 5 rocket L5114 took off on flight VA256
at 1220:07 UTC. The EAP solid boosters separated 2m21s after launch at 72 km altitude.
The two halves of the nose fairing were jettisoned 3m26s after launch at 126 km altitude.
The EPC core stage shut down and separarated at T+8:47, 229 km up. The ESC-D upper stage 
ignited at T+8:51 and fired for 16 minutes, cutting off at 928 km altitude with
the stack in a 315 x 1011900 km x 4.1 deg orbit. ESC-D separated from JWST at 1247 UTC, T+27:07,
and JWST deployed its solar array at 1250 UTC. The observatory carried out its first
midcourse correction, MCC-1a, at 0050 UTC to 0155 UTC Dec 26, gaining about 16 m/s. Arrival at
Sun-Earth L2 is expected in late January.

JWST has a mass of 6161 kg wet and 5861 kg dry. The spacecraft is packed into a 10.7m high 4.5m dia
form at launch but will deploy its 6.5m diameter, 18-segment primary mirror and a 21.2m x 14.2m sunshade.

JWST observes in infrared wavebands; the focal plane will be cooled to
40 Kelvin, and the active cryocooler will cool the MIRI instrument to a
mere 7 Kelvin. 

The ISIM (Integrated Science Instrument Module) carries the four JWST instruments:
 - NIRCAM (Arizona), a 0.6-5 micron near-IR camera
 - MIRI  (ESA/JPL), a mid-IR imager (5 to 28 microns)
 - NIRSPEC (ESA), a near-IR spectrograph/IFU  (0.7 to 5.3 microns)
 - NIRISS (CSA), a near-IR imager/slitless spectrograph (1.0-2.5 microns)
An Aft Deployed Instrument Radiator (ADIR) also unfolds from the ISIM.

The OTE (Optical Telescope Element)  includes the PMSA (Primary Mirror
Segment Assenbly), the +V2 and -V2 PMBA (Primary Mirror Backplane
Assemblies), and the SMSS (Secondary Mirror Support Structure) with SMA
(Secondary Mirror Assembly). The OTE is mounted on the DTA (Deployable
Tower Assembly) attached to the main spacecraft.

Also on the main spacecraft are the solar array and solar trim tab (Aft
Momentum Flap),  the GAA (Gimballed Antenna Assembly) with the high and
medium gain communications antennae, the SCAT-1 and SCAT-2 thruster
booms,  and the left and right forward and aft Unitized Pallet
Structures containing the sunshade. The sunshade includes retractable
sunshade covers,  5 sunshade layers, +J2 and -J2 sunshade booms, and
tensioning systems.

JWST is scheduled to arrive at Sun-Earth L2 on Jan 23, by which time
the mechanical deployments will be complete. However, it is expected
to take six months to align the mirror segments, perfect the guiding,
cool the focal plane, and commission the spacecraft, telescope
and instruments. We can therefore hope for the first public release
of images from the telescope sometime in June-July 2022.

ZY1-02E
-------

The Zi Yuan 1 02E remote sensing satellite was launched from Taiyuan on Dec 26,
along with a small 10 kg 6U cubesat carrying the CAS-9/XW-3 amateur radio payload,
and experiments from Beijing 101 Middle School.

OneWeb
-------

36 more OneWeb satellites were launched from Baykonur on Dec 27.


Angara
------

The third Angara A5 test flight on Dec 27 placed Energiya's Persei upper stage in
orbit. 14S48 Persei is a modified Blok DM-03. 

Erratum
-------

 In my description of the ASAT test I got the heights the wrong way round. The text should
have read:
 The intercept was about a height of 486 km above the Earth ellipsoid (468 km above the fictive
 6378 km spherical Earth used for orbit parameters).

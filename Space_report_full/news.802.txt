Welcome to the 33rd anniversary issue of JSR!


International Space Station
---------------------------

Expedition 66 continues.

On Jan 7 the Dextre arm moved the STP-H8 experiment payload from the Dragon CRS-24 trunk to the
EFU2 location on the Kibo Exposed Facility. The previous occupant of EFU2 was the defunct ISS-CREAM
experiment, which was moved to EFU7 on Dec 6.

On Jan 10 the European ASIM (Atmosphere Space Interactions Monitor) external payload was
moved by Canadarm-2 from the SDX to the SDN attach point on the Columbus module, to make room for STP-H7.
On Jan 11 STP-H7 was removed from the CRS-24 trunk and installed on SDX.

On Jan 12 at 1824 UTC the Progress MS-18 cargo ship fired its engines for 395 seconds for a 0.7m/s delta-V
to raise the ISS orbit by 1.5 km to 414 x 423 km x 51.6 deg.


Chinese Space Station - redockings of Tianzhou-2
------------------------------------------------

On Jan 3, the Tianhe module's robot arm was walked to a base point near the Tianhe forward
docking hub.

On Jan 5 the Tianzhou-2 cargo ship undocked from the Tianhe forward port at 2212 UTC and remained
stationkeeping close to the port. The robot arm then grappled the ship and maneuvered it around,
then returned it to the original capture position and released it. Tianzhou-2 then redocked with
the forward port at 2259 UTC.

On Jan 7 the crew of the CSS carried out a manually teleoperated undocking and redocking
of the Tianzhou-2 cargo ship. Tianzhou-2 undocked from the Tianhe forward port around 2200 UTC,
backed it off about 200 m, and redocked it with the same port on Tianhe at 2355 UTC.

Chinese Space Station - Starlink encounters
--------------------------------------------

China has complained to the UN (in UN document A/AC.105/1262) that
Starlink sats are buzzing the Chinese Space Station (CSS). Two incidents
are mentioned, and analysis of the TLEs confirms that the close passes
in question did indeed occur as described.

On Jul 1 at 0950 UTC the CMSEO (zhongguo zairen hangtian gongcheng
bangonghsi, China Human Spaceflight Engineering Office) commanded the
CSS to make an orbit adjustment to dodge Starlink 1095, which was in the
process of lowering its orbit towards disposal; a close (km or less)
pass would otherwise have happened at about 1315 UTC. It appears that
the Starlink also made a small avoidance burn around the same time, but
it sounds like there was no advance communication between SpaceX and the
CMSEO about the pass. 

On Oct 21 the then-recently-launched Starlink-2305 satellite was orbit
raising through the altitude of the CSS and was predicted to pass within
1 km of the  Chinese station at about 2200 UTC. The CSS made an orbit
adjustment at about 0316 UTC to avoid the encounter. In this case
Starlink-2305 does not appear to have made any avoidance burns.

Note that when a satellite is in a well tracked and stable (constant)
orbit, prediction of upcoming close passes is relatively straighforward.
But when the orbital elements of the satellites are constantly changing,
potentially unpredictably, as in the case of Starlink satellites
changing their orbit with electric propulsion, prediction of such
`conjunctions' is not reliably possible. SpaceX appears to take the view that
other space users should trust them to make avoidance burns and not hit them.
That may be sufficient for most satellites, but for spacecraft with astronauts
on board, a wider berth and more active cooperation might seem reasonable.

China says it 'has the honour to refer to article V of the [Outer Space
Treaty] which provide that [States] should immediately inform the other
[member states] of any phenomena they discover in outer space ... which
could consititute a danger to the life or health of astronauts'. In
other words, implying that SpaceX is such a phenomenon!

China also 'brings to the attention [of] all States parties to the Outer
Space Treaty ... article VI ... States ... bear interational
responsibility for national activities .. whether by governmental
agencies or by non-governmetnal entities...'. In other words, what
SpaceX is doing is the responsibility of the US government.

One should note that the ISS has had to do dodge Chinese space debris
several times over the years, so no-one is pure here. However, I am
encouraged that China is raising the profile of this issue at the UN -
there's been a lot of informal discussion and sniping in the press, but
it's very unusual to have a formal document presented to the UN by one
country complaining about another country's space activities. Taking it
seriously would provide an opportunity not only to have action on this
issue, but also to bring China itself into  better compliance with
international norms (on upper stage disposal, for example).

Tianhui-4
----------

China's SAST launched a CZ-2D on Dec 29 with the Tianhui-4 mapping satellite.
The launch report mentions a test of a dual satellite adapter, but it wasn't made clear
if there were actually two Tianhui-4s aboard. Two objects were cataloged; object
A manuevered to synchronize its orbit 200 km from object B on Jan 5, suggesting
that both are payloads. A gravity mapping application like the GRACE mission
is one possible interpretation.

Unlike earlier Tianhui sats which were sun-sync, the Dec 29 launch went
to an inclination of 89 degrees.

The Tianhui series naming is rather confusing:

TJS 9
------

China's CALT launched at CZ-3B on Dec 29 with the Tongxing Jishu Shiyan 9 experimental
communications satellite. It was reported to be for multi-band, high speed
communications experiments, but may be a Qianshao-3 signals intelligence satellite.
The satellite had reached a GEO position of 137.2E by Jan 7.

Simorgh
-------

Iran launched a Simorgh rocket from Khomeini Space Center at 0330 UTC Dec 30.
Iranian news agencies reported that the rocket released multiple
payloads at an altitude of 470 km and a velocity of 7.350 km/s. They did not claim that
orbit was reached, but did not specify if the cited velocity was inertial or Earth-relative.
It seems unlikely that a deliberate suborbital test would get so close to orbital
velocity - for the cited conditions, assumed inertial, that's only about 200 m/s short
of successfully reaching orbit. I am therefore logging this as an orbital launch
failure and assigning it designation 2021-F11.

However, I have decided that the evidence for the alleged Jun 23 Simorgh failure, which
I assigned designation 2021-F04, is too skimpy, and I have removed it from the General Catalog. 

My reconstruction of the Dec 30 launch suggests that the payloads and upper stage may have reentered
south of Australia about 28 minutes after launch.

Starlink
---------

49 Starlink satellites, Group 4-5, were launched on Jan 6. The Falcon 9 flew on a new trajectory southeast
from Kennedy Space Center. 

Transporter-3
-------------

On Jan 13 SpaceX launched the Transporter-3 mission from Cape Canaveral. Attached to the Falcon 9 second
stage was a dispenser column consisting of three ESPA rings, carrying over 100 payloads.
After the payloads were deployed into a 1000 LTDN sun-sync orbit, the second stage was deorbited.
The payloads included a number of PocketQubes, the next step down in size from Cubesats; a 1P cubesat
is a 0.05m cube with a mass of about 0.2 kg.

LauncherOne
-----------

On Jan 13 Virgin Orbit's 747 Cosmic Girl took off from Mojave at 2139 UTC and flew out over the Pacific.
At 2252 UTC over  120.78W 32.34N it dropped LauncherOne R5, whose first stage ignited about 4 seconds later.
The rocket flew southeast to enter a parking orbit at the first cutoff of the second\
stage, at 2301 UTC, of 194 x 524 km x 45 deg. A second upper stage burn at 2346 UTC circularized
the orbit at apogee and the seven payloads were deployed:
   STORK-3, a 3U imaging satellite for the Polish company SatRevolution
   SteamSat-2, a 3U satellite built by SatRevolution for SteamJet (UK) which will test a water thruster.
   ADLER-1, for the Osterreichisches Weltraum Forum, a 3U satellite built by Spire which will study microscopic
     space debris.
   GEARRS-3, for Near Space Launch (Indiana) and the AF Research Lab, a 3U satellite to test a system to 
     relay spacecraft health data via Globalstar satellites.
   TechEdSat-13, a (probably 3U?) satellite from NASA-Ames to test an exobrake reentry system
   PAN A and B, two 3U Cornell-developed satellites to test out cubesat rendezvous and docking.

Shiyan 13
----------

The first Chinese launch of the year put Shiyan 13 in a 1300 km apogee elliptical orbit.


DSCOVR upper stage
------------------

The inert Falcon 9 upper stage from the 2015 DSCOVR launch made a 9300 km (untargeted, obviously)
flyby of the Moon on Jan 5, which left it in a lower perigee orbit of 28583 x 554291 km x 26.9 deg;
further lunisolar perturbations mean that it may reenter soon. Thanks to Bill Gray for analysis.

Angara
-------

As reported in the last JSR, the third Angara A5 test flight on Dec 27
placed Energiya's 14S48 Persei (modified Blok DM-03) upper stage in
orbit.  The Novosti Kosmonavtiki forum reported that the Persei upper
stage failed to restart after its first burn, and so was stranded in low
parking orbit. Space Force tracking showed an orbit of 179 x 201 km. The
vehicle probably had an initial mass in orbit of around 20 tonnes, but
with likely venting of the liquid propellant would have been  more like
4 tonnes at the time of reentry at 2108 UTC Jan 5 over the Pacifc at
121W 14S. Three additional debris objects of unknown nature were also
cataloged and have also reentered.

Webb
----

As of Jan 9, Webb's sunshade and secondary mirror were successfully deployed and the two side primary mirror 
wings had unfolded. Webb continues its coast to Sun-Earth L2 as adjustment of the mirror element positions
begins.

Erratum:
--------
 Dragon CRS-24 docked to the IDA-3 docking port, not IDA-2.

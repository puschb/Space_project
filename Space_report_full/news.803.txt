International Space Station
---------------------------

Expedition 66 continues.

On Jan 19 astronauts Shkaplerov and Dubrov made a spacewalk from the Poisk airlock
to work on outfitting the new Prichal module. The airlock wsa
depressurized around 1150 UTC and the hatch was open at 1218 UTC. Dubrov, in suit
Orlan MKS4, and Shkaplerov - in suit MKS5 - emerged at 1225 and 1236 UTC,
and used the Strela crane to reach the Nauka module, then crawled down
to Prichal. They installed handrails, cables and two antennas. They
relocated a TV camera, and installed two docking targets.
At 1729 UTC Jan 19 the astronauts jettisoned the docking target cover;
at 1810 and 1811 UTC two antenna covers were jettisoned; and at 1905 and
1906 UTC two cleaning towels were thrown into space after the astronauts
wiped themselves down to avoid bringing any thruster contamination into
the airlock. At 1910 and 1915 UTC respectively Shkaplerov and Dubrov
went back inside the airlock, with hatch closure at 1929 UTC and
repressurization beginning at 1932 UTC.

Cargo ship Dragon CRS-24 undocked from IDA-3 at 1540 UTC Jan 23 and at about 1755 UTC
lowered its orbit to 186 x 377 km x 51.6 deg. It jettisoned the trunk into a 184 x 369 km orbit
and made its deorbit burn at 2018 UTC Jan 24, splashing down in the Gulf of Mexico
near Panama City, at around 86.2W 29.7N at about 2105 UTC.

On Jan 26 the Japanese RMS arm extracted Nanoracks NRCSD-22 from the Kibo airlock;
NRCSD-22 then ejected five cubesats. On Feb 3 the JRMS was used similarly with the JAXA
J-SSOD #20 deployer, ejecting two cubesats.

On Feb 8 at 0736 UTC the engines of Progress MS-18 were fired to change the ISS orbit by 0.3 m/s.

Progress MS-19 was launched from Baykonur on Feb 15 with 2523 kg of cargo including six 3U amateur
radio satellites for later manual EVA deployment. The ship docked with the Poisk module at 0703:20 UTC Feb 17.

Northrop Grumman Cygnus cargo ship NG-17, the S.S. Piers Sellers, was launched on Feb 19.
It arrived at ISS on Feb 21; SSRMS grappled it at 0944 UTC and berthed it at Unity nadir at 1202 UTC.

GSSAP
------

Two GSSAP geosynch space surveillance sats for the Space Force were launched on Jan 21 at 1900 UTC
by a ULA Atlas V 511. This is the only flight of the 511 model, with one strapon SRM booster,
a single-engine Centaur, and a 5-meter-diameter fairing.

The Centaur reached a 176 x 319 km x 28.0 deg parking orbit at 1913 UTC and a 231 x 36329 km x 26.0
deg geotransfer orbit at 2013 UTC. Deployment of the payloads in circular  36100 km orbits occurred
at 0135 and 0145 UTC Jan 22.

The payloads were also given the cover designations USA 324 and USA 325. 

Ludi Tance
----------

At 2344 UTC Jan 25 China's SAST launched a CZ-4C from Jiuquan with the
Ludi Tance 1 hao 01 zu A xing, a 3200 kg L-band SAR satellite. The name
translates as Land Probe 1 Group 01 Sat A.

CSG2
----

The second Cosmo-Skymed Second Generation radar satellite, FM2, was
launched by SpaceX on Jan 31 into the same 17:46 local time orbital plane as FM1. The
X-band SAR satellite is operated by ASI (the Italian space agency) and
the Italian Ministry of Defence.

USA 326
-------

A new large imaging reconnaissance satellite for the US National Reconnaissance Office is now
in orbit after launch from Vandenberg Space Force Base by a SpaceX Falcon 9 on Feb 2.


Kosmos-2553
-----------

On Feb 5 Russia launched a military satellite from the Plesetsk spaceport into an unusual
orbit nearly 2000 km high. With the cover name Kosmos-2553, the satellite is thought to be
the first Neitron radar satellite, built by NPO Masinostroenie. The Soyuz-2a third
stage flew a suborbital trajectory to the western Pacific; the Fregat upper stage
made several burns to reach the target orbit and a final one after payload separation
to deorbit itself. It's not immediately obvious which ocean was used for the Fregat disposal.

Starlink
---------

49 more Starlinks (Group 4-6) were launched to the Group 4 shell on Jan
19. The Falcon 9 first stage landed on the droneship A Shortfall Of
Gravitas.

Starlink Group 4-7, with 49 satellites, was launched from Kennedy Space
Center on Feb 3. However, a geomagnetic storm on Feb 4 meant that
atmospheric density was larger than expected and drag forces exceeded
the ability of the satellites to operate correctly. According to SpaceX
(spacex.com, Feb 8), `the increased drag at the low altitudes prevented
the satellites from leaving safe-mode to begin orbit raising maneuvers,
and up to 40 of the satellites will reenter or already have reentered
the Earth's atmosphere.' In fact, 11 satellites appear to have survived,
with 38 reentering within a few days.

Starlink Group 4-8 was launched from Cape Canaveral on Feb 21, this time
using a two-burn insertion profile to a slightly higher deployment orbit.
The number of satellites aboard was reduced to 46 as a result.

OneWeb
------

On Feb 10, 34 OneWeb satellites were launched on an Arianespace Soyuz from French Guiana.


Astra LV0008
-------------

Astra Rocket 3.3, mission LV0008, was launched from Cape Canaveral on
Feb 10 carrying four cubesats: BAMA-1 for the U. of Alabama, QubeSat for
Berkeley, INCA for NMSU, and R5-S1 for Johnson Space Center. Three minutes
after launch the first stage shut down but there was some kind of problem
during fairing and first stage separation; the vehicle tumbled and did not
reach orbit.

Transporter 3
--------------

Four previously unknown US military payloads, USA 320 to USA 323, have
been cataloged associated with the Transporter 3 launch. The OroraTech
infrared imager, FOREST, is aboard the 6U satellite Lemur-2-Rohovithsa.
D-Orbit's ION SCV 004 has deployed the VZLUSat-2, STORK-1 and 2, LabSat,
Dodona and SW1FT cubesats.

Corrections to last week's Transporter 3 comments: Three, not four,
Unicorn-2 imaging sats (2A,2D,2E); and aboard ION-SCV I missed the SW1FT
cubesat from SatRevolution. ICEYE X14 is US-licenced and is probably the
Orbital Effects XR-2 satellite.


Shiyan 12
----------

The two Shiyan 12 satellites launched in December maintained a 100 km separation at 94E in GEO
until Jan 8, when they moved about 40 km above GEO and began proximity operations, staying within
5 km of each other most of the time since Jan 18.

PSLV-C52
----------

ISRO launched the PSLV-C52 mission on Feb 14. The rocket placed the 1710 kg RISAT-1A (EOS-04) C-band
radar imaging satellite in a 0600 LTDN sun-synch orbit. Two secondary payloads
were also deployed: INS-2TD, a 17 kg ISRO test satellite with a thermal imager, and
InspireSat-1, an 8 kg satellite with a solar X-ray spectrometer. InspireSat-1 is a joint project
of the Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology  in Thiruvananthapuram and the University of
Colorado's LASP space physics lab.

Upper stage to hit moon
-----------------------

Further analysis by Bill Gray shows that an  upper stage, abandoned
since 2014, will actually impact the lunar farside at around 1222 UTC
Mar 4. Originally thought to be a Falcon 9 upper stage from the 2015
DSCOVR launch, further backtracking of the orbit data now shows that it
is actually the CZ-3C Y12 third stage from China's Chang'e-5T1  lunar
test mission, launched in Oct 2014. (China issued a confusing statement
saying it wasn't the booster from Chang'e-5 - the 2020 followon mission -
which no-one was claiming it was anyway).

Following a flyby of the Moon soon after launch, the stage remained
in a 350000 x 565000 km x 57.4 deg deep Earth orbit in
the outer part of the Earth-Moon system. The perigee was close to lunar
distance, making eventual further lunar encounters  inevitable. Orbits
like this are somewhat chaotic, their orbital parameters strongly
affected over time by lunar and solar gravity as well as the Earth.

Further lunar flybys occurred: 23573 km on 2016 Jan 17, and 9312 km on
2022 Jan 5. This last flyby sent the stage on an elliptical
orbit that came as low as 25000 km from the Earth, on Jan 21, then out
again to lunar distance. It will come back in to 45000 km  perigee on
Feb 9 on a path for a fatal last apogee at 688000 km on Feb 23 from
which it will fall back in to hit the Moon on Mar 4.

The stage is about 4 tonnes and it will hit the Moon at 2.5 km/s.

We know lots of junk from lunar missions has ended up hitting the Moon,
for example upper stages from lunar missions and junk left in lunar
orbit. The LCROSS mission deliberately smashed a Centaur stage (similar size)
into the Moon on 2009 Oct 9, with a special spacecraft following behind
it to study the impact. 

This is the first time that something not explicitly targeted at
the Moon has been noticed to accidentally hit it, but that's mainly
because we weren't paying attention until recently. Thanks to Bill Gray
and a few other people who have spent their own time keeping track of
the space junk that's too far out for SpaceForce to care about, we can
now spot events like this. Amazingly it is no one's paid job to do -
the fact that the stage was initially misidentified adds emphasis to
our lack of knowledge of the artificial objects abandoned in cislunar space.

There are about 30 to 50 lost deep space objects like this that have
been missing for years - 50 years in some cases - that haven't been
picked up by asteroid searches, and probably some of them hit the moon
without us noticing. This is not 'the launch agency did something bad' - it's
perfectly standard practice to abandon stuff in deep orbit - this is
'none of the space agencies care about leaving stuff out beyond the
Moon'.

Traffic in deep space is increasing.  And it's not like the old days with
just the USA and the USSR sending stuff to deep space, it's many countries and even
commercial companies like SpaceX. So I think it's time for the world to
get more serious about regulating and cataloging deep space activity.

Thanks to Bill Gray and Dan Adamo for sterling astrodynamics work
sorting this out.

Oh, and where is the DSCOVR booster? Based on extrapolation of
a dataset provided by SpaceX, Dan Adamo derives a prediction which
implies it left the Earth-Moon system in March 2015 and is now
in a 0.95 x 0.99 AU x 0.1 deg heliocentric orbit.

SJ-21
-----

China's Shi Jian 21 turns out to be the first space garbage truck. On Jan 21 it
appears to have docked with the defunct Beidou 2-G2 satellite drifting
in GEO and then raised its orbit above GEO. On Jan 27 Beidou was tracked
in a 36076 x 38886 km orbit, 290 x 3100 km above GEO, and SJ-21 had lowered its
orbit back to the GEO ring.

International Space Station
---------------------------

Expedition 66 continues.

Soyuz MS-21 (spacecraft No. 750, named 'S.P. Korolev') was launched from Baykonur on Mar 18 with a crew of three
Russian astronauts: Oleg Artem'ev, Denis Matveev and Sergey Korsakov (crew callsign: Don). The ship docked with
the new Prichal module about 3h 16m 46s after launch, at 1912:04 UTC.


Starlink
---------

Group 4-11, with 50 satellites, was launched from Vandenberg on Feb 25 using a two-burn profile.
The Falcon 9 first stage landed on the OCISLY drone ship.

Group 4-9, with 49 satellites, was launched from Kennedy on Mar 3 using the two-burn profile,
with stage 1 landing on JRTI.

Group 4-10, with 48 satellites, was launched from Canaveral on Mar 9. Stage 1 landed on ASOG.

LT-01B
------

The second SAST/Shanghai LSAR radar satellite, Ludi Tance 01B, was launched on
Feb 26. It will work in tandem with the first satellite launched on Jan
25.

GOES T
------

ULA launched Atlas V AV-095 from Canaveral on Mar 1 with NOAA's GOES T geostationary
weather satellite, which it deployed into a 8896 x 35276 km  x 9.4 deg transfer
orbit. By Mar 18 it was in a 35579 x 35712 km x 0.1 deg geosync drift orbit and NOAA
renamed the satellite GOES 18. 

CZ-8
----

The second Chang Zheng 8 mission was launched on Feb 27. This launch, unlike the first one,
used a variant omitting the side boosters. It placed a cluster of small satellites in orbit:

  Hainan 1-01 and 1-02 are satellites with imaging and AIS (ship tracking) payloads for
    the Sanyi Research Institute (part of CAS RADI), built by Shenzhen DFH. They will carry out maritime
    surveillance. Satellite 1-01 has a wide field imager and 1-02 has a 1.5m resolution video camera.

  Wenchang-1 01 and 02 are also for the Sanyi Research Institute, They were built by MinoSpace and
  have wide format multispectral imagers to be used for oceanography, resource and agriculture monitoring.

  Taijing-3 01 is a Minospace MN-200 class imaging satellite with a 0.5m resolution visible-light camera.
  Taijing-4 01 is also a Minospace MN-200 class satellite, with a 1 m resolution X-band SAR radar.

  Xidian-1 (XD-1) is a smaller Minospace satellite with a hyperspectral sensor for Shaanxi Silu Tiantu 
  Weixing Keji. 

  Chaohu-1 is a radar satellite for the Tiandi Information Network, and is a followon to the Hisea-1
  radar test satellite. It was built by Tianyi Research (Spacety).

  Chuangxing Leishen is a research satellite from Tianyi in collaboration with the  Beijing Univ. 
   of Posts and Telecoms Research Institute.  It carries a distributed software processing experiment.
  Additional science payloads include the Jiguang-2 X-ray polarimeter, and three GRID gamma ray burst detectors.
  
  Tianqi-19 is an IoT data relay satellite for Guodian Gaokeji.

  Xingshidai-17 is a remote sensing satellite for Guoxing Yuhang Keji (ADA Space). It is also named
   Dayun, in honor of the Universiade sports event to be held in Chengdu and called Dayunhui in Chinese.

  Qimingxing-1 is a 19 kg imaging satellite from Wuhan University with visible and IR imagers and a 
   hyperspectral sensor.

  Xiamen Keji 1 (Jilin-1 Mofang 02A 01) is a 30 kg imaging satellite built by Changguang Satellite Tech for
    Xiamen Tianwei Keji with a 1m resolution imager.

  Jilin-1 Gaofen 03D 10 to 18 are 9 high resolution imaging satellites from Changguang Satellite Tech,
    probably with a mass of 42 kg each. Satellite 15 is sponsored by the city of Shaoguan; satellites 16 and 17,
    also called Wenchang Chaosuan 2 and 3, are sponsored by Wenchang Supercomputing Centre; satellite 18
    is also called Anxi Teiguanyin 1, apparently named after a famous variety of oolong tea from Fujian.


Strix-Beta
-----------

RocketLab inaugurated the Mahia launch site's second pad, pad 1B, on Feb 28 with the launch of the Strix Beta
radar satellite for Japan's Synspective.


Yinhe
-----
 
   Six Yinhe internet satellites were launched on Mar 5 for Yinghe Hantian (Galaxy Aerospace). The satellites,
each with a mass of about 190 kg, strongly resemble the OneWeb series. A small Xuanming remote sensing
cubesat was also deployed.

Noor 2
------

 The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps launched its second satellite on Mar 8 using the Qased launch vehicle
from Shahroud. Noor 2 is an imaging satellite reported to be an improved version of Noor 1, which is still
said to be operating.

Astra LV0009
------------

Astra had its second orbital success on Mar 15 in a launch from Kodiak. A number of
commercial satellites were deployed into sun-synch orbit. At first the only acknowledged deployment was ORESAT0,
a 1U cubesat from Portland State Aerospace Society. The NearSpaceLaunch S4-CROSSOVER payload remained
attached to the upper stage; it carries an EyeStar-S4 package for satellite-to-satellite communications.
Twenty 0.25U SpaceBees for Swarm were also deployed; their presence on the flight was not announced until Mar 17.

Yaogan 34-02
--------------

On Mar 17 China launched the second Yaogan 34 military imaging satellite into a 1000 km orbit.
